In\ndimension one, we find explicit formulas in the special case when the running\ncost is a power of the acceleration (in absolute value) and the terminal cost\nis zero. For more general costs or/and higher dimensions, we study the\nsingularities of the value function. We also prove the closedness (in the C 1\ntopology) of the graph of the multivalued mapping which maps a point in the\nstate space to the set of optimal trajectories which start from this point. A\nconsequence of the latter is the existence, under general assumptions, of\nrelaxed equilibria for a class of kinetic mean field games with state\nconstraints."}

This paper introduces\nL2M-AID, a novel framework for Autonomous Industrial Defense using\nLLM-empowered, Multi-agent reinforcement learning. L2M-AID orchestrates a team\nof collaborative agents, each driven by a Large Language Model (LLM), to\nachieve adaptive and resilient security. The core innovation lies in the deep\nfusion of two AI paradigms: we leverage an LLM as a semantic bridge to\ntranslate vast, unstructured telemetry into a rich, contextual state\nrepresentation, enabling agents to reason about adversary intent rather than\nmerely matching patterns. This semantically-aware state empowers a Multi-Agent\nReinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithm, MAPPO, to learn complex cooperative\nstrategies. The MARL reward function is uniquely engineered to balance security\nobjectives (threat neutralization) with operational imperatives, explicitly\npenalizing actions that disrupt physical process stability. To validate our\napproach, we conduct extensive experiments on the benchmark SWaT dataset and a\nnovel synthetic dataset generated based on the MITRE ATT&CK for ICS framework.\nResults demonstrate that L2M-AID significantly outperforms traditional IDS,\ndeep learning anomaly detectors, and single-agent RL baselines across key\nmetrics, achieving a 97.2% detection rate while reducing false positives by\nover 80% and improving response times by a factor of four.

We propose SHADOW (Strategic-communication Hybrid\nAction Decision-making under partial Observation for Warfare), a multi-headed\nsequential reinforcement learning framework that integrates continuous\nnavigation control, discrete communication actions, and opponent modeling for\nbehavior prediction. Empirical evaluations show that SHADOW pursuers achieve\nhigher success rates than six competitive baselines. Our ablation study\nconfirms that temporal sequence modeling and opponent modeling are critical for\neffective decision-making. Finally, our sensitivity analysis reveals that the\nlearned policies generalize well across varying communication risks and\nphysical asymmetries between agents."}

However, the contribution of\nreflections to performance improvement remains unclear. In this paper, we\nsystematically analyze the rollouts of eight reasoning models on five\nmathematical datasets. We focus on reflective behaviours where the model has\nalready produced an answer but continues reflecting before finalizing its\noutput. Our analysis reveals that reflections are predominantly confirmatory\nand rarely alter the model's initial answer, a pattern consistent across models\nand datasets. To understand the role of reflections in training, we construct\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets with varying amounts of reflection steps.\nWe observe that training models on rollouts with more reflection steps\nprimarily enhances first-answer correctness rather than the ability to correct\ninitially wrong answers through reflections. This motivates us to propose a\nquestion-aware early-stopping method that enhances inference-time token\nefficiency by stopping the reasoning process once a few plausible candidate\nanswers are generated, thereby reducing unnecessary reflection steps. Motivated\nby this, we further propose to dynamically truncate the reflections after a\ncandidate answer has appeared during generation, which reduces reasoning tokens\nby 24.5% across five mathematical datasets, within a 2.9% drop in accuracy."}

As a result, most current agents rely on supervised fine-tuning on\nexpert data, which is challenging to scale and generalizes poorly. This\nlimitation stems from the nature of expert demonstrations: they capture only a\nnarrow range of scenarios and expose the agent to limited environment\ndiversity. We address this limitation with a middle-ground paradigm we call\nearly experience: interaction data generated by the agent's own actions, where\nthe resulting future states serve as supervision without reward signals. Within\nthis paradigm we study two strategies of using such data: (1) Implicit world\nmodeling, which uses collected states to ground the policy in environment\ndynamics; and (2) Self-reflection, where the agent learns from its suboptimal\nactions to improve reasoning and decision-making.

To address this, the\nDivide2Conquer (D2C) method was previously proposed, which partitions training\ndata into multiple subsets and trains identical models independently on each.\nThis strategy enables learning more consistent patterns while minimizing the\ninfluence of individual outliers and noise. However, D2C's standard aggregation\ntypically treats all subset models equally or based on fixed heuristics (like\ndata size), potentially underutilizing information about their varying\ngeneralization capabilities. Building upon this foundation, we introduce\nDynamic Uncertainty-Aware Divide2Conquer (DUA-D2C), an advanced technique that\nrefines the aggregation process. DUA-D2C dynamically weights the contributions\nof subset models based on their performance on a shared validation set,\nconsidering both accuracy and prediction uncertainty. This intelligent\naggregation allows the central model to preferentially learn from subsets\nyielding more generalizable and confident edge models, thereby more effectively\ncombating overfitting. Empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets spanning\nmultiple domains demonstrate that DUA-D2C significantly improves\ngeneralization. Our analysis includes evaluations of decision boundaries, loss\ncurves, and other performance metrics, highlighting the effectiveness of\nDUA-D2C.

Gap to Centralization: Even as MGS approaches infinity, a\nnon-negligible gap in generalization error remains compared to centralized\nmini-batch SGD ($\\mathcal{O}(T^{\\frac{c\\beta}{c\\beta +1}}/{n m})$ in\ncentralized and $\\mathcal{O}(T^{\\frac{2c\\beta}{2c\\beta +2}}/{n\nm^{\\frac{1}{2c\\beta +2}}})$ in decentralized). Furthermore, we provide the\nfirst unified analysis of how factors like learning rate, data heterogeneity,\nnode count, per-node sample size, and communication topology impact the\ngeneralization of MGS under non-convex settings without the bounded gradients\nassumption, filling a critical theoretical gap in decentralized training.\nFinally, promising experiments on CIFAR datasets support our theoretical\nfindings."}

This paper presents a novel\nperspective: instead of primarily developing new complex techniques from\nscratch, we explore synergistically leveraging well-established, individually\n'weak' auxiliary models - specialized for tackling either class imbalance or\nlabel noise but not both. This view is motivated by the insight that class\nimbalance (a distributional-level concern) and label noise (a sample-level\nconcern) operate at different granularities, suggesting that robustness\nmechanisms for each can in principle offer complementary strengths without\nconflict. We propose Dual-granularity Sinkhorn Distillation (D-SINK), a novel\nframework that enhances dual robustness by distilling and integrating\ncomplementary insights from such 'weak', single-purpose auxiliary models.\nSpecifically, D-SINK uses an optimal transport-optimized surrogate label\nallocation to align the target model's sample-level predictions with a\nnoise-robust auxiliary and its class distributions with an imbalance-robust\none.

Chief among these is the urgent need for a new, unified paradigm\nfor trustworthy evaluation, as current benchmarks increasingly reveal critical\nvulnerabilities. Issues like data contamination and selective reporting by\nmodel developers fuel hype, while inadequate data quality control can lead to\nbiased evaluations that, even if unintentionally, may favor specific\napproaches. As a flood of participants enters the AI space, this \"Wild West\" of\nassessment makes distinguishing genuine progress from exaggerated claims\nexceptionally difficult. Such ambiguity blurs scientific signals and erodes\npublic confidence, much as unchecked claims would destabilize financial markets\nreliant on credible oversight from agencies like Moody's.\n  In high-stakes human examinations (e.g., SAT, GRE), substantial effort is\ndevoted to ensuring fairness and credibility; why settle for less in evaluating\nAI, especially given its profound societal impact? This position paper argues\nthat the current laissez-faire approach is unsustainable. We contend that true,\nsustainable AI advancement demands a paradigm shift: a unified, live, and\nquality-controlled benchmarking framework robust by construction, not by mere\ncourtesy and goodwill. To this end, we dissect the systemic flaws undermining\ntoday's AI evaluation, distill the essential requirements for a new generation\nof assessments, and introduce PeerBench, a community-governed, proctored\nevaluation blueprint that embodies this paradigm through sealed execution, item\nbanking with rolling renewal, and delayed transparency.

We revisit this problem and show\nthat widely used evaluation metrics systematically underestimate model\ncapability. To address this, we introduce a group matching score that better\nexploits group structure and reveals substantial hidden capability in both\ncontrastive vision-language models (VLMs) and multimodal large language models\n(MLLMs). Moreover, simply overfitting to the induced group matchings at test\ntime transfers this hidden capability into higher scores under standard\nevaluation metrics, closing much of the reported gap. This adjustment enables\nSigLIP-B16 to surpass all previous results and GPT-4.1 to yield the first\nresult surpassing estimated human performance on Winoground.\n  Building on this insight, we propose Test-Time Matching (TTM), an iterative,\nself-improving algorithm that further bootstraps model performance without any\nexternal supervision. TTM delivers additional, non-trivial improvements: for\nexample, TTM enables SigLIP-B16 to surpass GPT-4.1 on MMVP-VLM, establishing a\nnew state of the art. Importantly, TTM remains broadly effective even on\nbenchmarks without metric-induced effects or group structures, achieving\nrelative gains up to 85.7% on challenging datasets such as WhatsUp.

These previous works have found that language\nmodel embeddings can be used to reconstruct the original values, however, they\ndo not evaluate whether language models actually model continuous values as\ncontinuous. Using expected properties of the embedding space, including linear\nreconstruction and principal component analysis, we show that language models\nnot only represent numeric spaces as non-continuous but also introduce\nsignificant noise. Using models from three major providers (OpenAI, Google\nGemini and Voyage AI), we show that while reconstruction is possible with high\nfidelity ($R^2 \\geq 0.95$), principal components only explain a minor share of\nvariation within the embedding space. This indicates that many components\nwithin the embedding space are orthogonal to the simple numeric input space.\nFurther, both linear reconstruction and explained variance suffer with\nincreasing decimal precision, despite the ordinal nature of the input space\nbeing fundamentally unchanged.

Recent results reveal a crossover phenomenon: while RLVR models\noutperform the base model at small k values, the base model usually outperforms\nthem when sampling a very large number of completions. This has been\ninterpreted as evidence that base models have a larger reasoning boundary. We\nargue that on tasks with discrete answer spaces, such as math with numeric\noutputs, Pass@k at large k reflects the increasingly higher chance of success\nin the limit of the number of trials rather than genuine reasoning, and can\ntherefore be misleading. We propose Cover@tau, which measures the fraction of\nproblems that a model can solve for which at least a tau proportion of\ncompletions are correct.

As a result, they cannot leverage past full trajectories or share\ninformation across branches, limiting self-evolving ability and search space\ndiversity.

Strategic information gathering requires models to know not only how to\neffectively acquire information, but also when to stop gathering information\nand make a decision, in order to avoid overthinking or getting derailed when\nacting. In this paper, we formalize this problem and introduce Counterfactuals\nand Reasoning for Termination (CaRT), an approach for teaching LLMs when to\nstop seeking information. To appropriately learn when to terminate, CaRT\nfine-tunes LLMs using counterfactual pairs of trajectories, one where\ntermination is appropriate and a minimally modified version of the same\ntrajectory where it is not. It trains the LLM to explain the rationale for the\ntermination decision in either case via verbal reasoning, and imbues this\ncapability into the base LLM via fine-tuning. We instantiate CaRT in two\ndomains: interactive medical diagnosis and math problem solving. In both\ndomains, we find that CaRT improves the efficiency of information gathering and\ntask success rate compared to other fine-tuning methods."}
