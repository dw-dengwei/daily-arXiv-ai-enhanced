We refine this picture: for each layer $\\ell$ we define a collision discriminant $\u0394^\\ell \\subset \u0398$ and injective stratum $U^\\ell = \u0398\\setminus \u0394^\\ell$, and prove a dichotomy -- either the model is nowhere injective on the set, or $U^\\ell$ is open and dense and every $F^\\ell_\u03b8$ is injective. Under mild non-singularity assumptions on the optimizer and an absolutely continuous initialization, generic injectivity persists along smooth training trajectories over any fixed horizon. We also treat symmetry groups $G$, showing that discriminants and injective strata descend to the quotient $\u0398/G$, so injectivity is naturally a property of functional equivalence classes.\n  We complement these results with an empirical study of layerwise geometric diagnostics. We define a separation margin and a co-Lipschitz (lower Lipschitz) constant between prompt space and last-token representation space, estimated via nearest-neighbor statistics on large prompt sets. Applying these diagnostics to pretrained LLaMA-3 and Qwen models, we study behavior across layers, sequence lengths, model scales, and 8- and 4-bit activation quantization. On our sampled prompts we see no collisions in full precision or at 8 bits, while 4-bit quantization induces a small number of collisions and markedly shrinks co-Lipschitz estimates. For a small GPT-2 trained from scratch, normalized metrics remain stable over training. Overall, the results suggest that Transformer representations are generically and persistently injective in the continuous-parameter idealization, while their practical invertibility can be probed using simple geometric diagnostics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4ec5\u89e3\u7801\u5668Transformer\u4e2d\u4ece\u79bb\u6563\u63d0\u793a\u5230\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u4e2atoken\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u6620\u5c04\u7684\u6ce8\u5165\u6027\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u7a20\u5bc6\u7684\u6ce8\u5165\u5c42\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u51e0\u4f55\u8bca\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3Transformer\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u4ece\u79bb\u6563\u63d0\u793a\u5230\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u6620\u5c04\u662f\u5426\u5177\u6709\u6ce8\u5165\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u5982\u4f55\u7f16\u7801\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u53ef\u9006\u6027\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u78b0\u649e\u5224\u522b\u5f0f\u548c\u6ce8\u5165\u5c42\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u4e8c\u5206\u6027\u8d28\uff1b\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u5206\u79bb\u4f59\u91cf\u548c\u5171Lipschitz\u5e38\u6570\u7b49\u51e0\u4f55\u8bca\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728LLaMA-3\u3001Qwen\u548cGPT-2\u7b49\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u53c2\u6570\u7406\u60f3\u5316\u4e0b\uff0cTransformer\u8868\u793a\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u6301\u7eed\u6ce8\u5165\u7684\uff1b\u57288\u4f4d\u91cf\u5316\u4e0b\u672a\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u78b0\u649e\uff0c4\u4f4d\u91cf\u5316\u4f1a\u5f15\u5165\u5c11\u91cf\u78b0\u649e\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u7f29\u5c0f\u5171Lipschitz\u4f30\u8ba1\uff1b\u5c0f\u578bGPT-2\u7684\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6307\u6807\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "conclusion": "Transformer\u8868\u793a\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u53c2\u6570\u7406\u60f3\u5316\u4e0b\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u6301\u7eed\u6ce8\u5165\u7684\uff0c\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u53ef\u9006\u6027\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u8bca\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u63a2\u6d4b\u3002"}}

Compared with LLMs, human reasoning can derive corresponding modifications to the output based on certain kinds of changes to the input. This reasoning pattern, which relies on abstract rules that govern relationships between changes of data, has not been comprehensively described or evaluated in LLMs. In this paper, we formally define this reasoning pattern as the Derivation Relation (DR) and introduce the concept of Derivation Capability (DC), i.e. applying DR by making the corresponding modification to the output whenever the input takes certain changes. To assess DC, a systematically constructed evaluation framework named DEVAL is proposed and used to evaluate five popular LLMs and one Large Reasoning Model in seven mainstream tasks. The evaluation results show that mainstream LLMs, such as GPT-4o and Claude3.5, exhibit moderate DR recognition capabilities but reveal significant drop-offs on applying DR effectively in problem-solving scenarios. To improve this, we propose a novel prompt engineering approach called Derivation Prompting (DP).

Current RL methods, exemplified by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), suffer from coarse-grained, trajectory-level rewards that provide insufficient learning signals for complex multi-turn interactions, leading to training stagnation. To address this issue, we propose Group Turn Policy Optimization (GTPO), a novel RL algorithm specifically designed for training LLMs on multi-turn TIR tasks. GTPO introduces three key innovations: (1) turn-level reward assignment that provides fine-grained feedback for individual turns, (2) return-based advantage estimation where normalized discounted returns are calculated as advantages, and (3) self-supervised reward shaping that exploits self-supervision signals from generated code to densify sparse binary outcome-based rewards. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that GTPO outperforms GRPO by 3.0% on average across diverse reasoning benchmarks, establishing its effectiveness for advancing complex mathematical reasoning in the real world.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86GTPO\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56de\u5408\u7ea7\u5956\u52b1\u5206\u914d\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u56de\u62a5\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5956\u52b1\u5851\u9020\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709RL\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u56de\u5408\u5de5\u5177\u96c6\u6210\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709RL\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u56de\u5408\u5de5\u5177\u96c6\u6210\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u8f68\u8ff9\u7ea7\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u4fe1\u53f7\u8fc7\u4e8e\u7c97\u7cd9\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bad\u7ec3\u505c\u6ede\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5", "method": "GTPO\u7b97\u6cd5\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u521b\u65b0\uff1a\u56de\u5408\u7ea7\u5956\u52b1\u5206\u914d\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u56de\u62a5\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u4f30\u8ba1\u3001\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5956\u52b1\u5851\u9020\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u4fe1\u53f7", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cGTPO\u6bd4GRPO\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u53473.0%\u7684\u6027\u80fd", "conclusion": "GTPO\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LLM\u5728\u590d\u6742\u591a\u56de\u5408\u5de5\u5177\u96c6\u6210\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4e3a\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u590d\u6742\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

Unlike algorithmic systems, which can deterministically execute long-horizon symbolic procedures, LLMs often degrade under extended reasoning chains, but there is no controlled, interpretable benchmark to isolate and measure this collapse. We introduce Finite-State Machine (FSM) Execution as a minimal, fully interpretable framework for evaluating the procedural reasoning capacity of LLMs. In our setup, the model is given an explicit FSM definition and must execute it step-by-step given input actions, maintaining state consistency over multiple turns. This task requires no world knowledge, only faithful application of deterministic transition rules, making it a direct probe of the model's internal procedural fidelity. We measure both Turn Accuracy and Task Accuracy to disentangle immediate computation from cumulative state maintenance. Empirical results reveal systematic degradation as task horizon or branching complexity increases. Models perform significantly worse when rule retrieval involves high branching factors than when memory span is long. Larger models show improved local accuracy but remain brittle under multi-step reasoning unless explicitly prompted to externalize intermediate steps. FSM-based evaluation offers a transparent, complexity-controlled probe for diagnosing this failure mode and guiding the design of inductive biases that enable genuine long-horizon procedural competence. By grounding reasoning in measurable execution fidelity rather than surface correctness, this work helps establish a rigorous experimental foundation for understanding and improving the algorithmic reliability of LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6709\u9650\u72b6\u6001\u673a\u6267\u884c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u7a0b\u5e8f\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u968f\u7740\u4efb\u52a1\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9ad8\u5206\u652f\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u5dee\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u9694\u79bb\u548c\u6d4b\u91cfLLM\u5728\u957f\u94fe\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u53ef\u63a7\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u7a0b\u5e8f\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6709\u9650\u72b6\u6001\u673a\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u3001\u5b8c\u5168\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8ba9\u6a21\u578b\u6839\u636e\u7ed9\u5b9a\u7684FSM\u5b9a\u4e49\u9010\u6b65\u6267\u884c\u8f93\u5165\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u72b6\u6001\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u968f\u4efb\u52a1\u8303\u56f4\u6216\u5206\u652f\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5728\u89c4\u5219\u68c0\u7d22\u6d89\u53ca\u9ad8\u5206\u652f\u56e0\u5b50\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "FSM\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e3a\u8bca\u65adLLM\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u900f\u660e\u3001\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u63a2\u9488\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5efa\u7acb\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u6539\u8fdbLLM\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

The problem, posed over a finite time horizon, is reformulated deterministically by expressing the cost functional in terms of a collection of second-moment matrices of the system state. A projection operator is introduced to restrict the analysis to the subspace of visited states, namely those with positive probability of being reached within the time horizon. The solution of the resulting deterministic problem is obtained from a reduced-order system of coupled matrix Riccati differential equations involving only the visited states, which define a quadratic value function satisfying a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman type equation. The structure of this equation is formally justified in the matrix setting via the Riesz-Frechet representation theorem, establishing a rigorous foundation for the deterministic reformulation and resolving an open aspect in previous literature. Several numerical examples, including cases with non-communicating states, validate the theoretical results and illustrate the practical relevance of the proposed generalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u7531\u4e00\u822c\u6709\u9650\u72b6\u6001\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u94fe\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u8df3\u8dc3\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u4e8c\u6b21\u8c03\u8282\u5668\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cd\u6784\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5305\u542b\u77ac\u6001\u3001\u5438\u6536\u6001\u6216\u975e\u901a\u4fe1\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfMJLS LQR\u95ee\u9898\u901a\u5e38\u5047\u8bbe\u6240\u6709\u72b6\u6001\u90fd\u662f\u904d\u5386\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u80fd\u5305\u542b\u77ac\u6001\u3001\u5438\u6536\u6001\u6216\u975e\u901a\u4fe1\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u4e00\u822c\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u5904\u7406\u8fd9\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u6295\u5f71\u7b97\u5b50\u5c06\u5206\u6790\u9650\u5236\u5728\u8bbf\u95ee\u72b6\u6001\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e8c\u9636\u77e9\u77e9\u9635\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cd\u6784\u6210\u672c\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u4ec5\u6d89\u53ca\u8bbf\u95ee\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u8026\u5408\u77e9\u9635Riccati\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eRiesz-Frechet\u8868\u793a\u5b9a\u7406\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u6570\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u7b97\u4f8b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u5904\u7406\u5305\u542b\u975e\u904d\u5386\u72b6\u6001\u7684MJLS LQR\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u4e14\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Thus, developing optimal takeoff trajectories for minimum energy consumption becomes essential for broader eVTOL aircraft applications. Conventional optimal control methods (such as dynamic programming and linear quadratic regulator) provide highly efficient and well-established solutions but are limited by problem dimensionality and complexity. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) emerges as a special type of artificial intelligence tackling complex, nonlinear systems; however, the training difficulty is a key bottleneck that limits DRL applications. To address these challenges, we propose the transformer-guided DRL to alleviate the training difficulty by exploring a realistic state space at each time step using a transformer. The proposed transformer-guided DRL was demonstrated on an optimal takeoff trajectory design of an eVTOL drone for minimal energy consumption while meeting takeoff conditions (i.e., minimum vertical displacement and minimum horizontal velocity) by varying control variables (i.e., power and wing angle to the vertical). Results presented that the transformer-guided DRL agent learned to take off with $4.57\\times10^6$ time steps, representing 25% of the $19.79\\times10^6$ time steps needed by a vanilla DRL agent. In addition, the transformer-guided DRL achieved 97.2% accuracy on the optimal energy consumption compared against the simulation-based optimal reference while the vanilla DRL achieved 96.3% accuracy. Therefore, the proposed transformer-guided DRL outperformed vanilla DRL in terms of both training efficiency as well as optimal design verification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u7535\u52a8\u5782\u76f4\u8d77\u964d\u98de\u673a\u7684\u8d77\u98de\u8f68\u8ff9\u4ee5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edfDRL\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u534775%\uff0c\u80fd\u8017\u4f18\u5316\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8fbe97.2%\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u95ee\u9898\u7ef4\u5ea6\u548c\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f46\u8bad\u7ec3\u56f0\u96be\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u4f18\u5316eVTOL\u98de\u673a\u7684\u8d77\u98de\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTransformer\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Transformer\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u63a2\u7d22\u73b0\u5b9e\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u529f\u7387\u548c\u673a\u7ffc\u89d2\u5ea6\u6765\u63a7\u5236eVTOL\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7684\u8d77\u98de\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "result": "Transformer\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684DRL\u4ec5\u9700457\u4e07\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u5b8c\u6210\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edfDRL\u76841979\u4e07\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u51cf\u5c1175%\u3002\u5728\u80fd\u8017\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u8fbe\u523097.2%\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfDRL\u768496.3%\u3002", "conclusion": "Transformer\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684DRL\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6700\u4f18\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfDRL\uff0c\u4e3aeVTOL\u98de\u673a\u80fd\u91cf\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

An advantage of DH systems is that they are always stable due to the structure of their coefficient matrices, and, under further weak conditions, even asymptotically stable. In this paper, we discuss the computation of the stability radii for a given asymptotically stable DH system; i.e., the smallest structured perturbation that puts a DH system on the boundary of the region of asymptotic stability, so that it has purely imaginary eigenvalues. We obtain explicit computable formulas for various structured stability radii. For this, the problem of computing stability radii is reformulated in terms of minimizing the Rayleigh quotient of a Hermitian matrix or the sum of two generalized Rayleigh quotients of Hermitian semidefinite matrices. This reformulation results in the problem of minimizing the largest eigenvalue of an eigenvector-dependent Hermitian matrix or minimizing the smallest eigenvalue of a Hermitian matrix which depends on the eigenvector. It is also demonstrated (via numerical experiments) that, under structure-preserving perturbations, the asymptotic stability of a DH system is much more robust than under general perturbations, since the distance to instability is typically much larger when structure-preserving perturbations are considered. Finally, similar results are obtained for optimally robust representations of stable systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u4e0d\u53d8\u8017\u6563\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u534a\u5f84\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u4fdd\u6301\u6270\u52a8\u4e0bDH\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6e10\u8fd1\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6bd4\u4e00\u822c\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u3002", "motivation": "DH\u7cfb\u7edf\u56e0\u5176\u7cfb\u6570\u77e9\u9635\u7ed3\u6784\u800c\u59cb\u7ec8\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5f31\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u6e10\u8fd1\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u534a\u5f84\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u534a\u5f84\u8ba1\u7b97\u95ee\u9898\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u6700\u5c0f\u5316Hermitian\u77e9\u9635\u7684Rayleigh\u5546\u6216\u4e24\u4e2a\u5e7f\u4e49Rayleigh\u5546\u4e4b\u548c\uff0c\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u5411\u91cf\u76f8\u5173Hermitian\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u6700\u5927\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u6216\u6700\u5c0f\u5316Hermitian\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u5404\u79cd\u7ed3\u6784\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u534a\u5f84\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u4fdd\u6301\u6270\u52a8\u4e0bDH\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6e10\u8fd1\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6bd4\u4e00\u822c\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\uff0c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u8ddd\u79bb\u901a\u5e38\u66f4\u5927\u3002", "conclusion": "DH\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u4fdd\u6301\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7ed3\u679c\u4e5f\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u7a33\u5b9a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u9c81\u68d2\u8868\u793a\u3002"}}

Accepted for publication at AIAS 2025", "summary": "We present Ask WhAI, a systems-level framework for inspecting and perturbing belief states in multi-agent interactions. The framework records and replays agent interactions, supports out-of-band queries into each agent's beliefs and rationale, and enables counterfactual evidence injection to test how belief structures respond to new information. We apply the framework to a medical case simulator notable for its multi-agent shared memory (a time-stamped electronic medical record, or EMR) and an oracle agent (the LabAgent) that holds ground truth lab results revealed only when explicitly queried. We stress-test the system on a multi-specialty diagnostic journey for a child with an abrupt-onset neuropsychiatric presentation. Large language model agents, each primed with strong role-specific priors (\"act like a neurologist\", \"act like an infectious disease specialist\"), write to a shared medical record and interact with a moderator across sequential or parallel encounters. Breakpoints at key diagnostic moments enable pre- and post-event belief queries, allowing us to distinguish entrenched priors from reasoning or evidence-integration effects. The simulation reveals that agent beliefs often mirror real-world disciplinary stances, including overreliance on canonical studies and resistance to counterevidence, and that these beliefs can be traced and interrogated in ways not possible with human experts. By making such dynamics visible and testable, Ask WhAI offers a reproducible way to study belief formation and epistemic silos in multi-agent scientific reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "Ask WhAI\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u67e5\u548c\u6270\u52a8\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u4fe1\u5ff5\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bb0\u5f55\u91cd\u653e\u4ea4\u4e92\u3001\u67e5\u8be2\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4fe1\u5ff5\u548c\u7406\u7531\u3001\u6ce8\u5165\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u636e\u6765\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4fe1\u5ff5\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u65b0\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u79d1\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u5ff5\u5f62\u6210\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u5b64\u5c9b\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u91cd\u73b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89c2\u5bdf\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8fd9\u4e9b\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\u4e2d\u662f\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u533b\u7597\u6848\u4f8b\u6a21\u62df\u5668\uff0c\u914d\u5907\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5171\u4eab\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff08\u65f6\u95f4\u6233\u7535\u5b50\u75c5\u5386\uff09\u548c\u6301\u6709\u771f\u5b9e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u9884\u8a00\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u3002\u8ba9\u5177\u6709\u7279\u5b9a\u89d2\u8272\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u987a\u5e8f\u6216\u5e76\u884c\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u5199\u5165\u5171\u4eab\u533b\u7597\u8bb0\u5f55\u5e76\u4e0e\u4e3b\u6301\u4eba\u4e92\u52a8\u3002", "result": "\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4fe1\u5ff5\u5f80\u5f80\u53cd\u6620\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5b66\u79d1\u7acb\u573a\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u5178\u578b\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u62b5\u5236\u53cd\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4fe1\u5ff5\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ee5\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u8fdb\u884c\u8ffd\u8e2a\u548c\u8d28\u8be2\u3002", "conclusion": "Ask WhAI\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u8fd9\u4e9b\u52a8\u6001\u53ef\u89c1\u548c\u53ef\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u79d1\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u5ff5\u5f62\u6210\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u5b64\u5c9b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u91cd\u73b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Federated learning (FL) offers a promising framework to conduct collaborative model training across satellite networks. Realizing its benefits in space naturally requires addressing space-specific constraints, from intermittent connectivity to dynamics imposed by orbital motion. This work presents the first systematic feasibility analysis of adapting off-the-shelf FL algorithms for satellite constellation deployment. We introduce a comprehensive \"space-ification\" framework that adapts terrestrial algorithms (FedAvg, FedProx, FedBuff) to operate under orbital constraints, producing an orbital-ready suite of FL algorithms. We then evaluate these space-ified methods through extensive parameter sweeps across 768 constellation configurations that vary cluster sizes (1-10), satellites per cluster (1-10), and ground station networks (1-13). Our analysis demonstrates that space-adapted FL algorithms efficiently scale to constellations of up to 100 satellites, achieving performance close to the centralized ideal. Multi-month training cycles can be reduced to days, corresponding to a 9x speedup through orbital scheduling and local coordination within satellite clusters. These results provide actionable insights for future mission designers, enabling distributed on-board learning for more autonomous, resilient, and data-driven satellite operations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5728\u536b\u661f\u661f\u5ea7\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5c06\u5730\u9762FL\u7b97\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u592a\u7a7a\u73af\u5883\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u5728768\u79cd\u661f\u5ea7\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u592a\u7a7a\u9002\u5e94FL\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5230100\u9897\u536b\u661f\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u7406\u60f3\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u5468\u671f\u53ef\u4ece\u6570\u6708\u7f29\u77ed\u81f3\u6570\u5929\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u4f4e\u5730\u7403\u8f68\u9053\u536b\u661f\u661f\u5ea7\u89c4\u6a21\u8fc5\u901f\u6269\u5927\u81f3\u6570\u767e\u4e0a\u5343\u9897\uff0c\u4e0b\u884c\u5e26\u5bbd\u9650\u5236\u4f7f\u5f97\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u661f\u8f7d\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u53d8\u5f97\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e3a\u536b\u661f\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u592a\u7a7a\u7279\u6709\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u7684\"\u592a\u7a7a\u5316\"\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5730\u9762FL\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08FedAvg\u3001FedProx\u3001FedBuff\uff09\u9002\u5e94\u8f68\u9053\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u8f68\u9053\u5c31\u7eea\u7684FL\u7b97\u6cd5\u5957\u4ef6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7768\u79cd\u661f\u5ea7\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u53c2\u6570\u626b\u63cf\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u96c6\u7fa4\u5927\u5c0f\u3001\u6bcf\u96c6\u7fa4\u536b\u661f\u6570\u548c\u5730\u9762\u7ad9\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u592a\u7a7a\u9002\u5e94\u7684FL\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u6269\u5c55\u5230100\u9897\u536b\u661f\u7684\u661f\u5ea7\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u7406\u60f3\u60c5\u51b5\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8f68\u9053\u8c03\u5ea6\u548c\u536b\u661f\u96c6\u7fa4\u5185\u7684\u672c\u5730\u534f\u8c03\uff0c\u591a\u6708\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u5468\u671f\u53ef\u7f29\u77ed\u81f3\u6570\u5929\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b09\u500d\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u4efb\u52a1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u4f7f\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u661f\u8f7d\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u81ea\u4e3b\u3001\u5f39\u6027\u548c\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u536b\u661f\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002"}}

Our approach ensures that all system trajectories remain within a specified admissible set and converge to equilibrium in a predefined time despite adversarial disturbances. The control problem is formulated as a two-player zero-sum differential game, where the controller is a minimizing player and the adversary a maximizing player. We derive sufficient conditions for the existence of a saddle-point solution and safe predefined-time stability using a barrier Lyapunov function that satisfies a differential inequality and the steady-state Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) equation. To address the analytical intractability of solving the HJI equation, we introduce a physics-informed learning algorithm that robustly learns the Nash safely predefined-time stabilizing control strategy.

Disaster databases such as EM-DAT often report locations in unstructured textual form, with inconsistent granularity or spelling, that make it difficult to integrate with spatial datasets. We present a fully automated LLM-assisted workflow that processes and cleans textual location information using GPT-4o, and assigns geometries by cross-checking three independent geoinformation repositories: GADM, OpenStreetMap and Wikidata. Based on the agreement and availability of these sources, we assign a reliability score to each location while generating subnational geometries.

The ability to call external tools further expands their capability to handle real-world tasks. However, LLMs often follow an opaque reasoning process, which limits their usefulness in high-stakes domains where solutions need to be trustworthy to end users. LLMs can choose solutions that are unreliable and difficult to troubleshoot, even if better options are available. We address this issue by forcing LLMs to use external -- more reliable -- tools to solve problems when possible. We present a framework built on the tool-calling capabilities of existing LLMs to enable them to select the most reliable and easy-to-troubleshoot solution path, which may involve multiple sequential tool calls. We refer to this framework as LIT (LLMs with Inspectable Tools). In order to support LIT, we introduce a new and challenging benchmark dataset of 1,300 questions and a customizable set of reliability cost functions associated with a collection of specialized tools. These cost functions summarize how reliable each tool is and how easy it is to troubleshoot. For instance, a calculator is reliable across domains, whereas a linear prediction model is not reliable if there is distribution shift, but it is easy to troubleshoot. A tool that constructs a random forest is neither reliable nor easy to troubleshoot. These tools interact with the Harvard USPTO Patent Dataset and a new dataset of NeurIPS 2023 papers to solve mathematical, coding, and modeling problems of varying difficulty levels. We demonstrate that LLMs can achieve more reliable and informed problem-solving while maintaining task performance using our framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86LIT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5236LLM\u4f7f\u7528\u5916\u90e8\u53ef\u9760\u5de5\u5177\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u8c03\u8bd5\u6027", "motivation": "LLM\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u9886\u57df\u96be\u4ee5\u4fe1\u4efb\uff0c\u4e14\u53ef\u80fd\u9009\u62e9\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709LLM\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u6784\u5efa\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8ba9LLM\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u6613\u4e8e\u8c03\u8bd5\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u6d89\u53ca\u591a\u4e2a\u987a\u5e8f\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528", "result": "LLM\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u548c\u660e\u667a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd", "conclusion": "LIT\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5236\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u9760\u5de5\u5177\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LLM\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u8c03\u8bd5\u6027"}}

In particular, two function classes -- \\textit{weakly self-concordant} functions and \\textit{$F$-based self-concordant} functions -- generalize the self-concordant framework beyond convexity, without assuming the Lipschitz continuity of the gradient or Hessian. For these function classes, we propose a regularized Newton method and an adaptive regularization method that achieve an $\u03b5$-approximate first-order stationary point in $O(\u03b5^{-2})$ iterations. Equipped with an oracle capable of detecting negative curvature, the adaptive algorithm can further attain convergence to an approximate second-order stationary point.

Applications to medical signal retrieval and activity recognition. Correspondence: m.shi16@imperial.ac.uk", "summary": "Neural networks exhibit severe brittleness to semantically irrelevant transformations. A mere 75ms electrocardiogram (ECG) phase shift degrades latent cosine similarity from 1.0 to 0.2, while sensor rotations collapse activity recognition performance with inertial measurement units (IMUs). We identify the root cause as \"laissez-faire\" representation learning, where latent spaces evolve unconstrained provided task performance is satisfied. We propose Structured Contrastive Learning (SCL), a framework that partitions latent space representations into three semantic groups: invariant features that remain consistent under given transformations (e.g., phase shifts or rotations), variant features that actively differentiate transformations via a novel variant mechanism, and free features that preserve task flexibility. This creates controllable push-pull dynamics where different latent dimensions serve distinct, interpretable purposes. The variant mechanism enhances contrastive learning by encouraging variant features to differentiate within positive pairs, enabling simultaneous robustness and interpretability. Our approach requires no architectural modifications and integrates seamlessly into existing training pipelines. Experiments on ECG phase invariance and IMU rotation robustness demonstrate superior performance: ECG similarity improves from 0.25 to 0.91 under phase shifts, while WISDM activity recognition achieves 86.65% accuracy with 95.38% rotation consistency, consistently outperforming traditional data augmentation.

Without prior knowledge of the system model parameters, an adaptive and direct learning rule for the cost parameter is proposed using online off-policy system data, which only needs to satisfy the mild persistently exciting condition in the general data-driven paradigm. The adaptive and online IRL algorithm is achieved by designing full Nesterov-Todd (NT)-step primal-dual interior-point iterations. Despite solving a nonlinear and time-varying semi-definite program (SDP), the influence of system noise is rigorously analyzed, and the proposed online algorithm is shown to achieve a sublinear convergence. The proposed method is further generalized to nonlinear IRL based on differential dynamic programming. The gradient of the loss function is directly obtained via a backward pass, which eliminates the need to repeatedly solve forward RL problems as in conventional bi-level IRL frameworks. Finally, the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithms are demonstrated by numerical examples.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u79bb\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9006\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7NT\u6b65\u539f\u59cb\u5bf9\u5076\u5185\u70b9\u6cd5\u8fed\u4ee3\u6c42\u89e3\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u53d8\u534a\u5b9a\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u7cfb\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u6210\u672c\u51fd\u6570\u5728\u7ebf\u91cd\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u9006\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u7cfb\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u79bb\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\u6570\u636e\u5728\u7ebf\u91cd\u6784\u672a\u77e5\u6210\u672c\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b8c\u5168\u79bb\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u81ea\u9002\u5e94IRL\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5168NT\u6b65\u539f\u59cb\u5bf9\u5076\u5185\u70b9\u6cd5\u8fed\u4ee3\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5728\u7ebfIRL\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u975e\u7ebf\u6027IRL\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5fae\u5206\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u76f4\u63a5\u83b7\u53d6\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4f20\u7edf\u53cc\u5c42IRL\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u91cd\u590d\u6c42\u89e3\u524d\u5411RL\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u4ec5\u6ee1\u8db3\u6e29\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u6fc0\u52b1\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u6b21\u7ebf\u6027\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u566a\u58f0\u5f71\u54cd\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u4e25\u683c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5728\u7ebfIRL\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u65e0\u6a21\u578b\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u79bb\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u6709\u6548\u91cd\u6784\u6210\u672c\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u9006\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Among these properties, this paper focuses on representativeness-the extent to which the scenario-based data used for training and testing, reflect the operational conditions that the system is designed to operate safely in, i.e., Operational Design Domain (ODD) or expected to encounter, i.e., Target Operational Domain (TOD). We propose a probabilistic method that quantifies representativeness by comparing the statistical distribution of features encoded by the scenario suites with the corresponding distribution of features representing the TOD, acknowledging that the true TOD distribution is unknown, as it can only be inferred from limited data.\n  We apply an imprecise Bayesian method to handle limited data and uncertain priors. The imprecise Bayesian formulation produces interval-valued, uncertainty-aware estimates of representativeness, rather than a single value. We present a numerical example comparing the distributions of the scenario suite and the inferred TOD across operational categories-weather, road type, time of day, etc., under dependencies and prior uncertainty. We estimate representativeness locally (between categories) and globally as an interval.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u6982\u7387\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u91cf\u5316AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u573a\u666f\u5957\u4ef6\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u64cd\u4f5c\u57df\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u7cbe\u786e\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u65b9\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u6709\u9650\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5148\u9a8c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u533a\u95f4\u503c\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "motivation": "\u786e\u4fddAI\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u5982\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6c7d\u8f66\uff09\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u5173\u952e\u5728\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u6570\u636e\u76f8\u5173\u5b89\u5168\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u2014\u2014\u5373\u573a\u666f\u6570\u636e\u53cd\u6620\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b89\u5168\u64cd\u4f5c\u6761\u4ef6\u6216\u9884\u671f\u9047\u5230\u64cd\u4f5c\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6982\u7387\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4\u8f83\u573a\u666f\u5957\u4ef6\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u64cd\u4f5c\u57df\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e0d\u7cbe\u786e\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u65b9\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u6709\u9650\u6570\u636e\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u533a\u95f4\u503c\u3001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u793a\u4f8b\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u548c\u5148\u9a8c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u8de8\u64cd\u4f5c\u7c7b\u522b\uff08\u5929\u6c14\u3001\u9053\u8def\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u7b49\uff09\u7684\u573a\u666f\u5957\u4ef6\u4e0e\u63a8\u65ad\u76ee\u6807\u64cd\u4f5c\u57df\u5206\u5e03\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u5c40\u90e8\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u533a\u95f4\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u91cf\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u533a\u95f4\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5145\u5206\u6027\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002"}}

We present Causal-GCN, an interventional graph convolutional framework that integrates do-calculus-based back-door adjustment to identify brain regions exerting stable causal influence on AD progression. Each subject's MRI is represented as a structural connectome where nodes denote cortical and subcortical regions and edges encode anatomical connectivity. Confounders such as age, sec, and APOE4 genotype are summarized via principal components and included in the causal adjustment set. After training, interventions on individual regions are simulated by serving their incoming edges and altering node features to estimate average causal effects on disease probability.

We establish the characterization of the mean-field equilibrium (MFE) in MFG with two populations as well as the Nash equilibrium in the $N_1+N_2$-player game. Furthermore, we prove the convergence of the Nash equilibrium in the $N_1+N_2$-player game to the MFE as the number of players in two populations tends to infinity.

While deep reinforcement learning (DRL) models show promise in optimizing network resources, they often struggle with robustness and generalizability in dynamic environments. This paper introduces a novel resource management approach that enhances the Soft Actor Critic (SAC) algorithm with Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) in a distributed Multi-Agent RL (MARL) framework. Our method introduces an adaptive and selective SAM mechanism, where regularization is explicitly driven by temporal-difference (TD)-error variance, ensuring that only agents facing high environmental complexity are regularized. This targeted strategy reduces unnecessary overhead, improves training stability, and enhances generalization without sacrificing learning efficiency. We further incorporate a dynamic $\u03c1$ scheduling scheme to refine the exploration-exploitation trade-off across agents.

Accepted to the Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning Workshop at EurIPS 2025", "summary": "Large language models trained on clinical text risk exposing sensitive patient information, yet differential privacy (DP) methods often severely degrade the diagnostic accuracy needed for deployment. Despite rapid progress in DP optimisation and text generation, it remains unclear which privacy-preserving strategy actually works best for clinical language tasks. We present the first systematic head-to-head comparison of four training pipelines for automated diagnostic coding from hospital discharge summaries.

Although reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved superhuman performance in many domains, relatively little attention has been focused on designing human-like RL agents. As a result, many reward-driven RL agents often exhibit unnatural behaviors compared to humans, raising concerns for both interpretability and trustworthiness. To achieve human-like behavior in RL, this paper first formulates human-likeness as trajectory optimization, where the objective is to find an action sequence that closely aligns with human behavior while also maximizing rewards, and adapts the classic receding-horizon control to human-like learning as a tractable and efficient implementation. To achieve this, we introduce Macro Action Quantization (MAQ), a human-like RL framework that distills human demonstrations into macro actions via Vector-Quantized VAE. Experiments on D4RL Adroit benchmarks show that MAQ significantly improves human-likeness, increasing trajectory similarity scores, and achieving the highest human-likeness rankings among all RL agents in the human evaluation study. Our results also demonstrate that MAQ can be easily integrated into various off-the-shelf RL algorithms, opening a promising direction for learning human-like RL agents.

To address the first challenge, we propose the Greedy Mini-Extragradient (Mini-EG) method, which updates only the coordinate associated with the dominant component of the mapping at each extragradient step. This design capitalizes on componentwise Lipschitz constants that are far easier to estimate than the classical global Lipschitz constant. To further lower computational cost, we introduce a Random Mini-EG variant that replaces full mapping evaluations by sampling only a single coordinate per extragradient step. Although this resolves the second challenge from a theoretical standpoint, its practical efficiency remains limited. To bridge this gap, we develop the Watchdog-Max strategy, motivated by the slow decay of dominant component magnitudes. Instead of evaluating the full mapping, Watchdog-Max identifies and tracks only two coordinates at each extragradient step, dramatically reducing per-iteration cost while retaining strong practical performance.

GeneGPT addressed this challenge by combining domain-specific APIs with OpenAI's code-davinci-002 large language model to enable natural language interaction with genomic databases. However, its reliance on a proprietary model limits scalability, increases operational costs, and raises concerns about data privacy and generalization.\n  In this work, we revisit and reproduce GeneGPT in a pilot study using open source models, including Llama 3.1, Qwen2.5, and Qwen2.5 Coder, within a monolithic architecture; this allows us to identify the limitations of this approach. Building on this foundation, we then develop OpenBioLLM, a modular multi-agent framework that extends GeneGPT by introducing agent specialization for tool routing, query generation, and response validation. This enables coordinated reasoning and role-based task execution.\n  OpenBioLLM matches or outperforms GeneGPT on over 90% of the benchmark tasks, achieving average scores of 0.849 on Gene-Turing and 0.830 on GeneHop, while using smaller open-source models without additional fine-tuning or tool-specific pretraining. OpenBioLLM's modular multi-agent design reduces latency by 40-50% across benchmark tasks, significantly improving efficiency without compromising model capability. The results of our comprehensive evaluation highlight the potential of open-source multi-agent systems for genomic question answering.

Each segment is designed to enforce specific desirable properties of the estimator such as rapidity, desired condition number of the information matrix, accuracy, numerical stability, etc. The forgetting profile is divided in three segments, where the speed of estimation is ensured by the first segment, which employs rapid exponential forgetting of recent data.The second segment features a decline in the profile and marks the transition to the third segment, characterized by slow exponential forgetting to reduce the condition number of the information matrix using more distant data. Condition number reduction mitigates error propagation, thereby enhancing accuracy and stability. This approach facilitates the incorporation of a priori information regarding signal characteristics (i.e., the expected behavior of the signal) into the estimator. Recursive and computationally efficient algorithm with low rank updates based on new matrix inversion lemma for moving window associated with this regularization approach is developed.

Moreover, the education problem is inherently difficult because the learning process is only partially observable. We therefore develop a dynamic, time-series environment to simulate a classroom setting, with student-teacher interventions - including tutoring sessions, lectures, and exams. In particular, we design the simulated environment to allow for varying levels of probing interventions that can gather more information. Then, we develop reinforcement learning ITSs that combine learning the individual state of students while pulling from population information through the use of probing interventions. These interventions can reduce the difficulty of student estimation, but also introduce a cost-benefit decision to find a balance between probing enough to get accurate estimates and probing so often that it becomes disruptive to the student. We compare the efficacy of standard RL algorithms with several greedy rules-based heuristic approaches to find that they provide different solutions, but with similar results. We also highlight the difficulty of the problem with increasing levels of hidden information, and the boost that we get if we allow for probing interventions. We show the flexibility of both heuristic and RL policies with regards to changing student population distributions, finding that both are flexible, but RL policies struggle to help harder classes. Finally, we test different course structures with non-probing policies and we find that our policies are able to boost the performance of quiz and midterm structures more than we can in a finals-only structure, highlighting the benefit of having additional information.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u62df\u6559\u5ba4\u73af\u5883\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u667a\u80fd\u8f85\u5bfc\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a2\u6d4b\u6027\u5e72\u9884\u6765\u5e73\u8861\u5b66\u751f\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u6559\u5b66\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86RL\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0e\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u667a\u80fd\u8f85\u5bfc\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u8981\u5904\u7406\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5b66\u751f\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u53ea\u80fd\u90e8\u5206\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u7ed3\u5408\u4e2a\u4f53\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u7fa4\u4f53\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6559\u5b66\u73af\u5883\u3002", "method": "\u521b\u5efa\u6a21\u62df\u6559\u5ba4\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63a2\u6d4b\u6027\u5e72\u9884\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u7ed3\u5408\u4e2a\u4f53\u72b6\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u7fa4\u4f53\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60ITS\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "RL\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e0d\u540c\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u4f46\u6548\u679c\u76f8\u4f3c\uff1b\u63a2\u6d4b\u6027\u5e72\u9884\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u9690\u85cf\u4fe1\u606f\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u5b66\u751f\u7fa4\u4f53\u5206\u5e03\u90fd\u6709\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u4f46RL\u5728\u56f0\u96be\u73ed\u7ea7\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u5dee\uff1b\u5728\u6d4b\u9a8c\u548c\u671f\u4e2d\u8003\u8bd5\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u6bd4\u671f\u672b\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63a2\u6d4b\u6027\u5e72\u9884\u5728\u667a\u80fd\u8f85\u5bfc\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5e73\u8861\u4fe1\u606f\u83b7\u53d6\u548c\u6559\u5b66\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u6839\u636e\u5177\u4f53\u8bfe\u7a0b\u7ed3\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5408\u9002\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in automating feature extraction (AutoFE), existing methods are often limited by monolithic LLM architectures, simplistic quantitative feedback, and a failure to systematically integrate external domain knowledge. This paper introduces Rogue One, a novel, LLM-based multi-agent framework for knowledge-informed automatic feature extraction. Rogue One operationalizes a decentralized system of three specialized agents-Scientist, Extractor, and Tester-that collaborate iteratively to discover, generate, and validate predictive features. Crucially, the framework moves beyond primitive accuracy scores by introducing a rich, qualitative feedback mechanism and a \"flooding-pruning\" strategy, allowing it to dynamically balance feature exploration and exploitation. By actively incorporating external knowledge via an integrated retrieval-augmented (RAG) system, Rogue One generates features that are not only statistically powerful but also semantically meaningful and interpretable. We demonstrate that Rogue One significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on a comprehensive suite of 19 classification and 9 regression datasets. Furthermore, we show qualitatively that the system surfaces novel, testable hypotheses, such as identifying a new potential biomarker in the myocardial dataset, underscoring its utility as a tool for scientific discovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "Rogue One\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e13\u4e1a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff08\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u3001\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\u3001\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5668\uff09\u534f\u4f5c\u8fdb\u884c\u77e5\u8bc6\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709AutoFE\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00LLM\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u7b80\u5355\u91cf\u5316\u53cd\u9988\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5916\u90e8\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5de5\u7a0b\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u7684\u4e09\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff1a\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u53d1\u73b0\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\u751f\u6210\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5668\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u4e30\u5bcc\u5b9a\u6027\u53cd\u9988\u673a\u5236\u3001\"\u6cdb\u6ee5-\u4fee\u526a\"\u7b56\u7565\u548cRAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u96c6\u6210\u5916\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "result": "\u572819\u4e2a\u5206\u7c7b\u548c9\u4e2a\u56de\u5f52\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u53d1\u73b0\u65b0\u9896\u53ef\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5047\u8bbe\uff08\u5982\u5fc3\u808c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u65b0\u751f\u7269\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "Rogue One\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u4f9b\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e0a\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u8fd8\u751f\u6210\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0a\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

It is highly infectious and has the following symptoms: fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, the new loss of taste or smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea or vomiting, and diarrhea. These symptoms vary in severity; some people with many risk factors have been known to have lengthy hospital stays or die from the disease. In this paper, we analyze patients' electronic health records (EHR) to predict the severity of their COVID-19 infection using the length of stay (LOS) as our measurement of severity.

In this work, we study Neumann boundary and distributed control problems for tracking a prescribed pressure field governed by the Westervelt equation with time-fractional dissipation. This model captures nonlinear ultrasonic wave propagation in biological media and accounts for the experimentally observed power-law attenuation. We begin by extending the existing well-posedness theory for time-fractional equations to include inhomogeneous Neumann boundary data used as control inputs, which requires constructing an appropriate data extension and regularization. Using these analytical results for the forward problem, we prove the existence of globally optimal controls and analyze the stability of the optimization problem with respect to perturbations in the target pressure field and to vanishing regularization parameters.

In this paper, we present SafeRBench, the first benchmark that assesses LRM safety end-to-end -- from inputs and intermediate reasoning to final outputs. (1) Input Characterization: We pioneer the incorporation of risk categories and levels into input design, explicitly accounting for affected groups and severity, and thereby establish a balanced prompt suite reflecting diverse harm gradients. (2) Fine-Grained Output Analysis: We introduce a micro-thought chunking mechanism to segment long reasoning traces into semantically coherent units, enabling fine-grained evaluation across ten safety dimensions.

However, forming a CDSS for the arrhythmia classification task is challenging due to the varying lengths of arrhythmias. Although the onset time of arrhythmia varies, previously developed methods have not considered such conditions. Thus, we propose a framework that consists of (i) local and global extraction and (ii) local-global information fusion with attention to enable arrhythmia detection and classification within a constrained input length. The framework's performance was evaluated in terms of 10-class and 4-class arrhythmia detection, focusing on identifying the onset and ending point of arrhythmia episodes and their duration using the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database (MITDB) and the MIT-BIH atrial fibrillation database (AFDB). Duration, episode, and Dice score performances resulted in overall F1-scores of 96.45%, 82.05%, and 96.31% on the MITDB and 97.57%, 98.31%, and 97.45% on the AFDB, respectively. The results demonstrated statistically superior performance compared to those of the benchmark models. To assess the generalization capability of the proposed method, an MITDB-trained model and MIT-BIH malignant ventricular arrhythmia database-trained model were tested AFDB and MITDB, respectively. Superior performance was attained compared with that of a state-of-the-art model. The proposed method effectively captures both local and global information and dynamics without significant information loss.

Existing methods based on heterogeneous information networks (HINs) are prone to introducing noises due to manual or random selection of meta-paths and lack necessary quality assessment of meta-path instances. Conversely, recent large language models (LLMs)-based methods ignore the rich information across students, and both paradigms struggle to deliver consistently accurate and evidence-based explanations. To address these issues, we propose an innovative framework, HIN-LLM Synergistic Enhanced Knowledge Tracing (HISE-KT), which seamlessly integrates HINs with LLMs. HISE-KT first builds a multi-relationship HIN containing diverse node types to capture the structural relations through multiple meta-paths. The LLM is then employed to intelligently score and filter meta-path instances and retain high-quality paths, pioneering automated meta-path quality assessment. Inspired by educational psychology principles, a similar student retrieval mechanism based on meta-paths is designed to provide a more valuable context for prediction. Finally, HISE-KT uses a structured prompt to integrate the target student's history with the retrieved similar trajectories, enabling the LLM to generate not only accurate predictions but also evidence-backed, explainable analysis reports.

The conventional TNM staging system is inadequate for personalized medicine. We aimed to develop and validate a novel multiple instance learning model TDAM-CRC using histopathological whole-slide images for accurate prognostic prediction and to uncover its underlying molecular mechanisms. We trained the model on the TCGA discovery cohort (n=581), validated it in an independent external cohort (n=1031), and further we integrated multi-omics data to improve model interpretability and identify novel prognostic biomarkers. The results demonstrated that the TDAM-CRC achieved robust risk stratification in both cohorts. Its predictive performance significantly outperformed the conventional clinical staging system and multiple state-of-the-art models. The TDAM-CRC risk score was confirmed as an independent prognostic factor in multivariable analysis. Multi-omics analysis revealed that the high-risk subtype is closely associated with metabolic reprogramming and an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Through interaction network analysis, we identified and validated Mitochondrial Ribosomal Protein L37 (MRPL37) as a key hub gene linking deep pathomic features to clinical prognosis. We found that high expression of MRPL37, driven by promoter hypomethylation, serves as an independent biomarker of favorable prognosis. Finally, we constructed a nomogram incorporating the TDAM-CRC risk score and clinical factors to provide a precise and interpretable clinical decision-making tool for CRC patients.

In the existing literature, existence is typically established using Schauder's fixed-point theorem, relying on the equicontinuity of players' best response functions.

Our method turns LLM overconfidence from a limitation into an asset by capturing uncertainty patterns that reliably distinguish between ``seen\" (training data) and ``unseen\" (non-training data) content. COPYCHECK further implements a two-fold strategy: (1) strategic segmentation of files into smaller snippets to reduce dependence on large-scale training data, and (2) uncertainty-guided unsupervised clustering to eliminate the need for empirically tuned thresholds. Experiment results show that COPYCHECK achieves an average balanced accuracy of 90.1% on LLaMA 7b and 91.6% on LLaMA2 7b in detecting seen files. Compared to the SOTA baseline, COPYCHECK achieves over 90% relative improvement, reaching up to 93.8\\% balanced accuracy.

Through an analysis of current debates in AI research, we demonstrate how the conceptions remain largely implicit yet fundamentally shape how empirical evidence gets interpreted across a wide range of areas. These underlying views generate fundamentally different research approaches across three areas. Methodologically, they produce different approaches to model selection, benchmark design, and experimental validation. Interpretively, they lead to contradictory readings of the same empirical phenomena, from capability emergence to system limitations. Regarding AI risk, they generate categorically different assessments: realists view superintelligence as the primary risk and search for unified alignment solutions, while pluralists see diverse threats across different domains requiring context-specific solutions.

Consequently, they struggle to adapt to dynamically changing capability requirements in real-world tasks. Meanwhile, humans exhibit a complementary set of thinking abilities when addressing such tasks, whereas existing methods typically cover only a subset of these dimensions. Inspired by this, we propose Octopus: Agentic Multimodal Reasoning with Six-Capability Orchestration, a new paradigm for multimodal agentic reasoning. We define six core capabilities essential for multimodal reasoning and organize a comprehensive evaluation benchmark, Octopus-Bench, accordingly. Octopus is capable of autonomously exploring during reasoning and dynamically selecting the most appropriate capability based on the current state.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are easily corrupted by artifacts and individual variability, while emotional labels often stem from subjective and inconsistent reports-making robust affective decoding particularly difficult. We propose an uncertainty-aware active learning framework that enhances robustness to label noise by jointly leveraging model uncertainty and cross-modal consistency. Instead of relying solely on EEG-based uncertainty estimates, the method evaluates cross-modal alignment to determine whether uncertainty originates from cognitive ambiguity or sensor noise. A representation alignment module embeds EEG and face features into a shared latent space, enforcing semantic coherence between modalities. Residual discrepancies are treated as noise-induced inconsistencies, and these samples are selectively queried for oracle feedback during active learning. This feedback-driven process guides the network toward reliable, informative samples and reduces the impact of noisy labels.

Pretrained on 1,000+ games, our IPR performs robustly on three levels, matches GPT-5 overall, and surpasses it on Curiosity.

Existing methods lack deep semantic insight. To address this, we propose the Transaction Intent Mining (TIM) framework. TIM leverages a DeFi intent taxonomy built on grounded theory and a multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) system to robustly infer user intents. A Meta-Level Planner dynamically coordinates domain experts to decompose multiple perspective-specific intent analyses into solvable subtasks.

However, the scarcity of fault data, due to the rarity of fault events and the high cost of data annotation, significantly hinders data-driven approaches. Existing time-series generation models, optimized for abundant normal data, struggle to capture fault distributions in few-shot scenarios, producing samples that lack authenticity and diversity due to the large domain gap and high intra-class variability of faults. To address this, we propose a novel few-shot fault time-series generation framework based on diffusion models. Our approach employs a positive-negative difference adapter, leveraging pre-trained normal data distributions to model the discrepancies between normal and fault domains for accurate fault synthesis. Additionally, a diversity loss is introduced to prevent mode collapse, encouraging the generation of diverse fault samples through inter-sample difference regularization. Experimental results demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms traditional methods in authenticity and diversity, achieving state-of-the-art performance on key benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u6545\u969c\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6b63\u8d1f\u5dee\u5f02\u9002\u914d\u5668\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u635f\u5931\u89e3\u51b3\u6545\u969c\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5de5\u4e1a\u8bbe\u5907\u76d1\u6d4b\u4e2d\u6545\u969c\u8bca\u65ad\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u6545\u969c\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\uff08\u7531\u4e8e\u6545\u969c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7f55\u89c1\u548c\u6570\u636e\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff09\u4e25\u91cd\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u6545\u969c\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6837\u672c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u6545\u969c\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6b63\u8d1f\u5dee\u5f02\u9002\u914d\u5668\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6b63\u5e38\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u6765\u5efa\u6a21\u6b63\u5e38\u4e0e\u6545\u969c\u57df\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u6545\u969c\u5408\u6210\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u6837\u6027\u635f\u5931\u9632\u6b62\u6a21\u5f0f\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6837\u672c\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u9f13\u52b1\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6545\u969c\u6837\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u5173\u952e\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u6545\u969c\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6545\u969c\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u771f\u5b9e\u4e14\u591a\u6837\u7684\u6545\u969c\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u4e3a\u5de5\u4e1a\u8bbe\u5907\u6545\u969c\u8bca\u65ad\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has shown promise, yet classical models rely on large multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) that are parameter-heavy and memory-bound. We propose a Quantum Graph Attention Network (Q-GAT) within a DRL framework, where parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) replace conventional MLPs at critical readout stages. The hybrid model maintains the expressive capacity of graph attention encoders while reducing trainable parameters by more than 50%. Using proximal policy optimization (PPO) with greedy and stochastic decoding, experiments on VRP benchmarks show that Q-GAT achieves faster convergence and reduces routing cost by about 5% compared with classical GAT baselines.

Studying the Role of Ideation Diversity", "comment": null, "summary": "AI research agents offer the promise to accelerate scientific progress by automating the design, implementation, and training of machine learning models. However, the field is still in its infancy, and the key factors driving the success or failure of agent trajectories are not fully understood. We examine the role that ideation diversity plays in agent performance. First, we analyse agent trajectories on MLE-bench, a well-known benchmark to evaluate AI research agents, across different models and agent scaffolds.

However, vanilla MAR suffers from slow inference due to its hierarchical inference mechanism: an outer AR unmasking loop and an inner diffusion denoising chain. Such decoupled structure not only harm the generation efficiency but also hinder the practical use of MAR for reinforcement learning (RL), an increasingly critical paradigm for generative model post-training.To address this fundamental issue, we introduce MARVAL (Masked Auto-regressive Variational Acceleration), a distillation-based framework that compresses the diffusion chain into a single AR generation step while preserving the flexible auto-regressive unmasking order. Such a distillation with MARVAL not only yields substantial inference acceleration but, crucially, makes RL post-training with verifiable rewards practical, resulting in scalable yet human-preferred fast generative models. Our contributions are twofold: (1) a novel score-based variational objective for distilling masked auto-regressive diffusion models into a single generation step without sacrificing sample quality; and (2) an efficient RL framework for masked auto-regressive models via MARVAL-RL. On ImageNet 256*256, MARVAL-Huge achieves an FID of 2.00 with more than 30 times speedup compared with MAR-diffusion, and MARVAL-RL yields consistent improvements in CLIP and image-reward scores on ImageNet datasets with entity names.

We challenge this assumption by analyzing trajectories with several step-level metrics: entropy-based uncertainty, Confidence-Margin (CM) uncertainty, and Rate of Entropy Change (RoEC). These reveal structured \"zones of confusion\": transient spikes in uncertainty and instability that strongly predict final success or failure, while most steps remain stable.

Entropy is crucial in this context, as it controls exploration and helps avoid premature convergence to sub-optimal solutions. However, existing reinforcement learning methods struggle to maintain an appropriate level of entropy, as the training process involves a mix of positive and negative samples, each affecting entropy in different ways across steps. To address this, we propose Entropy stablilization via Proportional-Integral Control (EntroPIC), a novel method that adaptively adjusts the influence of positive and negative samples by dynamically tuning their loss coefficients.

Addressing this challenge, this study proposes an intelligent scheduling method based on the improved Dual-Delay Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (PVTD3) algorithm. System optimization is achieved by introducing a penalty term for grid power purchase variations. Simulation results demonstrate that under three typical scenarios (10%, 20%, and 30% renewable penetration), the PVTD3 algorithm reduces the system's comprehensive cost by 6.93%, 12.68%, and 13.59% respectively compared to the traditional TD3 algorithm. Concurrently, it reduces the average fluctuation amplitude of grid power purchases by 12.8%. Regarding energy storage management, the PVTD3 algorithm reduces the end-time state values of low-temperature thermal storage tanks by 7.67-17.67 units while maintaining high-temperature tanks within the 3.59-4.25 safety operating range.

However, existing methods rely on frequent adaptation and high computational cost, making them unsuitable for resource-constrained edge environments. To address this, we propose SNAP, a sparse TTA framework that reduces adaptation frequency and data usage while preserving accuracy. SNAP maintains competitive accuracy even when adapting based on only 1% of the incoming data stream, demonstrating its robustness under infrequent updates. Our method introduces two key components: (i) Class and Domain Representative Memory (CnDRM), which identifies and stores a small set of samples that are representative of both class and domain characteristics to support efficient adaptation with limited data; and (ii) Inference-only Batch-aware Memory Normalization (IoBMN), which dynamically adjusts normalization statistics at inference time by leveraging these representative samples, enabling efficient alignment to shifting target domains. Integrated with five state-of-the-art TTA algorithms, SNAP reduces latency by up to 93.12%, while keeping the accuracy drop below 3.3%, even across adaptation rates ranging from 1% to 50%. This demonstrates its strong potential for practical use on edge devices serving latency-sensitive applications.

The same floating-point (FP) checkpoint can therefore yield inconsistent accuracy across backends, forcing practitioners to tweak flags or refactor models to vendor-friendly operator subsets. We introduce Quant-Trim, a training-phase method that produces a hardware-neutral checkpoint robust to backend and precision choices. It combines progressive fake quantization to align training with the deployed integer grid and reverse pruning to tame outlier-driven scale inflation while preserving learnability. Quant-Trim is agnostic to quantization schemes (symmetric/asymmetric,per-tensor/per-channel, INT8/INT4) and requires no vendor-specific graph changes.Across models and tasks, it narrows the FP,low-bit gap, reduces dependence on compiler heuristics/calibration, and avoids per-backend retraining.

However, despite their empirical success, the internal mechanisms by which these models represent fundamental time-series concepts remain poorly understood. In this work, we undertake a systematic investigation of concept interpretability in TSFMs. Specifically, we examine: (i) which layers encode which concepts, (ii) whether concept parameters are linearly recoverable, (iii) how representations evolve in terms of concept disentanglement and abstraction across model depth, and (iv) how models process compositions of concepts. We systematically probe these questions using layer-wise analyses, linear recoverability tests, and representation similarity measures, providing a structured account of TSFM semantics. The resulting insights show that early layers mainly capture local, time-domain patterns (e.g., AR(1), level shifts, trends), while deeper layers encode dispersion and change-time signals, with spectral and warping factors remaining the hardest to recover linearly. In compositional settings, however, probe performance degrades, revealing interference between concepts. This highlights that while atomic concepts are reliably localized, composition remains a challenge, underscoring a key limitation in current TSFMs' ability to represent interacting temporal phenomena.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u65e9\u671f\u5c42\u4e3b\u8981\u7f16\u7801\u5c40\u90e8\u65f6\u57df\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u6df1\u5c42\u7f16\u7801\u79bb\u6563\u5ea6\u548c\u53d8\u5316\u65f6\u95f4\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4f46\u7ebf\u6027\u53ef\u6062\u590d\u6027\u8f83\u5dee\uff0c\u4e14\u6982\u5ff5\u7ec4\u5408\u5b58\u5728\u5e72\u6270\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u5982\u4f55\u8868\u793a\u57fa\u672c\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u673a\u5236\u4ecd\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u6982\u5ff5\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u5206\u6790\u3001\u7ebf\u6027\u53ef\u6062\u590d\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u8868\u793a\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a2\u7a76\u6982\u5ff5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5c42\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3001\u7ebf\u6027\u53ef\u6062\u590d\u6027\u3001\u8868\u793a\u6f14\u5316\u548c\u6982\u5ff5\u7ec4\u5408\u5904\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u65e9\u671f\u5c42\u4e3b\u8981\u6355\u83b7\u5c40\u90e8\u65f6\u57df\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08\u5982AR(1)\u3001\u6c34\u5e73\u504f\u79fb\u3001\u8d8b\u52bf\uff09\uff0c\u6df1\u5c42\u7f16\u7801\u79bb\u6563\u5ea6\u548c\u53d8\u5316\u65f6\u95f4\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u9891\u8c31\u548c\u626d\u66f2\u56e0\u5b50\u6700\u96be\u7ebf\u6027\u6062\u590d\uff0c\u6982\u5ff5\u7ec4\u5408\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u867d\u7136\u539f\u5b50\u6982\u5ff5\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u4f46\u6982\u5ff5\u7ec4\u5408\u4ecd\u662f\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u8fd9\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524dTSFMs\u5728\u8868\u793a\u4ea4\u4e92\u65f6\u95f4\u73b0\u8c61\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5c40\u9650\u3002"}}

Standard reconstruction-based methods, including sequence variational autoencoders (VAEs), use a single latent process and therefore mix heterogeneous time scales, which can smooth out spikes or inflate variances and weaken anomaly separation.\n  In this paper, we present STREAM-VAE, a variational autoencoder for anomaly detection in automotive telemetry time-series data. Our model uses a dual-path encoder to separate slow drift and fast spike signal dynamics, and a decoder that represents transient deviations separately from the normal operating pattern. STREAM-VAE is designed for deployment, producing stable anomaly scores across operating modes for both in-vehicle monitors and backend fleet analytics.\n  Experiments on an automotive telemetry dataset and the public SMD benchmark show that explicitly separating drift and spike dynamics improves robustness compared to strong forecasting, attention, graph, and VAE baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "STREAM-VAE\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u6c7d\u8f66\u9065\u6d4b\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u8def\u5f84\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5206\u79bb\u6162\u901f\u6f02\u79fb\u548c\u5feb\u901f\u5c16\u5cf0\u4fe1\u53f7\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6c7d\u8f66\u9065\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u540c\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u7f13\u6162\u6f02\u79fb\u548c\u5feb\u901f\u5c16\u5cf0\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cd\u6784\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u4e00\u6f5c\u5728\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4f1a\u6df7\u5408\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5c16\u5cf0\u88ab\u5e73\u6ed1\u6216\u65b9\u5dee\u81a8\u80c0\uff0c\u524a\u5f31\u5f02\u5e38\u5206\u79bb\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u53cc\u8def\u5f84\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5206\u79bb\u6162\u901f\u6f02\u79fb\u548c\u5feb\u901f\u5c16\u5cf0\u4fe1\u53f7\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5c06\u77ac\u65f6\u504f\u5dee\u4e0e\u6b63\u5e38\u64cd\u4f5c\u6a21\u5f0f\u5206\u5f00\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4e13\u4e3a\u90e8\u7f72\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u64cd\u4f5c\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u4ea7\u751f\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u5206\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6c7d\u8f66\u9065\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u516c\u5f00SMD\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u5206\u79bb\u6f02\u79fb\u548c\u5c16\u5cf0\u52a8\u6001\u76f8\u6bd4\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u3001\u56fe\u548cVAE\uff09\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "STREAM-VAE\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u79bb\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6c7d\u8f66\u9065\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002"}}

Preserving general capabilities while acquiring downstream domain knowledge is a central challenge for large language and multimodal models. Traditional continual learning methods, such as regularization, replay and architectural isolation, suffer from poor downstream performance, reliance on inaccessible historical data, or additional parameter overhead. While recent parameter-efficient tuning (PET) methods can alleviate forgetting, their effectiveness strongly depends on the choice of parameters and update strategies. In this paper, we introduce PIECE, a Parameter Importance Estimation-based Continual Enhancement method that preserves general ability while efficiently learning domain knowledge without accessing prior training data or increasing model parameters. PIECE selectively updates only 0.1% of core parameters most relevant to new tasks, guided by two importance estimators: PIECE-F based on Fisher Information, and PIECE-S based on a second-order normalization that combines gradient and curvature information.

We apply this method to vibration data for assessing the health state of a bearing within a servo-press motor. The method transforms frequency domain reference signals into pseudo time-series patterns, generates aligned covariate and target signals, and uses the TSFM to predict probabilities how classified data corresponds to predefined labels.

This paper introduces a cost-aware prediction (CAP) framework that combines cost-benefit analysis assisted by large language model (LLM) agents to communicate the trade-offs involved in applying ML predictions. Materials and Methods: We developed an ML model predicting 1-year mortality in patients with heart failure (N = 30,021, 22% mortality) to identify those eligible for home care. We then introduced clinical impact projection (CIP) curves to visualize important cost dimensions - quality of life and healthcare provider expenses, further divided into treatment and error costs, to assess the clinical consequences of predictions. Finally, we used four LLM agents to generate patient-specific descriptions. The system was evaluated by clinicians for its decision support value. Results: The eXtreme gradient boosting (XGB) model achieved the best performance, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.804 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.792-0.816), area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) of 0.529 (95% CI 0.502-0.558) and a Brier score of 0.135 (95% CI 0.130-0.140). Discussion: The CIP cost curves provided a population-level overview of cost composition across decision thresholds, whereas LLM-generated cost-benefit analysis at individual patient-levels. The system was well received according to the evaluation by clinicians. However, feedback emphasizes the need to strengthen the technical accuracy for speculative tasks.

While numerous methods exist, the lack of a definitive ground truth for comparison highlights the need for alternative, well-founded measures. This paper introduces a novel post-hoc local feature importance method called Counterfactual Importance Distribution (CID). We generate two sets of positive and negative counterfactuals, model their distributions using Kernel Density Estimation, and rank features based on a distributional dissimilarity measure. This measure, grounded in a rigorous mathematical framework, satisfies key properties required to function as a valid metric. We showcase the effectiveness of our method by comparing with well-established local feature importance explainers. Our method not only offers complementary perspectives to existing approaches, but also improves performance on faithfulness metrics (both for comprehensiveness and sufficiency), resulting in more faithful explanations of the system.

While electroencephalography (EEG) is a practical tool for this task, existing models struggle with the common challenge of imperfect medical data, such as learning a ``normal'' baseline from weakly supervised, healthy-only cohorts. This is a critical anomaly detection task for identifying disease, but standard models are often black boxes lacking an interpretable structure. We propose EVA-Net, a novel framework that recasts brain age as an interpretable anomaly detection problem. EVA-Net uses an efficient, sparsified-attention Transformer to model long EEG sequences. To handle noise and variability in imperfect data, it employs a Variational Information Bottleneck to learn a robust, compressed representation. For interpretability, this representation is aligned to a continuous prototype network that explicitly learns the normative healthy aging manifold. Trained on 1297 healthy subjects, EVA-Net achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. We validated its anomaly detection capabilities on an unseen cohort of 27 MCI and AD patients. This pathological group showed significantly higher brain-age gaps and a novel Prototype Alignment Error, confirming their deviation from the healthy manifold.

However, balancing energy efficiency and fair participation while ensuring high model accuracy remains challenging in wireless edge systems due to heterogeneous resources, unequal client contributions, and limited communication capacity. To address these challenges, we propose FairEnergy, a fairness-aware energy minimization framework that integrates a contribution score capturing both the magnitude of updates and their compression ratio into the joint optimization of device selection, bandwidth allocation, and compression level. The resulting mixed-integer non-convex problem is solved by relaxing binary selection variables and applying Lagrangian decomposition to handle global bandwidth coupling, followed by per-device subproblem optimization. Experiments on non-IID data show that FairEnergy achieves higher accuracy while reducing energy consumption by up to 79\\% compared to baseline strategies.", "AI": {"tldr": "FairEnergy\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u516c\u5e73\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u91cf\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u8bbe\u5907\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u5e26\u5bbd\u5206\u914d\u548c\u538b\u7f29\u7ea7\u522b\uff0c\u5728\u975eIID\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e79%\u80fd\u8017", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u65e0\u7ebf\u8fb9\u7f18\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u80fd\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u516c\u5e73\u53c2\u4e0e\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e94\u5bf9\u5f02\u6784\u8d44\u6e90\u3001\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u8d21\u732e\u548c\u6709\u9650\u901a\u4fe1\u5bb9\u91cf\u7684\u6311\u6218", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFairEnergy\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5305\u542b\u66f4\u65b0\u5e45\u5ea6\u548c\u538b\u7f29\u6bd4\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u5206\u6570\u6574\u5408\u5230\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u677e\u5f1b\u4e8c\u5143\u9009\u62e9\u53d8\u91cf\u548c\u62c9\u683c\u6717\u65e5\u5206\u89e3\u5904\u7406\u5168\u5c40\u5e26\u5bbd\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u8fdb\u884c\u6bcf\u8bbe\u5907\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\u4f18\u5316", "result": "\u5728\u975eIID\u6570\u636e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cFairEnergy\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u7b56\u7565\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u80fd\u8017\u964d\u4f4e\u9ad8\u8fbe79%", "conclusion": "FairEnergy\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u65e0\u7ebf\u8fb9\u7f18\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u516c\u5e73\u53c2\u4e0e\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848"}}
