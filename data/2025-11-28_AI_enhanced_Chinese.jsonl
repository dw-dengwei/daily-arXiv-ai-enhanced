However, these methods require iterative training and depend on an initially admissible policy. This work introduces a new analytical framework that yields closed-form solutions to the HJB equation for a class of continuous-time nonlinear input-affine systems with known dynamics. Unlike ADP-based approaches, it avoids iterative learning and numerical approximation. Lyapunov theory is used to prove the asymptotic stability of the resulting closed-loop system, and theoretical guarantees are provided. The method offers a closed-form control policy derived from the HJB framework, demonstrating improved computational efficiency and optimal performance on state-of-the-art optimal control problems in the literature.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u8f93\u5165\u4eff\u5c04\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684HJB\u65b9\u7a0b\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u8bad\u7ec3\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u8fed\u4ee3\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u521d\u59cb\u53ef\u884c\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u548c\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Lyapunov\u7406\u8bba\u6784\u5efa\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u5df2\u77e5\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u8f93\u5165\u4eff\u5c04\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a8\u5bfcHJB\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u95ed\u5f0f\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u95ed\u73af\u7cfb\u7edf\u5177\u6709\u6e10\u8fd1\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u8fed\u4ee3\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

We study these abilities directly, without code execution or other tools, using the 8-puzzle: a classic task that requires state tracking and goal-directed planning while allowing precise, step-by-step evaluation. Four models are tested under common prompting conditions (Zero-Shot, Chain-of-Thought, Algorithm-of-Thought) and with tiered corrective feedback. Feedback improves success rates for some model-prompt combinations, but many successful runs are long, computationally expensive, and indirect. We then examine the models with an external move validator that provides only valid moves. Despite this level of assistance, none of the models solve any puzzles in this setting. Qualitative analysis reveals two dominant deficits across all models: (1) brittle internal state representations, leading to frequent invalid moves, and (2) weak heuristic planning, with models entering loops or selecting actions that do not reduce the distance to the goal state. These findings indicate that, in the absence of external tools such as code interpreters, current LLMs have substantial limitations in planning and that further progress may require mechanisms for maintaining explicit state and performing structured search.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLMs\u57288\u62fc\u56fe\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u89c4\u5212\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u6709\u53cd\u9988\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u8f85\u52a9\uff0c\u4ecd\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u9700\u8981\u72b6\u6001\u8ddf\u8e2a\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76LLMs\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u4ee3\u7801\u6267\u884c\u6216\u5176\u4ed6\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u72b6\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f7f\u75288\u62fc\u56fe\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "method": "\u6d4b\u8bd5\u56db\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u3001\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u3001\u7b97\u6cd5\u601d\u7ef4\u7b49\u63d0\u793a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u5206\u5c42\u7ea0\u6b63\u53cd\u9988\u548c\u5916\u90e8\u79fb\u52a8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u53cd\u9988\u5bf9\u67d0\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b-\u63d0\u793a\u7ec4\u5408\u6709\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4f46\u6210\u529f\u8fd0\u884c\u901a\u5e38\u8017\u65f6\u4e14\u95f4\u63a5\u3002\u5373\u4f7f\u6709\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u6548\u79fb\u52a8\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u4ecd\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u4efb\u4f55\u62fc\u56fe\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524dLLMs\u5728\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7ef4\u62a4\u663e\u5f0f\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u6267\u884c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u641c\u7d22\u7684\u673a\u5236\u6765\u53d6\u5f97\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002"}}

Existing memory-augmented agents mainly store past trajectories for reuse. However, trajectory-based memory suffers from brevity bias, gradually losing essential domain knowledge. More critically, even in truly multimodal problem-solving settings, it records only a single-modality trace of past behavior, failing to preserve how visual attention and logical reasoning jointly contributed to the solution. This is fundamentally misaligned with human cognition: semantic memory is both multimodal and integrated, preserving visual and abstract knowledge through coordinated but distinct representational streams. We thus introduce ViLoMem, a dual-stream memory framework that constructs compact, schema-based memory. It separately encodes visual distraction patterns and logical reasoning errors, enabling MLLMs to learn from their successful and failed experiences. Following a grow-and-refine principle, the system incrementally accumulates and updates multimodal semantic knowledge -- preserving stable, generalizable strategies while avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Across six multimodal benchmarks, ViLoMem consistently improves pass@1 accuracy and substantially reduces repeated visual and logical errors. Ablations confirm the necessity of dual-stream memory with explicit distraction--hallucination separation, demonstrating the value of error-aware multimodal memory for lifelong and cross-domain agentic learning.

Running small-scale ablation experiments on key innovations from this time period, we are able to account for less than 10x of these gains. Surveying the broader literature, we estimate that additional innovations not included in our ablations account for less than 10x, yielding a total under 100x. This leads us to conduct scaling experiments, which reveal that much of this efficiency gap can be explained by algorithms with scale-dependent efficiency improvements. In particular, we conduct scaling experiments between LSTMs and Transformers, finding exponent differences in their compute-optimal scaling law while finding little scaling difference for many other innovations. These experiments demonstrate that - contrary to standard assumptions - an algorithm's efficiency gains are tied to compute scale. Using experimental extrapolation and literature estimates, we account for 6,930x efficiency gains over the same time period, with the scale-dependent LSTM-to-Transformer transition accounting for the majority of gains. Our results indicate that algorithmic progress for small models has been far slower than previously assumed, and that measures of algorithmic efficiency are strongly reference-dependent.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u7b97\u6cd5\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u8ba1\u7b97\u89c4\u6a21\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4f20\u7edf\u8ba4\u4e3a\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u672c\u8eab\u3002LSTM\u5230Transformer\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\u8d21\u732e\u4e86\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u6548\u7387\u589e\u76ca\uff0c\u800c\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u5c55\u6bd4\u9884\u671f\u6162\u5f97\u591a\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u89c2\u70b9\u8ba4\u4e3a2012-2023\u5e74\u95f4\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f7fAI\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u4e8622,000\u500d\uff0c\u4f46\u4f5c\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0\u53ea\u80fd\u89e3\u91ca\u4e0d\u5230100\u500d\u7684\u589e\u76ca\uff0c\u8fd9\u4fc3\u4f7f\u4ed6\u4eec\u7814\u7a76\u89c4\u6a21\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u8fdb\u884c\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u6bd4\u8f83LSTM\u548cTransformer\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8ba1\u7b97\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\u7684\u6548\u7387\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5916\u63a8\u548c\u6587\u732e\u4f30\u8ba1\u6765\u5206\u6790\u6548\u7387\u589e\u76ca\u6765\u6e90\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u6548\u7387\u589e\u76ca\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u89c4\u6a21\u5bc6\u5207\u76f8\u5173\uff0cLSTM\u5230Transformer\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\u8d21\u732e\u4e86\u4e3b\u8981\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u89e3\u91ca\u4e866,930\u500d\u7684\u6548\u7387\u589e\u76ca\uff0c\u8fdc\u4f4e\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u4f30\u8ba1\u768422,000\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7b97\u6cd5\u6548\u7387\u7684\u8861\u91cf\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u70c8\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u5c55\u6bd4\u9884\u671f\u7f13\u6162\uff0c\u89c4\u6a21\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u662f\u7406\u89e3\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u6b65\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002"}}

Through a systematic empirical analysis of ViT-S, ViT-B, and ViT-L on ImageNet, we identify a consistent three-phase Cliff-Plateau-Climb pattern that governs how representations evolve with depth. We observe that better performance is associated with progressive marginalization of the [CLS] token, originally designed as a global aggregation hub, in favor of distributed consensus among patch tokens. We quantify patterns of information mixing with an Information Scrambling Index, and show that in ViT-L the information-task tradeoff emerges roughly 10 layers later than in ViT-B, and that these additional layers correlate with increased information diffusion rather than improved task performance. Taken together, these results suggest that transformer architectures in this regime may benefit more from carefully calibrated depth that executes clean phase transitions than from simply increasing parameter count.

On the other hand, next generation systems require AI models that are accurate, efficient, and sustainable.The paper questions the assumptions of equal importance by focusing on applying and analyzing the roles of individual samples in telecom training and assessing whether the proposed model optimizes computation and energy use. we perform sample-level gradient analysis across epochs to identify patterns of influence and redundancy in model learning. Based on this, we propose a sample importance framework thats electively prioritizes impactful data and reduces computation without compromising accuracy.

The difficulty stems from sparse, long-horizon rewards and the discrepancy between response-level planning and token-level generation. In this technical note, we propose a formal reduction of the multi-turn RL problem into a sequence of single-turn RLHF-style problems. This is achieved by setting a learned multi-turn Q-function as the reward model for the single-turn problem. We demonstrate and prove a key insight: solving this single-turn RL problem with standard token-level PPO is equivalent to a policy improvement step within the multi-turn problem. This insight naturally leads to Iterative PPO, a batch online policy iteration algorithm that alternates between fitting Q-functions from logged conversation trajectories and improving the policy. A major practical advantage is that Iterative PPO directly leverages stable, off-the-shelf single-turn RLHF tools, making it straightforward to implement.

Experiments across diverse workloads show that DSD achieves up to 1.1x speedup and 9.7% higher throughput over existing SD baselines, enabling agile and scalable LLM serving across edge and cloud.", "AI": {"tldr": "DSD\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u534f\u8c03\u8349\u7a3f-\u76ee\u6807\u6267\u884c\u5c06\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u591a\u8bbe\u5907\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86LLM\u63a8\u7406\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u8fb9\u7f18-\u4e91\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u6709\u9650\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u8fb9\u7f18-\u4e91\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u9ad8\u89e3\u7801\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u6709\u9650\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u6280\u672f\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8e\u5355\u8282\u70b9\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8d44\u6e90\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDSD\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165DSD-Sim\u79bb\u6563\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u6765\u6a21\u62df\u7f51\u7edc\u3001\u6279\u5904\u7406\u548c\u8c03\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7a97\u53e3\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u63a8\u6d4b\u7a97\u53e3\u5927\u5c0f\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793aDSD\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u57fa\u7ebf\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u9ad81.1\u500d\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u548c9.7%\u7684\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u548c\u4e91\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u654f\u6377\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684LLM\u670d\u52a1\u3002", "conclusion": "DSD\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86LLM\u63a8\u7406\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u4e3a\u8fb9\u7f18-\u4e91\u534f\u540c\u7684LLM\u670d\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}
