Our main result establishes that (quasi-)optimal trajectories of a discounted control problem converge globally and practically asymptotically to the set of global minimizers. Specifically, for any tolerance $η> 0$, there exist parameters $λ$ (discount rate) and $t$ (time horizon) such that trajectories remain within an $η$-neighborhood of the global minimizers after some finite time $τ$. This convergence is achieved directly, without solving ergodic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations. We prove parallel results for three problem formulations: evolutive discounted, stationary discounted, and evolutive non-discounted cases. The analysis relies on occupation measures to quantify the fraction of time trajectories spend away from the minimizer set, establishing both reachability and stability properties."}

The predictions for the dynamics, the state measurements, and the solution of the auxiliary open-loop control problems that appear at every step of the MPC method may be inaccurate. The main result provides an error estimate of the MPC-generated solution compared with the optimal open-loop solution of the ``ideal'' problem, where all predictions and measurements are exact. The technique of proving the estimate involves an extension of the notion of strong metric sub-regularity of set-valued maps and utilization of a specific new metric in the control space, which makes the proof non-standard. The result is specialized for two problem classes: coercive problems, and affine problems."}

The analysis provides explicit convergence rates for both the variational behavior of the value function and the pathwise convergence of the optimal trajectories. This paper is a companion to our previous work, where a more general framework was introduced; here, we focus on a specific setting in which sharper and more detailed results can be established."}

Electric Vehicles (EVs) are used as a source of flexibility and are often aggregated for problem tractability. We develop a new approach to integrate EV flexibilities in the UC problem and exploit the generalized polymatroid structure of aggregated flexibilities of a large population of users to develop an exact optimization algorithm, combining a cutting-plane approach and submodular optimization. We show in particular that the UC can be solved exactly in a time which scales linearly, up to a logarithmic factor, in the number of EV users when each production unit is subject to convex constraints. We illustrate our approach by solving a real instance of a long-term UC problem, combining open-source data of the European grid (European Resource Adequacy Assessment project) and data originating from a survey of user behavior of the French EV fleet."}

For gradient-based optimizers, we define this entropy over a finite set of goals {g_i} as S = -Σ p(g_i; theta) ln p(g_i; theta), and we prove that its time derivative dS/dt >= 0, driven by exploration noise and specification gaming. We derive the critical stability boundary for alignment work as gamma_crit = (lambda_max / 2) ln N, where lambda_max is the dominant eigenvalue of the Fisher Information Matrix and N is the number of model parameters. Simulations validate this theory. A 7-billion-parameter model (N = 7 x 10^9) with lambda_max = 1.2 drifts from an initial entropy of 0.32 to 1.69 +/- 1.08 nats, while a system regularized with alignment work gamma = 20.4 (1.5 gamma_crit) maintains stability at 0.00 +/- 0.00 nats (p = 4.19 x 10^-17, n = 20 trials). This framework recasts AI alignment as a problem of continuous thermodynamic control, providing a quantitative foundation for maintaining the stability and safety of advanced autonomous systems."}

For the differentiable case of $σ$-quasiconvexity, we establish the full equivalence between several first-order conditions, resolving a remaining implication left open in the recent literature. Our approach yields a concise, self-contained proof of a classical characterization originally stated in the 1970s and sharpens the first-order theory for strong quasiconvexity."}
