Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) embed the governing equations into the learning process, enabling mesh-free solution of PDEs, yet they often struggle to capture steep gradients, discontinuities, and complex nonlinear wave interactions. To address these limitations, this study employs the Extended Physics-Informed Neural Network (XPINN) framework to solve the nonlinear Buckley-Leverett equation with a nonconvex flux function, which models immiscible two-phase flow in porous media. The computational domain is dynamically decomposed in space and time into evolving pre-shock and post-shock regions, allowing localized subnetworks to efficiently learn distinct flow behaviors. Coupling between subnetworks is achieved through the Rankine-Hugoniot jump condition, which enforces physically consistent flux continuity across the moving shock interface. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed XPINN approach accurately captures discontinuous saturation fronts and compound wave interactions without requiring artificial diffusion or entropy corrections. Compared to standard PINNs, the XPINN framework achieves superior stability, faster convergence, and enhanced resolution of nonlinear wave dynamics using smaller, domain-specific models with fewer trainable parameters, establishing it as an effective and scalable tool for solving challenging hyperbolic PDEs in multiphase flow problems.

Cycle)", "summary": "Trajectory representation learning (TRL) maps trajectories to vector embeddings and facilitates tasks such as trajectory classification and similarity search. State-of-the-art (SOTA) TRL methods transform raw GPS trajectories to grid or road trajectories to capture high-level travel semantics, i.e., regions and roads. However, they lose fine-grained spatial-temporal details as multiple GPS points are grouped into a single grid cell or road segment. To tackle this problem, we propose the BLUrred Encoding method, dubbed BLUE, which gradually reduces the precision of GPS coordinates to create hierarchical patches with multiple levels. The low-level patches are small and preserve fine-grained spatial-temporal details, while the high-level patches are large and capture overall travel patterns. To complement different patch levels with each other, our BLUE is an encoder-decoder model with a pyramid structure. At each patch level, a Transformer is used to learn the trajectory embedding at the current level, while pooling prepares inputs for the higher level in the encoder, and up-resolution provides guidance for the lower level in the decoder. BLUE is trained using the trajectory reconstruction task with the MSE loss. We compare BLUE with 8 SOTA TRL methods for 3 downstream tasks, the results show that BLUE consistently achieves higher accuracy than all baselines, outperforming the best-performing baselines by an average of 30.90%.

In this paper, we propose DeepDefense, a novel defense framework that applies Gradient-Feature Alignment (GFA) regularization across multiple layers to suppress adversarial vulnerability. By aligning input gradients with internal feature representations, DeepDefense promotes a smoother loss landscape in tangential directions, thereby reducing the model's sensitivity to adversarial noise.\n  We provide theoretical insights into how adversarial perturbation can be decomposed into radial and tangential components and demonstrate that alignment suppresses loss variation in tangential directions, where most attacks are effective. Empirically, our method achieves significant improvements in robustness across both gradient-based and optimization-based attacks. For example, on CIFAR-10, CNN models trained with DeepDefense outperform standard adversarial training by up to 15.2% under APGD attacks and 24.7% under FGSM attacks. Against optimization-based attacks such as DeepFool and EADEN, DeepDefense requires 20 to 30 times higher perturbation magnitudes to cause misclassification, indicating stronger decision boundaries and a flatter loss landscape.

However, spatial reasoning:a fundamental component of human cognition that includes mental rotation, navigation, and spatial relationship comprehension remains a significant challenge for current advanced VLMs. We hypothesize that imagination, the internal simulation of spatial states, is the dominant reasoning mechanism within a spatial world model. To test this hypothesis and systematically probe current VLM spatial reasoning mechanisms, we introduce SpatiaLite, a fully synthetic benchmark that jointly measures spatial reasoning accuracy and reasoning efficiency. Comprehensive experiments reveal three key findings. First, advanced VLMs predominantly rely on linguistic representations for reasoning and imagination, resulting in significant deficiencies on visual centric tasks that demand perceptual spatial relations and 3D geometry transformations such as mental rotation or projection prediction. Second, advanced VLMs exhibit severe inefficiency in their current spatial reasoning mechanisms, with token usage growing rapidly as transformation complexity increases. Third, we propose an Imagery Driven Framework (IDF) for data synthesis and training, which can implicitly construct an internal world model that is critical for spatial reasoning in VLMs. Building on SpatiaLite, this work delineates the spatial reasoning limits and patterns of advanced VLMs, identifies key shortcomings, and informs future advances", "AI": {"tldr": "SpatiaLite\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5408\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u524d\u5148\u8fdbVLM\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u8db3\u4e14\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51faImagery Driven Framework\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5148\u8fdb\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\uff08\u5982\u5fc3\u7406\u65cb\u8f6c\u3001\u5bfc\u822a\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u7406\u89e3\uff09\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165SpatiaLite\u5408\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u6d4b\u91cf\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u9762\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5206\u6790VLM\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b\u63d0\u51faImagery Driven Framework\u7528\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ed3\u679c\uff1a1\uff09\u5148\u8fdbVLM\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u8db3\uff1b2\uff09VLM\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u4e25\u91cd\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0ctoken\u4f7f\u7528\u968f\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5feb\u901f\u589e\u957f\uff1b3\uff09IDF\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u9690\u5f0f\u6784\u5efa\u5185\u90e8\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u754c\u5b9a\u4e86\u5148\u8fdbVLM\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u9650\u5236\u548c\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4fe1\u606f\u3002IDF\u6846\u67b6\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6784\u5efa\u652f\u6301\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

Khademul Islam Molla", "Abu Saleh Musa Miah", "Md. Abdus Samad Kamal"], "title": "Motor Imagery Classification Using Feature Fusion of Spatially Weighted Electroencephalography", "comment": null, "summary": "A Brain Computer Interface (BCI) connects the human brain to the outside world, providing a direct communication channel. Electroencephalography (EEG) signals are commonly used in BCIs to reflect cognitive patterns related to motor function activities. However, due to the multichannel nature of EEG signals, explicit information processing is crucial to lessen computational complexity in BCI systems. This study proposes an innovative method based on brain region-specific channel selection and multi-domain feature fusion to improve classification accuracy. The novelty of the proposed approach lies in region-based channel selection, where EEG channels are grouped according to their functional relevance to distinct brain regions. By selecting channels based on specific regions involved in motor imagery (MI) tasks, this technique eliminates irrelevant channels, reducing data dimensionality and improving computational efficiency. This also ensures that the extracted features are more reflective of the brain actual activity related to motor tasks. Three distinct feature extraction methods Common Spatial Pattern (CSP), Fuzzy C-means clustering, and Tangent Space Mapping (TSM), are applied to each group of channels based on their brain region. Each method targets different characteristics of the EEG signal: CSP focuses on spatial patterns, Fuzzy C means identifies clusters within the data, and TSM captures non-linear patterns in the signal.

A key factor influencing MFC performance is the anode structure, where design and material properties play a crucial role. Existing predictive models struggle to capture the complex geometric dependencies necessary to optimize these structures. To solve this problem, we propose KANGURA: Kolmogorov-Arnold Network-Based Geometry-Aware Learning with Unified Representation Attention. KANGURA introduces a new approach to three-dimensional (3D) machine learning modeling. It formulates prediction as a function decomposition problem, where Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN)- based representation learning reconstructs geometric relationships without a conventional multi- layer perceptron (MLP). To refine spatial understanding, geometry-disentangled representation learning separates structural variations into interpretable components, while unified attention mechanisms dynamically enhance critical geometric regions. Experimental results demonstrate that KANGURA outperforms over 15 state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on the ModelNet40 benchmark dataset, achieving 92.7% accuracy, and excels in a real-world MFC anode structure problem with 97% accuracy. This establishes KANGURA as a robust framework for 3D geometric modeling, unlocking new possibilities for optimizing complex structures in advanced manufacturing and quality-driven engineering applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86KANGURA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eKolmogorov-Arnold Network\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u5fae\u751f\u7269\u71c3\u6599\u7535\u6c60\u9633\u6781\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u590d\u6742\u51e0\u4f55\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u5fae\u751f\u7269\u71c3\u6599\u7535\u6c60\u9633\u6781\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u9884\u6d4b\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u51fd\u6570\u5206\u89e3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528KAN\u7f51\u7edc\u91cd\u6784\u51e0\u4f55\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u51e0\u4f55\u89e3\u8026\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u7edf\u4e00\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u589e\u5f3a\u7a7a\u95f4\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u5728ModelNet40\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e15\u4e2aSOTA\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8fbe\u523092.7%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff1b\u5728\u771f\u5b9eMFC\u9633\u6781\u7ed3\u6784\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523097%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "KANGURA\u4e3a\u4e09\u7ef4\u51e0\u4f55\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7a33\u5065\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u5148\u8fdb\u5236\u9020\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u9a71\u52a8\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u590d\u6742\u7ed3\u6784\u4f18\u5316\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002"}}

Recent studies demonstrate that fine-tuned LLMs can accurately predict vehicle trajectories and lane-change intentions by gathering and transforming data from surrounding vehicles. However, the robustness of such LLM-based prediction models for safety-critical driving systems remains unexplored, despite the increasing concerns about the trustworthiness of LLMs. This study addresses this gap by conducting a systematic vulnerability analysis of LLM-enabled vehicle trajectory prediction. We propose a one-feature differential evolution attack that perturbs a single kinematic feature of surrounding vehicles within the LLM's input prompts under a black-box setting. Experiments on the highD dataset reveal that even minor, physically plausible perturbations can significantly disrupt model outputs, underscoring the susceptibility of LLM-based predictors to adversarial manipulation. Further analyses reveal a trade-off between accuracy and robustness, examine the failure mechanism, and explore potential mitigation solutions. The findings provide the very first insights into adversarial vulnerabilities of LLM-driven automated vehicle models in the context of vehicular interactions and highlight the need for robustness-oriented design in future LLM-based intelligent transportation systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u4e86LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8f66\u8f86\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u9ed1\u76d2\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5bf9\u5355\u4e2a\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5fae\u5c0f\u6270\u52a8\u4e5f\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u7834\u574f\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86LLM\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1LLM\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790LLM\u8f66\u8f86\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5355\u7279\u5f81\u5dee\u5206\u8fdb\u5316\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u9ed1\u76d2\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u6270\u52a8\u5468\u56f4\u8f66\u8f86\u7684\u5355\u4e2a\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u5728highD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5fae\u5c0f\u4e14\u7269\u7406\u4e0a\u5408\u7406\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u4e5f\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u7834\u574f\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86LLM\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u5bf9\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u64cd\u7eb5\u7684\u9ad8\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u63ed\u793aLLM\u9a71\u52a8\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8f66\u8f86\u4ea4\u4e92\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u5bf9\u6297\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u672a\u6765LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4ea4\u901a\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u8981\u9762\u5411\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

Hypothesis 2: baseline expression of OGT and CDO1 predicts the strength of repressed and induced radiation-response modules in breast cancer cells (GSE59732). Hypothesis 3: a 12-gene expression signature predicts biochemical recurrence-free survival after prostate radiotherapy plus androgen deprivation therapy (GSE116918). The DDR-p53 hypothesis was not supported: DDR score and p53 response were weakly negatively correlated (Spearman rho = -0.40, p = 0.76), indistinguishable from random five-gene scores.

During joint multimodal training, due to modality bias, the advantaged modality often dominates backpropagation, leading to imbalanced optimization. Existing methods still face two problems: First, the long-term dominance of the dominant modality weakens representation-output coupling in the late stages of training, resulting in the accumulation of redundant information. Second, previous methods often directly and uniformly adjust the gradients of the advantaged modality, ignoring the semantics and directionality between modalities. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive Redundancy Regulation for Balanced Multimodal Information Refinement (RedReg), which is inspired by information bottleneck principle. Specifically, we construct a redundancy phase monitor that uses a joint criterion of effective gain growth rate and redundancy to trigger intervention only when redundancy is high. Furthermore, we design a co-information gating mechanism to estimate the contribution of the current dominant modality based on cross-modal semantics. When the task primarily relies on a single modality, the suppression term is automatically disabled to preserve modality-specific information. Finally, we project the gradient of the dominant modality onto the orthogonal complement of the joint multimodal gradient subspace and suppress the gradient according to redundancy. Experiments show that our method demonstrates superiority among current major methods in most scenarios. Ablation experiments verify the effectiveness of our method.

They assumed that the SCMs were learned from purely observational data, leading to an imprecise characterization of the marginal distributions of exogenous variables. Their method leveraged the canonical representation of structural equations to decompose a general SCM with high-cardinality exogenous variables into a set of sub-models with low-cardinality exogenous variables. These sub-models had precise marginals over the exogenous variables and therefore admitted efficient exact inference. The aggregated results were used to bound counterfactual probabilities in the original model. The approach was developed for Markovian models, where each exogenous variable affects only a single endogenous variable. In this paper, we investigate extending the methodology to \\textit{semi-Markovian} SCMs, where exogenous variables may influence multiple endogenous variables. Such models are capable of representing confounding relationships that Markovian models cannot. We illustrate the challenges of this extension using a minimal example, which motivates a set of alternative solution strategies.

We propose convex relaxation approaches based on marginal and cluster moment relaxations that exploit locality and correlative sparsity in the distributions. These methods approximate high-dimensional couplings using low-order marginals and sparse moment statistics, yielding semidefinite programs that provide lower bounds on the OT cost with greatly reduced complexity. For Gaussian distributions with sparse correlations, we prove reductions in both computational and sample complexity, and experiments show the approach also works well for non-Gaussian cases. In addition, we demonstrate how to extract transport maps from our relaxations, offering a simpler and interpretable alternative to neural networks in generative modeling. Our results suggest that convex relaxations can provide a promising path for dimension reduction in high-dimensional OT.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fb9\u9645\u548c\u805a\u7c7b\u77e9\u677e\u5f1b\u7684\u51f8\u677e\u5f1b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5206\u5e03\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u6765\u8fd1\u4f3c\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u9762\u4e34\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u5229\u7528\u5206\u5e03\u7ed3\u6784\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u7684\u964d\u7ef4\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u8fb9\u9645\u548c\u805a\u7c7b\u77e9\u677e\u5f1b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u9636\u8fb9\u9645\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u77e9\u7edf\u8ba1\u6765\u8fd1\u4f3c\u9ad8\u7ef4\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u534a\u5b9a\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5177\u6709\u7a00\u758f\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u964d\u4f4e\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5728\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4e5f\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u63d0\u53d6\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4f20\u8f93\u6620\u5c04\u3002", "conclusion": "\u51f8\u677e\u5f1b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u7684\u964d\u7ef4\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u7684\u66f4\u7b80\u5355\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Sudden changes in a time series can still be captured by a cumulative distribution function (CDF), while a point prediction is likely to miss it entirely. The modeling of CDFs within forecasts has historically been limited to parametric approaches, but due to recent advances, this no longer has to be the case. We aim to advance the fields of probabilistic forecasting and monotonic networks by connecting them and propose an approach that permits the forecasting of implicit, complete, and nonparametric CDFs. For this purpose, we propose an adaptation to deep lattice networks (DLN) for monotonically constrained simultaneous/implicit quantile regression in time series forecasting. Quantile regression usually produces quantile crossovers, which need to be prevented to achieve a legitimate CDF. By leveraging long short term memory units (LSTM) as the embedding layer, and spreading quantile inputs to all sub-lattices of a DLN with an extended output size, we can produce a multi-horizon forecast of an implicit CDF due to the monotonic constraintability of DLNs that prevent quantile crossovers. We compare and evaluate our approach's performance to relevant state of the art within the context of a highly relevant application of time series forecasting: Day-ahead, hourly forecasts of solar irradiance observations. Our experiments show that the adaptation of a DLN performs just as well or even better than an unconstrained approach. Further comparison of the adapted DLN against a scalable monotonic neural network shows that our approach performs better. With this adaptation of DLNs, we intend to create more interest and crossover investigations in techniques of monotonic neural networks and probabilistic forecasting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u683c\u5b50\u7f51\u7edc(DLN)\u7684\u5355\u8c03\u7ea6\u675f\u9690\u5f0f\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u56de\u5f52\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u6982\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u5b8c\u6574\u3001\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u7d2f\u79ef\u5206\u5e03\u51fd\u6570(CDF)\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u4ea4\u53c9\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u6982\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u591a\u672a\u6765\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u5f25\u8865\u70b9\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5f31\u70b9\u3002\u4f20\u7edfCDF\u5efa\u6a21\u9650\u4e8e\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u8fde\u63a5\u6982\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u5355\u8c03\u7f51\u7edc\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9690\u5f0f\u3001\u5b8c\u6574\u3001\u975e\u53c2\u6570CDF\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u957f\u77ed\u671f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5355\u5143(LSTM)\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5d4c\u5165\u5c42\uff0c\u5c06\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u8f93\u5165\u6269\u5c55\u5230DLN\u7684\u6240\u6709\u5b50\u683c\u5b50\uff0c\u5229\u7528DLN\u7684\u5355\u8c03\u7ea6\u675f\u80fd\u529b\u9632\u6b62\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u4ea4\u53c9\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u65f6\u95f4\u8303\u56f4\u7684\u9690\u5f0fCDF\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u592a\u9633\u8f90\u7167\u5ea6\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u65e5\u524d\u5c0f\u65f6\u9884\u6d4b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u65e0\u7ea6\u675f\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u4e14\u4f18\u4e8e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5355\u8c03\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7DLN\u7684\u9002\u914d\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5355\u8c03\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u6982\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u6280\u672f\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u7814\u7a76\u5174\u8da3\u3002"}}

Despite recent advances in deep learning models for medical time-series forecasting, several challenges persist, including the lack of standardized benchmarks, incomplete data, and limited cross-center validation. To address these challenges, we introduce VitalBench, a novel benchmark specifically designed for intraoperative vital sign prediction. VitalBench includes data from over 4,000 surgeries across two independent medical centers, offering three evaluation tracks: complete data, incomplete data, and cross-center generalization. This framework reflects the real-world complexities of clinical practice, minimizing reliance on extensive preprocessing and incorporating masked loss techniques for robust and unbiased model evaluation.

Pattern-matching systems can encounter issues where exponential time and space are required to find matches for rules with many underconstrained variables, or which produce combinatorial intermediate partial matches (but are otherwise well-constrained). When online AI systems automatically generate rules from example-driven induction or code synthesis, they can easily produce worst-case matching patterns that slow or halt program execution by exceeding available memory. In our own work with cognitive systems that learn from example, we've found that aggressive forms of anti-unification-based generalization can easily produce these circumstances. To make these systems practical without hand-engineering constraints or succumbing to unpredictable failure modes, we introduce a new matching algorithm called CORGI (Collection-Oriented Relational Graph Iteration). Unlike RETE-based approaches, CORGI offers quadratic time and space guarantees for finding single satisficing matches, and the ability to iteratively stream subsequent matches without committing entire conflict sets to memory. CORGI differs from RETE in that it does not have a traditional $\u03b2$-memory for collecting partial matches. Instead, CORGI takes a two-step approach: a graph of grounded relations is built/maintained in a forward pass, and an iterator generates matches as needed by working backward through the graph. This approach eliminates the high-latency delays and memory overflows that can result from populating full conflict sets. In a performance evaluation, we demonstrate that CORGI significantly outperforms RETE implementations from SOAR and OPS5 on a simple combinatorial matching task.", "AI": {"tldr": "CORGI\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u5339\u914d\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u65f6AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u67e5\u8be2\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e8c\u6b21\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u907f\u514dRETE\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u6307\u6570\u7ea7\u5185\u5b58\u6d88\u8017\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b9e\u65f6AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u67e5\u8be2\u4e2d\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9047\u5230\u5177\u6709\u591a\u4e2a\u672a\u7ea6\u675f\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u89c4\u5219\u65f6\uff0c\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u6307\u6570\u7ea7\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7cfb\u7edf\u53d8\u6162\u6216\u5d29\u6e83\u3002", "method": "CORGI\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u6b65\u6cd5\uff1a\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u9012\u6784\u5efa/\u7ef4\u62a4\u63a5\u5730\u5173\u7cfb\u56fe\uff0c\u540e\u5411\u8fed\u4ee3\u5668\u6309\u9700\u751f\u6210\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfRETE\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e2d\u6536\u96c6\u90e8\u5206\u5339\u914d\u7684\u03b2\u5185\u5b58\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0cCORGI\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u7ec4\u5408\u5339\u914d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eSOAR\u548cOPS5\u7684RETE\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "CORGI\u901a\u8fc7\u6d88\u9664\u586b\u5145\u5b8c\u6574\u51b2\u7a81\u96c6\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u9ad8\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u6ea2\u51fa\uff0c\u4f7f\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u7684\u89c4\u5219\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u66f4\u52a0\u53ef\u884c\u3002"}}

However, these models often produce chemically invalid molecules, which limits the usable scope of the learned chemical space and poses significant challenges for practical applications. To address this issue, we propose ChemFixer, a framework designed to correct invalid molecules into valid ones. ChemFixer is built on a transformer architecture, pre-trained using masking techniques, and fine-tuned on a large-scale dataset of valid/invalid molecular pairs that we constructed. Through comprehensive evaluations across diverse generative models, ChemFixer improved molecular validity while effectively preserving the chemical and biological distributional properties of the original outputs. This indicates that ChemFixer can recover molecules that could not be previously generated, thereby expanding the diversity of potential drug candidates. Furthermore, ChemFixer was effectively applied to a drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction task using limited data, improving the validity of generated ligands and discovering promising ligand-protein pairs. These results suggest that ChemFixer is not only effective in data-limited scenarios, but also extensible to a wide range of downstream tasks. Taken together, ChemFixer shows promise as a practical tool for various stages of deep learning-based drug discovery, enhancing molecular validity and expanding accessible chemical space.", "AI": {"tldr": "ChemFixer\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5c06\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u5b50\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u65e0\u6548\u5206\u5b50\u4fee\u6b63\u4e3a\u6709\u6548\u5206\u5b50\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5206\u5b50\u6709\u6548\u6027\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u5316\u5b66\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u5b50\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7ecf\u5e38\u4ea7\u751f\u5316\u5b66\u65e0\u6548\u7684\u5206\u5b50\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u5316\u5b66\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u53ef\u4f7f\u7528\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u7ed9\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u91cd\u5927\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u63a9\u7801\u6280\u672f\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6709\u6548/\u65e0\u6548\u5206\u5b50\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "ChemFixer\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5206\u5b50\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u539f\u59cb\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u5316\u5b66\u548c\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u5206\u5e03\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u6210\u529f\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u836f\u7269-\u9776\u70b9\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "conclusion": "ChemFixer\u6709\u671b\u6210\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u836f\u7269\u53d1\u73b0\u5404\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u589e\u5f3a\u5206\u5b50\u6709\u6548\u6027\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u7684\u5316\u5b66\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002"}}

However, acquiring such datasets is difficult because capturing accident-triggering scenarios as they occur is nearly impossible. To overcome this limitation, this study presents a novel scene graph-guided generative AI framework that synthesizes photorealistic images of hazardous scenarios grounded in historical Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) accident reports. OSHA narratives are analyzed using GPT-4o to extract structured hazard reasoning, which is converted into object-level scene graphs capturing spatial and contextual relationships essential for understanding risk. These graphs guide a text-to-image diffusion model to generate compositionally accurate hazard scenes. To evaluate the realism and semantic fidelity of the generated data, a visual question answering (VQA) framework is introduced.

In our formulation, heterogeneous Wasserstein ball constraints on each distribution are enforced through a penalty function leveraging a Lagrangian formulation. We then formulate the distributionally robust Nash equilibrium problem and show that under certain assumptions it is equivalent to a finite-dimensional variational inequality problem with a strongly monotone mapping.

To address this low-resource challenge, we propose a self-training framework that leverages abundant unlabeled data through collaborative pseudo-labeling. Starting with a lightweight classifier trained on limited labeled data, our method iteratively assigns pseudo-labels to unlabeled instances with the support of Multi-Agent Vision-Language Models (MA-VLMs). Un-labeled data on which the classifier and MA-VLMs agree are designated as the Agreed-Unknown set, while conflicting samples form the Disagreed-Unknown set. To enhance label reliability, MA-VLMs simulate dual perspectives, moderator and user, capturing both regulatory and subjective viewpoints. The classifier is optimized using a novel Positive-Negative-Unlabeled (PNU) loss, which jointly exploits labeled, Agreed-Unknown, and Disagreed-Unknown data while mitigating pseudo-label noise.

We synthesize the historical evolution from rule-based models to contemporary approaches involving deep learning, multi-agent architectures, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) frameworks. The pedagogical implications are evaluated through a dual-case methodology: (1) the use of generative AI platforms in secondary education to foster analytical and creative skills; (2) the design of a multiagent system for symbolic music analysis, enabling modular, scalable, and explainable workflows.\n  Experimental results demonstrate that AI agents effectively enhance musical pattern recognition, compositional parameterization, and educational feedback, outperforming traditional automated methods in terms of interpretability and adaptability. The findings highlight key challenges concerning transparency, cultural bias, and the definition of hybrid evaluation metrics, emphasizing the need for responsible deployment of AI in educational environments.\n  This research contributes to a unified framework that bridges technical, pedagogical, and ethical considerations, offering evidence-based guidance for the design and application of intelligent agents in computational musicology and music education.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u5e76\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86AI\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u97f3\u4e50\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6559\u80b2\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4ece\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5230\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u67b6\u6784\u548cRAG\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6f14\u8fdb\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u6848\u4f8b\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u6559\u5b66\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22AI\u4ee3\u7406\u5982\u4f55\u63d0\u5347\u97f3\u4e50\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6559\u80b2\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6a21\u5f0f\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u521b\u4f5c\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u548c\u6559\u80b2\u53cd\u9988\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5173\u6ce8\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u3001\u6587\u5316\u504f\u89c1\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u6848\u4f8b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a(1)\u5728\u4e2d\u7b49\u6559\u80b2\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5e73\u53f0\u57f9\u517b\u5206\u6790\u548c\u521b\u9020\u6280\u80fd\uff1b(2)\u8bbe\u8ba1\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u884c\u7b26\u53f7\u97f3\u4e50\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cAI\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u97f3\u4e50\u6a21\u5f0f\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u521b\u4f5c\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u548c\u6559\u80b2\u53cd\u9988\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u6280\u672f\u3001\u6559\u5b66\u548c\u4f26\u7406\u8003\u91cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u8ba1\u7b97\u97f3\u4e50\u5b66\u548c\u97f3\u4e50\u6559\u80b2\u4e2d\u667a\u80fd\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

However, real-world deployments often involve mixed distribution shifts, where test samples are affected by diverse and potentially conflicting domain factors, posing significant challenges even for SOTA TTA methods. A key limitation in existing approaches is their reliance on a unified adaptation path, which fails to account for the fact that optimal gradient directions can vary significantly across different domains. Moreover, current benchmarks focus only on synthetic or homogeneous shifts, failing to capture the complexity of real-world heterogeneous mixed distribution shifts. To address this, we propose MoETTA, a novel entropy-based TTA framework that integrates the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. Rather than enforcing a single parameter update rule for all test samples, MoETTA introduces a set of structurally decoupled experts, enabling adaptation along diverse gradient directions. This design allows the model to better accommodate heterogeneous shifts through flexible and disentangled parameter updates. To simulate realistic deployment conditions, we introduce two new benchmarks: potpourri and potpourri+. While classical settings focus solely on synthetic corruptions, potpourri encompasses a broader range of domain shifts--including natural, artistic, and adversarial distortions--capturing more realistic deployment challenges. Additionally, potpourri+ further includes source-domain samples to evaluate robustness against catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments across three mixed distribution shifts settings show that MoETTA consistently outperforms strong baselines, establishing SOTA performance and highlighting the benefit of modeling multiple adaptation directions via expert-level diversity.", "AI": {"tldr": "MoETTA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u71b5\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u6210\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u67b6\u6784\u6765\u5904\u7406\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u5e38\u9047\u5230\u6df7\u5408\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u73b0\u6709TTA\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u540c\u57df\u95f4\u53ef\u80fd\u51b2\u7a81\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u4e14\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u5408\u6210\u6216\u540c\u8d28\u504f\u79fb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMoETTA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u7ed3\u6784\u89e3\u8026\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u96c6\u5408\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u6cbf\u4e0d\u540c\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u5411\u8fdb\u884c\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7075\u6d3b\u89e3\u8026\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u6df7\u5408\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMoETTA\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u5bb6\u7ea7\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u591a\u4e2a\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u5411\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\uff0cMoETTA\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u9002\u5e94\u5f02\u6784\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u90e8\u7f72\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

To address these challenges, this paper introduces ALEX (A Light Editing-knowledge Extractor), a lightweight knowledge editing framework. The core innovation of ALEX is its hierarchical memory architecture, which organizes knowledge updates (edits) into semantic clusters. This design fundamentally reduces retrieval complexity from a linear O(N) to a highly scalable O(K+N/C). Furthermore, the framework integrates an Inferential Query Synthesis (IQS) module to bridge the semantic gap between queries and facts , and a Dynamic Evidence Adjudication (DEA) engine that executes an efficient two-stage retrieval process.

However, the proximal linear surrogate function may suffer from low approximation accuracy, which leads to slow convergence of DA and MM. To accelerate their convergence, we adapt the proximal bundle surrogate framework that can incorporate a list of more accurate surrogate functions, to both the primal and the dual updates of DA and MM, leading to a family of novel primal-dual bundle methods. Our methods generalize the primal-dual gradient method, DA, the linearized MM, and MM. Under standard assumptions that allow for a broad range of surrogate functions, we prove theoretical convergence guarantees for the proposed methods. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our methods converge not only faster, but also significantly more robust with respect to the parameters compared to the primal-dual gradient method, DA, the linearized MM, and MM.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u539f\u59cb-\u5bf9\u5076\u675f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u51fd\u6570\u6765\u52a0\u901f\u5bf9\u5076\u4e0a\u5347\u6cd5\u548c\u4e58\u5b50\u6cd5\u7684\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5bf9\u5076\u4e0a\u5347\u6cd5\u548c\u4e58\u5b50\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u8fd1\u7aef\u7ebf\u6027\u4ee3\u7406\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u4f46\u8be5\u51fd\u6570\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8f83\u4f4e\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u8f83\u6162\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5bf9\u5076\u4e0a\u5347\u6cd5\u548c\u4e58\u5b50\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u539f\u59cb\u548c\u5bf9\u5076\u66f4\u65b0\u90fd\u9002\u914d\u5230\u8fd1\u7aef\u675f\u4ee3\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u51fd\u6570\u5217\u8868\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u6536\u655b\u66f4\u5feb\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5bf9\u53c2\u6570\u9009\u62e9\u66f4\u52a0\u9c81\u68d2\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u539f\u59cb-\u5bf9\u5076\u675f\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u4f20\u7edf\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

In contrast, tokens, which play essential roles in many research fields, exhibit similar characteristics of growth, yet investigations into their incremental learning remain significantly scarce. This research gap primarily stems from the holistic nature of tokens in language, which imposes significant challenges on the design of incremental learning frameworks for them. To overcome this obstacle, in this work, we turn to a type of token, gene, for a large-scale biological dataset--single-cell transcriptomics--to formulate a pipeline for gene incremental learning and establish corresponding evaluations. We found that the forgetting problem also exists in gene incremental learning, thus we adapted existing class incremental learning methods to mitigate the forgetting of genes. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrated the soundness of our framework design and evaluations, as well as the effectiveness of our method adaptations.

While the role of AI in such situations is gaining attention for making optimal decisions within limited resources and time, its development and performance evaluation require benchmark datasets of sufficient quantity and quality. However, MCIs occur infrequently, and sufficient records are difficult to accumulate at the scene, making it challenging to collect large-scale realworld data for research use. Therefore, we developed Syn-STARTS, a framework that uses LLMs to generate triage cases, and verified its effectiveness. The results showed that the triage cases generated by Syn-STARTS were qualitatively indistinguishable from the TRIAGE open dataset generated by manual curation from training materials. Furthermore, when evaluating the LLM accuracy using hundreds of cases each from the green, yellow, red, and black categories defined by the standard triage method START, the results were found to be highly stable.

Specifically, we construct a 2D placement model at the component level in which we include near-continuous rotation of components and allow for irregular subsystem geometries to make optimal use of the limited design space. Second, we introduce linearization techniques for the trigonometric constraints and formulate the placement problem as a mixed-integer quadratic program (MIQP). Finally, we demonstrate our framework on two electric motorcycle powertrain topologies and study the influence of the geometry complexity on the placement solutions.

Achieving near-peak performance still demands deep hardware expertise-experts either handcraft target-specific kernels (e.g., DeepSeek) or rely on specialized libraries (e.g., CUTLASS)-both of which add complexity and limit scalability for most ML practitioners.\n  This paper introduces a compilation scheme that automatically generates scalable, high-performance microkernels by leveraging the MLIR dialects to bridge domain-level operations and processor capabilities. Our approach removes dependence on low-level libraries by enabling the compiler to auto-generate near-optimal code directly. At its core is a mechanism for composing nanokernels from low-level IR constructs with near-optimal register utilization, forming efficient microkernels tailored to each target.

We develop an integrated location-inventory-grid model and employ a continuous approximation approach to overcome the intractability of discrete formulations. Our analysis compares centralized versus decentralized charging, with and without participation in frequency regulation. The results reveal that centralized charging, when combined with frequency regulation, not only reduces cost but also strengthens grid stability. However, it may constrain operational flexibility near the optimum, potentially challenging efforts to mitigate environmental impacts by lowering battery inventories.

Recent approaches attempt to estimate rewards for unlabeled datasets using a small set of expert demonstrations. However, these methods often assume that the similarity between a trajectory and an expert demonstration is positively correlated with the reward, which oversimplifies the underlying reward structure. We propose PROF, a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate and improve executable reward function codes from natural language descriptions and a single expert trajectory. We propose Reward Preference Ranking (RPR), a novel reward function quality assessment and ranking strategy without requiring environment interactions or RL training.

This study presents evidence supporting an instructor-governed feedback loop that converts concept-level assessment evidence into vetted micro-interventions. The adaptive learning algorithm contains three safeguards: adequacy as a hard guarantee of gap closure, attention as a budgeted constraint for time and redundancy, and diversity as protection against overfitting to a single resource. We formalize intervention assignment as a binary integer program with constraints for coverage, time, difficulty windows informed by ability estimates, prerequisites encoded by a concept matrix, and anti-redundancy enforced through diversity. Greedy selection serves low-richness and tight-latency regimes, gradient-based relaxation serves rich repositories, and a hybrid method transitions along a richness-latency frontier. In simulation and in an introductory physics deployment with one thousand two hundred four students, both solvers achieved full skill coverage for essentially all learners within bounded watch time. The gradient-based method reduced redundant coverage by approximately twelve percentage points relative to greedy and harmonized difficulty across slates, while greedy delivered comparable adequacy with lower computational cost in scarce settings. Slack variables localized missing content and supported targeted curation, sustaining sufficiency across subgroups. The result is a tractable and auditable controller that closes the diagnostic-pedagogical loop and delivers equitable, load-aware personalization at classroom scale.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6559\u5e08\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5b66\u4e60\u53cd\u9988\u5faa\u73af\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6982\u5ff5\u7ea7\u8bc4\u4f30\u751f\u6210\u7ecf\u8fc7\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u5fae\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5b66\u4e60\u8bca\u65ad\u7cbe\u51c6\u4f46\u5e72\u9884\u8584\u5f31\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f80\u5f80\u8bca\u65ad\u51c6\u786e\u4f46\u5e72\u9884\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u5e2e\u52a9\u65f6\u673a\u4e0d\u5f53\u6216\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u9700\u6c42\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u5c06\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bc1\u636e\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u6709\u6548\u5e72\u9884\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u4fdd\u969c\u673a\u5236\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1a\u5145\u5206\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u9884\u7b97\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4fdd\u62a4\u3002\u5c06\u5e72\u9884\u5206\u914d\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u5e26\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u6574\u6570\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u8d2a\u5a6a\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u68af\u5ea6\u677e\u5f1b\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e09\u79cd\u6c42\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u57281204\u540d\u5b66\u751f\u7684\u7269\u7406\u8bfe\u7a0b\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e24\u79cd\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u90fd\u80fd\u5728\u6709\u9650\u89c2\u770b\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u5b9e\u73b0\u51e0\u4e4e\u6240\u6709\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6280\u80fd\u8986\u76d6\u3002\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u8d2a\u5a6a\u65b9\u6cd5\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u7ea612%\u7684\u5197\u4f59\u8986\u76d6\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u96be\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\u4e0a\u66f4\u52a0\u5747\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u8ffd\u8e2a\u548c\u53ef\u5ba1\u8ba1\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u95ed\u5408\u8bca\u65ad-\u6559\u5b66\u5faa\u73af\uff0c\u5728\u8bfe\u5802\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u516c\u5e73\u4e14\u8d1f\u8f7d\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6559\u5b66\u3002"}}

The proposed SBP formulation is interpreted as the mean-field limit associated to the energy-optimal evolution of a particle governed by a stochastic differential equation (SDE) with nonlinear drift and reflecting boundary conditions, constrained to initial and terminal densities for its state. The resulting mean-field system consists of a nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation coupled with a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, subject to two-point boundary conditions in time and Neumann boundary conditions in space. Through the Hopf-Cole transformation, this nonlinear system is recast as a pair of forward-backward advection-diffusion equations, which are amenable to efficient numerical solution via standard finite element discretization. The weak formulation naturally enforces reflecting boundary conditions without requiring explicit particle-boundary collision detection, thus circumventing the computational difficulties inherent to particle-based methods in complex geometries. Numerical experiments on challenging 3D maze configurations demonstrate fast convergence, mass conservation, and validate the optimal controls computed through reflected SDE simulations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u859b\u5b9a\u8c14\u6865\u95ee\u9898\u7684PDE\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Hopf-Cole\u53d8\u6362\u5c06\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u9ad8\u6548\u6c42\u89e3\u7684\u524d\u5411-\u540e\u5411\u5bf9\u6d41\u6269\u6563\u65b9\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u4e2d\u7c92\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4f20\u7edf\u7c92\u5b50\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8fb9\u754c\u5904\u7406\u4e0a\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u859b\u5b9a\u8c14\u6865\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u968f\u673a\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u573a\u6781\u9650\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Hopf-Cole\u53d8\u6362\u5c06\u975e\u7ebf\u6027Fokker-Planck\u65b9\u7a0b\u548cHamilton-Jacobi-Bellman\u65b9\u7a0b\u7cfb\u7edf\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u524d\u5411-\u540e\u5411\u5bf9\u6d41\u6269\u6563\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6807\u51c6\u6709\u9650\u5143\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u503c\u6c42\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u590d\u67423D\u8ff7\u5bab\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0a\u7684\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5feb\u901f\u6536\u655b\u3001\u8d28\u91cf\u5b88\u6052\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u5c04SDE\u6a21\u62df\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u4e2d\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u663e\u5f0f\u7c92\u5b50-\u8fb9\u754c\u78b0\u649e\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u62c5\u3002"}}

This problem is interesting because LLMs often hallucinate when direct evidence to answer a question is lacking, and these effects become more pronounced in a network of interacting LLMs. The hallucination spreads, causing previously accurate LLMs to hallucinate. We study interacting LLMs and their hallucination by combining novel ideas of mean-field dynamics (MFD) from network science and the randomized utility model from economics to construct a useful generative model. We model the LLM with a latent state that indicates if it is truthful or not with respect to the ground truth, and extend a tractable analytical model considering an MFD to model the diffusion of information in a directed network of LLMs. To specify the probabilities that govern the dynamics of the MFD, we propose a randomized utility model. For a network of LLMs, where each LLM has two possible latent states, we posit sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of a fixed point and analyze the behavior of the fixed point in terms of the incentive (e.g., test-time compute) given to individual LLMs. We experimentally study and analyze the behavior of a network of $100$ open-source LLMs with respect to data heterogeneity, node capability, network structure, and sensitivity to framing on multiple semi-synthetic datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76LLM\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u5e7b\u89c9\u4f20\u64ad\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5e73\u5747\u573a\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u968f\u673a\u6548\u7528\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u6790LLM\u534f\u4f5c\u95ee\u7b54\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u6269\u6563\u548c\u5e7b\u89c9\u4f20\u64ad\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "LLM\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u76f4\u63a5\u8bc1\u636e\u65f6\u5bb9\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u6548\u5e94\u5728\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684LLM\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u66f4\u52a0\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u5e7b\u89c9\u4f1a\u4f20\u64ad\u5bfc\u81f4\u539f\u672c\u51c6\u786e\u7684LLM\u4e5f\u5f00\u59cb\u4ea7\u751f\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u7f51\u7edc\u79d1\u5b66\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u573a\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6548\u7528\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06LLM\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u72b6\u6001\uff08\u771f\u5b9e/\u5e7b\u89c9\uff09\u7684\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6709\u5411\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u6269\u6563\u3002", "result": "\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u4e24\u79cd\u6f5c\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u7684LLM\u7f51\u7edc\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u56fa\u5b9a\u70b9\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u548c\u552f\u4e00\u6027\u7684\u5145\u5206\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6fc0\u52b1\uff08\u5982\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\uff09\u5bf9\u56fa\u5b9a\u70b9\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u5728100\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90LLM\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3LLM\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u5e7b\u89c9\u4f20\u64ad\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u95ee\u7b54\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

We demonstrate that students benefit from softer probabilities early in training but require sharper probabilities in later stages. We introduce Dynamic Temperature Scheduler (DTS), which adjusts temperature dynamically based on the cross-entropy loss gap between teacher and student. To our knowledge, this is the first temperature scheduling method that adapts based on the divergence between teacher and student distributions. Our method integrates seamlessly with existing KD frameworks. We validate DTS across multiple KD strategies on vision (CIFAR-100, Tiny-ImageNet) and NLP tasks (GLUE, Dolly, SelfIns, UnNI, S-NI), consistently outperforming static-temperature baselines.

However, crafting satisfactory designs is time-intensive for designers: they need to consider which controls and content to present on the page, and then repeatedly adjust their size, position, and style for better aesthetics and structure. Although many design software can now help to perform these repetitive tasks, extensive training is needed to use them effectively. Moreover, collaborative design across app pages demands extra time to align standards and ensure consistent styling. In this work, we propose APD-agents, a large language model (LLM) driven multi-agent framework for automated page design in mobile applications. Our framework contains OrchestratorAgent, SemanticParserAgent, PrimaryLayoutAgent, TemplateRetrievalAgent, and RecursiveComponentAgent. Upon receiving the user's description of the page, the OrchestratorAgent can dynamically can direct other agents to accomplish users' design task. To be specific, the SemanticParserAgent is responsible for converting users' descriptions of page content into structured data. The PrimaryLayoutAgent can generate an initial coarse-grained layout of this page. The TemplateRetrievalAgent can fetch semantically relevant few-shot examples and enhance the quality of layout generation. Besides, a RecursiveComponentAgent can be used to decide how to recursively generate all the fine-grained sub-elements it contains for each element in the layout.

The International Maritime Organization (IMO) recently introduced the Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII) to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, further complicating deployment decisions. This paper introduces a novel two-stage stochastic programming model for long-term fleet deployment under market uncertainty and CII regulation. It is the first to integrate key operational uncertainties such as fuel prices, freight rates, and cargo demand into a unified tactical planning framework under CII regulation, simultaneously optimizing routing, cargo allocation, and speed. Furthermore, we develop an novel efficient heuristic algorithm that reliably converges to solutions within a 5\\% optimality gap, enabling practical decision-support under uncertainty. Numerical analysis highlights two key findings based on our model: (1) It uncovers the ``CII paradox,'' a critical counterintuitive phenomenon where the present Supply-based CII regulation may increase total emissions significantly and drastically reduce profits. This challenges the conventional wisdom that stricter carbon-intensity rules invariably reduce emissions.

Instead, we rely on an indirect style where learning algorithms, like gradient descent, determine a neural network's function by learning from data. This indirect style is often a virtue; it empowers us to solve problems that were previously impossible. But it lacks discrete structure. We can't compile most algorithms into a neural network -- even if these algorithms could help the network learn. This limitation occurs because discrete algorithms are not obviously differentiable, making them incompatible with the gradient-based learning algorithms that determine a neural network's function. To address this, we introduce $\\textsf{Cajal}$: a typed, higher-order and linear programming language intended to be a minimal vehicle for exploring a direct style of programming neural networks. We prove $\\textsf{Cajal}$ programs compile to linear neurons, allowing discrete algorithms to be expressed in a differentiable form compatible with gradient-based learning. With our implementation of $\\textsf{Cajal}$, we conduct several experiments where we link these linear neurons against other neural networks to determine part of their function prior to learning. Linking with these neurons allows networks to learn faster, with greater data-efficiency, and in a way that's easier to debug.

We present PRISM, a training-free framework that integrates refined system prompting, in-context learning (ICL), and a lightweight multi-agent system. Each component is examined extensively to reveal their synergies: prompt engineering provides precise task instructions, ICL supplies semantically relevant few-shot examples, and the multi-agent system models coordinated scoring behaviour. Our best configuration achieves an NDCG@5 of 0.71818 on the restricted validation split. We further demonstrate that PRISM is feasible and robust for production-scale financial retrieval.

Our analysis demonstrates that the Transformer architecture's particular algebraic form follows from these projection principles rather than being an arbitrary design choice.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ece\u5206\u5e03\u8bed\u4e49\u5b66\u89d2\u5ea6\u4e3a\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u6570\u5b66\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6e90\u4e8e\u5c06\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u7ea7\u5171\u73b0\u7edf\u8ba1\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u7279\u5b9a\u4ee3\u6570\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e0d\u662f\u4efb\u610f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u6e90\u4e8e\u5206\u5e03\u8bed\u4e49\u5b66\u539f\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u4eceGloVe\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u5171\u73b0\u77e9\u9635\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u6295\u5f71\u5982\u4f55\u81ea\u7136\u6355\u83b7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5f71\u54cd\uff0cquery-key-value\u673a\u5236\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u5411\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u591a\u5934\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u90fd\u662f\u540c\u4e00\u6295\u5f71\u539f\u7406\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7cbe\u5316\uff0c\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4ece\u8bed\u6599\u7ea7\u5171\u73b0\u7edf\u8ba1\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\u81ea\u7136\u6d8c\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u4ee3\u6570\u5f62\u5f0f\u9075\u5faa\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6295\u5f71\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4efb\u610f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u575a\u5b9e\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Recent research underscores the potential of harnessing large language models (LLMs) for VLN, given their commonsense knowledge and general reasoning capabilities. Despite their strengths, a substantial gap in task completion performance persists between LLM-based approaches and domain experts, as LLMs inherently struggle to comprehend real-world spatial correlations precisely. Additionally, introducing LLMs is accompanied with substantial computational cost and inference latency. To address these issues, we propose a novel dual-process thinking framework dubbed R3, integrating LLMs' generalization capabilities with VLN-specific expertise in a zero-shot manner. The framework comprises three core modules: Runner, Ruminator, and Regulator. The Runner is a lightweight transformer-based expert model that ensures efficient and accurate navigation under regular circumstances. The Ruminator employs a powerful multimodal LLM as the backbone and adopts chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to elicit structured reasoning. The Regulator monitors the navigation progress and controls the appropriate thinking mode according to three criteria, integrating Runner and Ruminator harmoniously. Experimental results illustrate that R3 significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, exceeding 3.28% and 3.30% in SPL and RGSPL respectively on the REVERIE benchmark. This pronounced enhancement highlights the effectiveness of our method in handling challenging VLN tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86R3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u5bfc\u822a\u4e13\u4e1a\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Runner\u3001Ruminator\u548cRegulator\u4e09\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u5bfc\u822a\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u5bfc\u822a\u4e2d\u7a7a\u95f4\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u7cbe\u786e\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5229\u7528LLM\u7684\u5e38\u8bc6\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u8fc7\u7a0b\u601d\u7ef4\u6846\u67b6\uff1aRunner\u8d1f\u8d23\u5e38\u89c4\u5bfc\u822a\uff0cRuminator\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001LLM\u8fdb\u884c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\uff0cRegulator\u6839\u636e\u4e09\u4e2a\u6807\u51c6\u63a7\u5236\u601d\u7ef4\u6a21\u5f0f\u5207\u6362\u3002", "result": "\u5728REVERIE\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cSPL\u548cRGSPL\u5206\u522b\u8d85\u8fc7\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f73\u65b9\u6cd53.28%\u548c3.30%\u3002", "conclusion": "R3\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u5bfc\u822a\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Error Feedback (EF) mechanisms are widely adopted to mitigate this issue of distributed compression algorithms. Despite their popularity and training efficiency, existing distributed EF algorithms often require prior knowledge of problem parameters (e.g., smoothness constants) to fine-tune stepsizes. This limits their practical applicability especially in large-scale neural network training. In this paper, we study normalized error feedback algorithms that combine EF with normalized updates, various momentum variants, and parameter-agnostic, time-varying stepsizes, thus eliminating the need for problem-dependent tuning. We analyze the convergence of these algorithms for minimizing smooth functions, and establish parameter-agnostic complexity bounds that are close to the best-known bounds with carefully-tuned problem-dependent stepsizes. Specifically, we show that normalized EF21 achieve the convergence rate of near ${O}(1/T^{1/4})$ for Polyak's heavy-ball momentum, ${O}(1/T^{2/7})$ for Iterative Gradient Transport (IGT), and ${O}(1/T^{1/3})$ for STORM and Hessian-corrected momentum.

Based on empirical evidence and causal analysis, we find that although introducing task-level information improves transferability, it is still hindered by task conflict. To address this issue, we propose a Task Conflict Calibration (TC$^2$) method to alleviate the impact of task conflict. Specifically, it first splits batches to create multiple SSL tasks, infusing task-level information. Next, it uses a factor extraction network to produce causal generative factors for all tasks and a weight extraction network to assign dedicated weights to each sample, employing data reconstruction, orthogonality, and sparsity to ensure effectiveness. Finally, TC$^2$ calibrates sample representations during SSL training and integrates into the pipeline via a two-stage bi-level optimization framework to boost the transferability of learned representations.

Through systematic analysis of 12 main benchmarks and empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art agents, we identify three fundamental limitations: (1) absence of cost-controlled evaluation leading to 50x cost variations for similar precision, (2) inadequate reliability assessment where agent performance drops from 60\\% (single run) to 25\\% (8-run consistency), and (3) missing multidimensional metrics for security, latency, and policy compliance. We propose \\textbf{CLEAR} (Cost, Latency, Efficacy, Assurance, Reliability), a holistic evaluation framework specifically designed for enterprise deployment. Evaluation of six leading agents on 300 enterprise tasks demonstrates that optimizing for accuracy alone yields agents 4.4-10.8x more expensive than cost-aware alternatives with comparable performance. Expert evaluation (N=15) confirms that CLEAR better predicts production success (correlation $\u03c1=0.83$) compared to accuracy-only evaluation ($\u03c1=0.41$).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faCLEAR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709AI\u4ee3\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u4efb\u52a1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u800c\u5ffd\u7565\u4f01\u4e1a\u90e8\u7f72\u5173\u952e\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6210\u672c\u6548\u7387\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u8fd0\u8425\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709AI\u4ee3\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u4e3b\u8981\u8bc4\u4f30\u4efb\u52a1\u5b8c\u6210\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u4f01\u4e1a\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u5982\u6210\u672c\u6548\u7387\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u8fd0\u8425\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u679012\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u63d0\u51faCLEAR\uff08\u6210\u672c\u3001\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u6548\u80fd\u3001\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff09\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u5728300\u4e2a\u4f01\u4e1a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f306\u4e2a\u9886\u5148\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4ec5\u4f18\u5316\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u6bd4\u6210\u672c\u611f\u77e5\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u8d354.4-10.8\u500d\u3002\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bc4\u4f30\u786e\u8ba4CLEAR\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u9884\u6d4b\u751f\u4ea7\u6210\u529f\uff08\u03c1=0.83 vs \u51c6\u786e\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u03c1=0.41\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "CLEAR\u6846\u67b6\u4e3aAI\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u4f01\u4e1a\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Most existing optimization models are highly tailored to a single hospital or department and rarely see practical use. We present a general framework and a corresponding mixed-integer programming (MIP) model for physician rostering that accommodates a wide variety of roster structures and constraints. The model is integrated into a web application with an advanced graphical user interface (GUI), allowing physicians to specify preferences and hospital staff to configure the MIP model to their roster requirements without any mathematical or technical background. This approach enables easy adaptation to different hospitals or departments and straightforward updates in response to structural changes, such as new duties or modified qualifications. The applicability and effectiveness of the framework are demonstrated using real-world data from three departments in different hospitals specializing in internal medicine, cardiology, and orthopedics/trauma surgery.

This study examines whether larger models can systematically jailbreak smaller ones - eliciting harmful or restricted behavior despite alignment safeguards. Using standardized adversarial tasks from JailbreakBench, we simulate over 6,000 multi-turn attacker-target exchanges across major LLM families and scales (0.6B-120B parameters), measuring both harm score and refusal behavior as indicators of adversarial potency and alignment integrity. Each interaction is evaluated through aggregated harm and refusal scores assigned by three independent LLM judges, providing a consistent, model-based measure of adversarial outcomes. Aggregating results across prompts, we find a strong and statistically significant correlation between mean harm and the logarithm of the attacker-to-target size ratio (Pearson r = 0.51, p < 0.001; Spearman rho = 0.52, p < 0.001), indicating that relative model size correlates with the likelihood and severity of harmful completions. Mean harm score variance is higher across attackers (0.18) than across targets (0.10), suggesting that attacker-side behavioral diversity contributes more to adversarial outcomes than target susceptibility. Attacker refusal frequency is strongly and negatively correlated with harm (rho = -0.93, p < 0.001), showing that attacker-side alignment mitigates harmful responses. These findings reveal that size asymmetry influences robustness and provide exploratory evidence for adversarial scaling patterns, motivating more controlled investigations into inter-model alignment and safety.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u8d8a\u72f1\u5c0f\u578b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u6bd4\u4f8b\u4e0e\u6709\u5bb3\u884c\u4e3a\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u5448\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u884c\u4e3a\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6bd4\u76ee\u6807\u6613\u53d7\u6027\u5bf9\u5bf9\u6297\u7ed3\u679c\u5f71\u54cd\u66f4\u5927\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740LLMs\u5728\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u589e\u591a\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e86\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u5982\u4f55\u968f\u89c4\u6a21\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u5426\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u8d8a\u72f1\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528JailbreakBench\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u5bf9\u6297\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u6a21\u62df6000\u591a\u6b21\u591a\u8f6e\u653b\u51fb\u8005-\u76ee\u6807\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u6db5\u76d60.6B-120B\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21LLM\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acbLLM\u8bc4\u59d4\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f24\u5bb3\u5206\u6570\u548c\u62d2\u7edd\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5e73\u5747\u4f24\u5bb3\u5206\u6570\u4e0e\u653b\u51fb\u8005-\u76ee\u6807\u5927\u5c0f\u6bd4\u4f8b\u7684\u5bf9\u6570\u5448\u5f3a\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff08Pearson r=0.51\uff09\uff0c\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u65b9\u884c\u4e3a\u65b9\u5dee\uff080.18\uff09\u5927\u4e8e\u76ee\u6807\u65b9\u5dee\uff080.10\uff09\uff0c\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u62d2\u7edd\u9891\u7387\u4e0e\u4f24\u5bb3\u5206\u6570\u5f3a\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173\uff08rho=-0.93\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u5f71\u54cd\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u65b9\u5bf9\u9f50\u80fd\u51cf\u8f7b\u6709\u5bb3\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u7f29\u653e\u6a21\u5f0f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u53d7\u63a7\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

At its core, an alternating architecture decouples the optimization by parameterizing the state, adjoint and topology fields with three distinct Fourier Neural Networks (FNNs). These networks are trained through a collaborative and stable alternating optimization scheme applicable to both self-adjoint and non-self-adjoint systems. The Ginzburg-Landau energy functional is incorporated into the topology network's loss function, acting as an intrinsic regularizer that promotes well-defined designs with smooth and distinct interfaces. By employing physics-informed losses derived from either variational principles or strong-form PDE residuals, the broad applicability of the APF-FNNs is demonstrated across a spectrum of 2D and 3D multi-physics benchmarks, including compliance minimization, eigenvalue maximization, and Stokes/Navier-Stokes flow optimization. The proposed APF-FNNs consistently yield high-performance and high-resolution topologies, establishing a powerful and versatile foundation for physics-driven computational design.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4ea4\u66ff\u76f8\u573a\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc(APF-FNNs)\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u7269\u7406\u9a71\u52a8\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u62d3\u6251\u4f18\u5316\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5206\u522b\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u72b6\u6001\u3001\u4f34\u968f\u548c\u62d3\u6251\u573a\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4ea4\u66ff\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u878d\u5165Ginzburg-Landau\u80fd\u91cf\u6cdb\u51fd\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u7269\u7406\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u62d3\u6251\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u3001\u7269\u7406\u9a71\u52a8\u4e14\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u6e05\u6670\u754c\u9762\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e09\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5206\u522b\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u72b6\u6001\u3001\u4f34\u968f\u548c\u62d3\u6251\u573a\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4ea4\u66ff\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u62d3\u6251\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u4e2d\u878d\u5165Ginzburg-Landau\u80fd\u91cf\u6cdb\u51fd\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u53d8\u5206\u539f\u7406\u6216\u5f3a\u5f62\u5f0fPDE\u6b8b\u5dee\u6784\u5efa\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u3002", "result": "\u57282D\u548c3D\u591a\u7269\u7406\u573a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u67d4\u5ea6\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u3001\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u6700\u5927\u5316\u548cStokes/Navier-Stokes\u6d41\u52a8\u4f18\u5316\uff0cAPF-FNNs\u59cb\u7ec8\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "APF-FNNs\u4e3a\u7269\u7406\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f3a\u5927\u4e14\u901a\u7528\u7684\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4e00\u81f4\u5730\u4ea7\u751f\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u3002"}}

Although the current post hoc explanation methods offer valuable insights into feature importance, they are inherently disconnected from the model training process, limiting their faithfulness and utility. In this work, we introduce a novel differentiable approach to global explainability by design, integrating feature importance estimation directly into model training. Central to our method is the ScoresActivation function, a feature-ranking mechanism embedded within the learning pipeline. This integration enables models to prioritize features according to their contribution to predictive performance in a differentiable and end-to-end trainable manner. Evaluations across benchmark datasets show that our approach yields globally faithful, stable feature rankings aligned with SHAP values and ground-truth feature importance, while maintaining high predictive performance. Moreover, feature scoring is 150 times faster than the classical SHAP method, requiring only 2 seconds during training compared to SHAP's 300 seconds for feature ranking in the same configuration. Our method also improves classification accuracy by 11.24% with 10 features (5 relevant) and 29.33% with 16 features (5 relevant, 11 irrelevant), demonstrating robustness to irrelevant inputs.

We test this fundamental question with a series of chronological ordering tasks with increasing complexities over facts the model already knows from pre-training. Our tasks cover (1) chronological ordering, (2) conditional sorting (filter, then order), and (3) anachronism detection. We evaluate GPT-4.1, Claude-3.7 Sonnet, with and without Extended Thinking (ET), and GPT-5 across multiple reasoning-effort settings. Across models, Exact match rate drops sharply as sequences lengthen even while rank correlations stay high as LLMs largely preserve local order but struggle to maintain a single globally consistent timeline. In conditional sorting, most failures stem from the filtering step rather than the ordering step, but GPT-5 and Claude-3.7 Sonnet with Extended Thinking outshine normal models significantly. Lastly, anachronism detection is found to be the easiest task for the LLMs but performance still declines with increasingly overlapping timelines or entities. Overall, our main contribution is showing that allocating explicit reasoning budget helps with chronological ordering with GPT-5 at medium/high reasoning effort achieving flawless ordering at all lengths and perfect conditional sorting (both self-filtered and given-subset), whereas low/minimal effort degrades with longer lists, mirroring earlier models. Our findings delineate limits of current LLMs on chronological tasks, providing insights into task complexity, and demonstrate scenarios in which reasoning helps.

We address this question by showing how the shape of Lyapunov comparison functions governs guaranteed decay for control affine systems. Using a windowed nominal exponential rate together with the endpoint cap induced by actuator limits, we establish a strict ordering: concave comparison functions strictly outperform linear and convex ones, and strict concavity is necessary to improve the best achievable global exponential rate under a fixed endpoint cap. We derive a computable lower bound on the required actuation level for a target nominal rate and show that only concave shaping can reduce this level under the endpoint cap. We then establish a feasibility-preserving acceleration result: whenever a margin exists on a sublevel set, a feasible linear comparison can be replaced by a concave one that preserves feasibility while strictly increasing the guaranteed windowed decay. Finally, we give a tunable rational concave factor with controlled slope that yields a constructive design and integrates with CLF QP, as illustrated by examples.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86Lyapunov\u51fd\u6570\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u8870\u51cf\u901f\u7387\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u51f9\u6027\u6bd4\u8f83\u51fd\u6570\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u51f8\u6027\u51fd\u6570\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u4e25\u683c\u51f9\u6027\u662f\u63d0\u9ad8\u5168\u5c40\u6307\u6570\u8870\u51cf\u901f\u7387\u7684\u5173\u952e\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0cLyapunov\u51fd\u6570\u8870\u51cf\u901f\u7387\u7684\u4e0a\u9650\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6bd4\u8f83\u51fd\u6570\u5f62\u72b6\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u63a7\u5236\u4eff\u5c04\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4fdd\u8bc1\u8870\u51cf\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u7a97\u53e3\u5316\u540d\u4e49\u6307\u6570\u8870\u51cf\u7387\u548c\u6267\u884c\u5668\u9650\u5236\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u7aef\u70b9\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e25\u683c\u6392\u5e8f\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u53ef\u8c03\u6709\u7406\u51f9\u56e0\u5b50\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u51f9\u6027\u6bd4\u8f83\u51fd\u6570\u4e25\u683c\u4f18\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u51f8\u6027\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u53ea\u6709\u51f9\u6027\u5f62\u72b6\u80fd\u5728\u7aef\u70b9\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u964d\u4f4e\u6240\u9700\u9a71\u52a8\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4fdd\u6301\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u51f9\u6027\u6bd4\u8f83\u51fd\u6570\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8Lyapunov\u51fd\u6570\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u8870\u51cf\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u63a7\u5236\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6784\u9020\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u4e0eCLF QP\u96c6\u6210\u7684\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

We identify a major bottleneck:the long-tail distribution of rollout lengths, where a small fraction of long generations dominates wall clock time and a complementary opportunity; the availability of historical rollouts that reveal stable prompt level patterns across training epochs. Motivated by these observations, we propose DAS, a Distribution Aware Speculative decoding framework that accelerates RL rollouts without altering model outputs. DAS integrates two key ideas: an adaptive, nonparametric drafter built from recent rollouts using an incrementally maintained suffix tree, and a length aware speculation policy that allocates more aggressive draft budgets to long trajectories that dominate makespan. This design exploits rollout history to sustain acceptance while balancing base and token level costs during decoding.

However, it frequently suffers from hallucination errors, especially under noisy acoustic conditions. Previous works to reduce hallucinations in Whisper-style ASR systems have primarily focused on audio preprocessing or post-processing of transcriptions to filter out erroneous content. However, modifications to the Whisper model itself remain largely unexplored to mitigate hallucinations directly. To address this challenge, we present a two-stage architecture that first enhances encoder robustness through Adaptive Layer Attention (ALA) and further suppresses hallucinations using a multi-objective knowledge distillation (KD) framework. In the first stage, ALA groups encoder layers into semantically coherent blocks via inter-layer correlation analysis. A learnable multi-head attention module then fuses these block representations, enabling the model to jointly exploit low- and high-level features for more robust encoding. In the second stage, our KD framework trains the student model on noisy audio to align its semantic and attention distributions with a teacher model processing clean inputs. Our experiments on noisy speech benchmarks show notable reductions in hallucinations and word error rates, while preserving performance on clean speech. Together, ALA and KD offer a principled strategy to improve Whisper's reliability under real-world noisy conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u67b6\u6784\u6765\u51cf\u5c11Whisper\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u9519\u8bef\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5c42\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u589e\u5f3a\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6291\u5236\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u8bed\u97f3\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5e7b\u89c9\u548c\u8bcd\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "Whisper\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u58f0\u5b66\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7ecf\u5e38\u51fa\u73b0\u5e7b\u89c9\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u97f3\u9891\u9884\u5904\u7406\u6216\u8f6c\u5f55\u540e\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u672c\u8eab\u7684\u4fee\u6539\u6765\u76f4\u63a5\u51cf\u8f7b\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8f83\u5c11\u3002", "method": "\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u67b6\u6784\uff1a1) \u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5c42\u6ce8\u610f\u529b(ALA)\u901a\u8fc7\u5c42\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5206\u6790\u5c06\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5c42\u5206\u7ec4\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u5757\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u591a\u5934\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u878d\u5408\u5757\u8868\u793a\uff1b2) \u591a\u76ee\u6807\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u97f3\u9891\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u5904\u7406\u5e72\u51c0\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u8bed\u97f3\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5e7b\u89c9\u548c\u8bcd\u9519\u8bef\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u5e72\u51c0\u8bed\u97f3\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "ALA\u548cKD\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u539f\u5219\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u6539\u5584Whisper\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u566a\u58f0\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

Traditional CIL methods, which do not leverage pre-trained models (PTMs), suffer from catastrophic forgetting (CF) due to the need to incrementally learn both feature representations and the classifier. The integration of PTMs into CIL has recently led to efficient approaches that treat the PTM as a fixed feature extractor combined with analytic classifiers, achieving state-of-the-art performance. However, they still face a major limitation: the inability to continually adapt feature representations to best suit the CIL tasks, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose AnaCP (Analytic Contrastive Projection), a novel method that preserves the efficiency of analytic classifiers while enabling incremental feature adaptation without gradient-based training, thereby eliminating the CF caused by gradient updates.

This task is crucial for enhancing user satisfaction and corporate profits. Existing recommendation models struggle with complex operation logic, diverse user preferences, and sensitive to suboptimal suggestions, limiting their applicability to IoT device operations. To address these issues, we propose DevPiolt, a LLM-based recommendation model for IoT device operations. Specifically, we first equip the LLM with fundamental domain knowledge of IoT operations via continual pre-training and multi-task fine-tuning. Then, we employ direct preference optimization to align the fine-tuned LLM with specific user preferences. Finally, we design a confidence-based exposure control mechanism to avoid negative user experiences from low-quality recommendations.

Forecasting of energy mix and energy use decades ahead is nontrivial.

We propose an alternative using tractable probabilistic models (TPMs), particularly sum-product networks (SPNs). These models enable exact, scalable inference of key quantities such as scenario likelihoods, marginals, and conditional probabilities, supporting robust scenario expansion and risk assessment.\n  This framework enables direct embedding of chance-constrained optimization into investment planning, enforcing safety or reliability with prescribed confidence levels.

Accurately forecasting regional Airbnb market trends can thus offer critical insights for policymakers and urban planners aiming to mitigate these impacts. This study proposes a novel time-series forecasting framework to predict three key Airbnb indicators -- Revenue, Reservation Days, and Number of Reservations -- at the regional level. Using a sliding-window approach, the model forecasts trends 1 to 3 months ahead. Unlike prior studies that focus on individual listings at fixed time points, our approach constructs regional representations by integrating listing features with external contextual factors such as urban accessibility and human mobility. We convert structured tabular data into prompt-based inputs for a Large Language Model (LLM), producing comprehensive regional embeddings. These embeddings are then fed into advanced time-series models (RNN, LSTM, Transformer) to better capture complex spatio-temporal dynamics. Experiments on Seoul's Airbnb dataset show that our method reduces both average RMSE and MAE by approximately 48% compared to conventional baselines, including traditional statistical and machine learning models.

We first consider the setting where the loss is non-smooth and the optimizer interacts with a private proxy oracle, which sends only private messages about a minibatch of gradients. In this setting, we show that expected running time $\u03a9(\\min\\{\\frac{\\sqrt{d}}{\u03b1^2}, \\frac{d}{\\log(1/\u03b1)}\\})$ is necessary to achieve $\u03b1$ excess risk on problems of dimension $d$ when $d \\geq 1/\u03b1^2$. Upper bounds via DP-SGD show these results are tight when $d>\\tilde\u03a9(1/\u03b1^4)$. We further show our lower bound can be strengthened to $\u03a9(\\min\\{\\frac{d}{\\bar{m}\u03b1^2}, \\frac{d}{\\log(1/\u03b1)} \\})$ for algorithms which use minibatches of size at most $\\bar{m} < \\sqrt{d}$. We next consider smooth losses, where we relax the private oracle assumption and give lower bounds under only the condition that the optimizer is private. Here, we lower bound the expected number of first order oracle calls by $\\tilde\u03a9\\big(\\frac{\\sqrt{d}}\u03b1 + \\min\\{\\frac{1}{\u03b1^2}, n\\}\\big)$, where $n$ is the size of the dataset. Modifications to existing algorithms show this bound is nearly tight. Compared to non-private lower bounds, our results show that differentially private optimizers pay a dimension dependent runtime penalty. Finally, as a natural extension of our proof technique, we show lower bounds in the non-smooth setting for optimizers interacting with information limited oracles. Specifically, if the proxy oracle transmits at most $\u0393$-bits of information about the gradients in the minibatch, then $\u03a9\\big(\\min\\{\\frac{d}{\u03b1^2\u0393}, \\frac{d}{\\log(1/\u03b1)}\\}\\big)$ oracle calls are needed.

Github Link provided: https://github.com/KaiChen9909/margnet", "summary": "In differentially private (DP) tabular data synthesis, the consensus is that statistical models are better than neural network (NN)-based methods. However, we argue that this conclusion is incomplete and overlooks the challenge of densely correlated datasets, where intricate dependencies can overwhelm statistical models. In such complex scenarios, neural networks are more suitable due to their capacity to fit complex distributions by learning directly from samples. Despite this potential, existing NN-based algorithms still suffer from significant limitations. We therefore propose MargNet, incorporating successful algorithmic designs of statistical models into neural networks. MargNet applies an adaptive marginal selection strategy and trains the neural networks to generate data that conforms to the selected marginals. On sparsely correlated datasets, our approach achieves utility close to the best statistical method while offering an average 7$\\times$ speedup over it. More importantly, on densely correlated datasets, MargNet establishes a new state-of-the-art, reducing fidelity error by up to 26\\% compared to the previous best.

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in complex reasoning tasks. Despite promising success, current LLM-based KGR methods still face two critical limitations. First, existing methods often extract reasoning paths indiscriminately, without assessing their different importance, which may introduce irrelevant noise that misleads LLMs. Second, while many methods leverage LLMs to dynamically explore potential reasoning paths, they require high retrieval demands and frequent LLM calls. To address these limitations, we propose PathMind, a novel framework designed to enhance faithful and interpretable reasoning by selectively guiding LLMs with important reasoning paths. Specifically, PathMind follows a \"Retrieve-Prioritize-Reason\" paradigm. First, it retrieves a query subgraph from KG through the retrieval module. Next, it introduces a path prioritization mechanism that identifies important reasoning paths using a semantic-aware path priority function, which simultaneously considers the accumulative cost and the estimated future cost for reaching the target. Finally, PathMind generates accurate and logically consistent responses via a dual-phase training strategy, including task-specific instruction tuning and path-wise preference alignment. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that PathMind consistently outperforms competitive baselines, particularly on complex reasoning tasks with fewer input tokens, by identifying essential reasoning paths.", "AI": {"tldr": "PathMind\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\"\u68c0\u7d22-\u4f18\u5148\u5316-\u63a8\u7406\"\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5f15\u5bfcLLMs\u4f7f\u7528\u91cd\u8981\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM-based\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u5c40\u9650\uff1a1) \u4e0d\u52a0\u533a\u5206\u5730\u63d0\u53d6\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5f15\u5165\u65e0\u5173\u566a\u58f0\u8bef\u5bfcLLMs\uff1b2) \u52a8\u6001\u63a2\u7d22\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u68c0\u7d22\u9700\u6c42\u548c\u9891\u7e41LLM\u8c03\u7528\u3002", "method": "PathMind\u91c7\u7528\"\u68c0\u7d22-\u4f18\u5148\u5316-\u63a8\u7406\"\u8303\u5f0f\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u68c0\u7d22\u67e5\u8be2\u5b50\u56fe\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u8def\u5f84\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u51fd\u6570\u8bc6\u522b\u91cd\u8981\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\uff08\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u7d2f\u79ef\u6210\u672c\u548c\u4f30\u8ba1\u672a\u6765\u6210\u672c\uff09\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18\u548c\u8def\u5f84\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\uff09\u751f\u6210\u51c6\u786e\u54cd\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cPathMind\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u7ade\u4e89\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u8f93\u5165token\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "PathMind\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5f15\u5bfcLLMs\u4f7f\u7528\u91cd\u8981\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u5fe0\u5b9e\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u63a8\u7406\u3002"}}

With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), LLM-driven agents have emerged as a promising paradigm for automating data analysis and insight discovery. However, existing data insight agents remain limited in several key aspects, often failing to deliver satisfactory results due to: (1) insufficient utilization of domain knowledge, (2) shallow analytical depth, and (3) error-prone code generation during insight generation. To address these issues, we propose DataSage, a novel multi-agent framework that incorporates three innovative features including external knowledge retrieval to enrich the analytical context, a multi-role debating mechanism to simulate diverse analytical perspectives and deepen analytical depth, and multi-path reasoning to improve the accuracy of the generated code and insights.

Learning on Graphs Conference 2025", "summary": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse applications, yet they remain limited by oversmoothing and poor performance on heterophilic graphs. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework that equips graphs with a complex-weighted structure, assigning each edge a complex number to drive a diffusion process that extends random walks into the complex domain. We prove that this diffusion is highly expressive: with appropriately chosen complex weights, any node-classification task can be solved in the steady state of a complex random walk. Building on this insight, we propose the Complex-Weighted Convolutional Network (CWCN), which learns suitable complex-weighted structures directly from data while enriching diffusion with learnable matrices and nonlinear activations. CWCN is simple to implement, requires no additional hyperparameters beyond those of standard GNNs, and achieves competitive performance on benchmark datasets. Our results demonstrate that complex-weighted diffusion provides a principled and general mechanism for enhancing GNN expressiveness, opening new avenues for models that are both theoretically grounded and practically effective.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u590d\u6742\u52a0\u6743\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3a\u8fb9\u5206\u914d\u590d\u6570\u6743\u91cd\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8fc7\u5e73\u6ed1\u548c\u5f02\u8d28\u56fe\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5b58\u5728\u8fc7\u5e73\u6ed1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u5f02\u8d28\u56fe\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u673a\u5236\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u590d\u6742\u52a0\u6743\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4e3a\u6bcf\u6761\u8fb9\u5206\u914d\u590d\u6570\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u5c06\u968f\u673a\u6e38\u8d70\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u590d\u6570\u57df\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u590d\u6742\u52a0\u6743\u5377\u79ef\u7f51\u7edc\uff08CWCN\uff09\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u5408\u9002\u7684\u590d\u6742\u52a0\u6743\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "CWCN\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u7b80\u5355\u6613\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u590d\u6742\u52a0\u6743\u6269\u6563\u4e3a\u589e\u5f3a\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

To examine this hypothesis, we systematically rephrased and perturbed a set of well-known CSPLib problems to preserve their structure while modifying their context and introducing misleading elements.

We systematically examine how varying BR from 0.2 to 5.0 affects RF performance across 39 heterogeneous regression datasets and 16 RF configurations, evaluating with repeated two-fold cross-validation and mean squared error. Our results demonstrate that tuning the BR can yield significant improvements over the default: the best setup relied on BR \\leq 1.0 for 24 datasets, BR > 1.0 for 15, and BR = 1.0 was optimal in 4 cases only. We establish a link between dataset characteristics and the preferred BR: datasets with strong global feature-target relationships favor higher BRs, while those with higher local target variance benefit from lower BRs. To further investigate this relationship, we conducted experiments on synthetic datasets with controlled noise levels. These experiments reproduce the observed bias-variance trade-off: in low-noise scenarios, higher BRs effectively reduce model bias, whereas in high-noise settings, lower BRs help reduce model variance.

This study examines how incorporating pluralistic values affects LLM behavior by systematically evaluating demographic variation and design parameters in the alignment pipeline. We collected alignment data from US and German participants (N = 1,095, 27,375 ratings) who rated LLM responses across five dimensions: Toxicity, Emotional Awareness (EA), Sensitivity, Stereotypical Bias, and Helpfulness. We fine-tuned multiple Large Language Models and Large Reasoning Models using preferences from different social groups while varying rating scales, disagreement handling methods, and optimization techniques. The results revealed systematic demographic effects: male participants rated responses 18% less toxic than female participants; conservative and Black participants rated responses 27.9% and 44% more emotionally aware than liberal and White participants, respectively. Models fine-tuned on group-specific preferences exhibited distinct behaviors. Technical design choices showed strong effects: the preservation of rater disagreement achieved roughly 53% greater toxicity reduction than majority voting, and 5-point scales yielded about 22% more reduction than binary formats; and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) consistently outperformed Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) in multi-value optimization.

We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness on tabletop robotic manipulation as a concrete application: the translator processes 10,047 PyBullet-generated scenes (3--10 objects) and outputs probabilistic predicates with calibrated confidences (overall F1=0.68). When embedded in the planner, the system achieves 94\\%/90\\%/88\\% success on Simple Stack, Deep Stack, and Clear+Stack benchmarks (90.7\\% average), exceeding the strongest POMDP baseline by 10--14 points while planning within 15\\,ms.

However, the optimization landscape for SAE training can be challenging due to correlations in the input data. We demonstrate that applying PCA Whitening to input activations -- a standard preprocessing technique in classical sparse coding -- improves SAE performance across multiple metrics. Through theoretical analysis and simulation, we show that whitening transforms the optimization landscape, making it more convex and easier to navigate. We evaluate both ReLU and Top-K SAEs across diverse model architectures, widths, and sparsity regimes. Empirical evaluation on SAEBench, a comprehensive benchmark for sparse autoencoders, reveals that whitening consistently improves interpretability metrics, including sparse probing accuracy and feature disentanglement, despite minor drops in reconstruction quality.

Yet converting unstructured educational materials, such as lecture notes and slides, into KGs that capture key pedagogical content remains difficult. We propose a framework for knowledge graph construction and refinement grounded in rate-distortion (RD) theory and optimal transport geometry. In the framework, lecture content is modeled as a metric-measure space, capturing semantic and relational structure, while candidate KGs are aligned using Fused Gromov-Wasserstein (FGW) couplings to quantify semantic distortion. The rate term, expressed via the size of KG, reflects complexity and compactness. Refinement operators (add, merge, split, remove, rewire) minimize the rate-distortion Lagrangian, yielding compact, information-preserving KGs. Our prototype applied to data science lectures yields interpretable RD curves and shows that MCQs generated from refined KGs consistently surpass those from raw notes on fifteen quality criteria.

Our approach proceeds in two stages. First, we introduce a semantically aware labeling algorithm that, given a generated SQL and a gold reference, assigns node-level correctness without over-penalizing structural containers or alias variation. Second, we represent each node with a rich set of schema-aware and lexical features - capturing identifier validity, alias resolution, type compatibility, ambiguity in scope, and typo signals - and train a supervised classifier to predict per-node error probabilities. We interpret these probabilities as calibrated uncertainty, enabling fine-grained diagnostics that pinpoint exactly where a query is likely to be wrong. Across multiple databases and datasets, our method substantially outperforms token log-probabilities: average AUC improves by +27.44% while maintaining robustness under cross-database evaluation. Beyond serving as an accuracy signal, node-level uncertainty supports targeted repair, human-in-the-loop review, and downstream selective execution.

In this work, we propose AutoTool, a novel graph-based framework that bypasses repeated LLM inference by exploiting a key empirical observation: tool usage inertia - the tendency of tool invocations to follow predictable sequential patterns. AutoTool constructs a directed graph from historical agent trajectories, where nodes represent tools and edges capture transition probabilities, effectively modeling the inertia in tool selection. It further integrates parameter-level information to refine tool input generation. By traversing this structured representation, AutoTool efficiently selects tools and their parameters with minimal reliance on LLM inference. Extensive experiments across diverse agent tasks demonstrate that AutoTool reduces inference costs by up to 30% while maintaining competitive task completion rates, offering a practical and scalable enhancement for inference-heavy frameworks.

However, inferring the network's graphical structure from data remains challenging. Bayesian structure learners approach this problem by inferring a posterior distribution over the possible directed acyclic graphs underlying the BN. The inference process often requires marginalizing over probability distributions, which is typically done using dynamic programming methods that restrict the set of possible parents for each node. Instead, we present a novel method that utilizes tractable probabilistic circuits to circumvent this restriction. This method utilizes a new learning routine that trains these circuits on both the original distribution and marginal queries. The architecture of probabilistic circuits then inherently allows for fast and exact marginalization on the learned distribution. We then show empirically that utilizing our method to answer marginals allows Bayesian structure learners to improve their performance compared to current methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u6982\u7387\u7535\u8def\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6539\u8fdb\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\u5b66\u4e60\u9700\u8981\u8fb9\u7f18\u5316\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\u9650\u5236\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u7236\u8282\u70b9\u96c6\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u6982\u7387\u7535\u8def\u6765\u89c4\u907f\u4f20\u7edf\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u4f8b\u7a0b\uff0c\u5728\u539f\u59cb\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u8fb9\u7f18\u67e5\u8be2\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7535\u8def\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7535\u8def\u67b6\u6784\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u56de\u7b54\u8fb9\u7f18\u67e5\u8be2\u80fd\u8ba9\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u7ed3\u6784\u5b66\u4e60\u5668\u76f8\u6bd4\u5f53\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6982\u7387\u7535\u8def\u4e3a\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u5316\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6539\u8fdb\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Our study investigates if perturbations needed to cause a misclassification and yet coax a certified model into issuing a deceptive, large robustness radius for a target class can still be made small and imperceptible.

Such cross-domain generalization of harmful behavior underscores the need for a deeper understanding of the algorithms, tasks, and datasets that induce emergent misalignment. In this work, we extend this study by demonstrating that emergent misalignment can also arise from narrow refusal unlearning in specific domains. We perform refusal unlearning on Cybersecurity and Safety concept, and evaluate EMA by monitoring refusal scores across seven responsible AI (RAI) domains, Cybersecurity, Safety, Toxicity, Bias, Sensitive Content, Medical/Legal, and Privacy. Our work shows that narrow domain unlearning can yield compliance responses for the targeted concept, however, it may also propagate EMA to unrelated domains. Among the two intervened concepts, Cybersecurity and Safety, we find that the safety concept can have larger EMA impact, i.e, causing lower refusal scores, across other unrelated domains such as bias. We observe this effect consistently across two model families, Mistral-7b-0.3v, and Qwen-7b-2.5. Further, we show that refusal unlearning augmented with cross-entropy loss function on a small set of retain data from the affected domains can largely, if not fully, restore alignment across the impacted domains while having lower refusal rate on the concept we perform unlearning on. To investigate the underlying causes of EMA, we analyze concept entanglements at the representation level via concept vectors. Our analysis reveals that concepts with higher representation similarity in earlier layers are more susceptible to EMA after intervention when the refusal stream is altered through targeted refusal unlearning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u62d2\u7edd\u9057\u5fd8\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u80fd\u5f15\u53d1\u65b0\u5174\u9519\u4f4d\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65e0\u5173\u9886\u57df\u4e5f\u4ea7\u751f\u6709\u5bb3\u54cd\u5e94\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u8868\u793a\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u7ea0\u7f20\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u65e9\u671f\u5c42\u8868\u793a\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u9ad8\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u5728\u5e72\u9884\u540e\u51fa\u73b0\u9519\u4f4d\u3002", "motivation": "\u5148\u524d\u5de5\u4f5c\u53d1\u73b0\u5fae\u8c03\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u4ee3\u7801\u6570\u636e\u4f1a\u89e6\u53d1\u65b0\u5174\u9519\u4f4d\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u65e0\u5173\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u4e5f\u4f1a\u751f\u6210\u6076\u610f\u54cd\u5e94\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u5f15\u53d1\u65b0\u5174\u9519\u4f4d\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u7a84\u57df\u62d2\u7edd\u9057\u5fd8\u5b66\u4e60\u662f\u5426\u4e5f\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u7c7b\u4f3c\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6982\u5ff5\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u62d2\u7edd\u9057\u5fd8\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76d1\u6d4b\u4e03\u4e2a\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efbAI\u9886\u57df\u7684\u62d2\u7edd\u5206\u6570\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b0\u5174\u9519\u4f4d\u3002\u5206\u6790\u6982\u5ff5\u5411\u91cf\u5728\u8868\u793a\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u7ea0\u7f20\uff0c\u5e76\u5c1d\u8bd5\u4f7f\u7528\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u5728\u53d7\u5f71\u54cd\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u4fdd\u7559\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u589e\u5f3a\u5b66\u4e60\u6765\u6062\u590d\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u7a84\u57df\u9057\u5fd8\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u6982\u5ff5\u4e0a\u4ea7\u751f\u5408\u89c4\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u5c06\u65b0\u5174\u9519\u4f4d\u4f20\u64ad\u5230\u65e0\u5173\u9886\u57df\u3002\u5b89\u5168\u6982\u5ff5\u5bf9\u5176\u4ed6\u9886\u57df\uff08\u5982\u504f\u89c1\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u5174\u9519\u4f4d\u5f71\u54cd\u66f4\u5927\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u73b0\u8c61\u5728Mistral-7b-0.3v\u548cQwen-7b-2.5\u4e24\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u4e2d\u4e00\u81f4\u51fa\u73b0\u3002\u589e\u5f3a\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u5927\u5e45\u6062\u590d\u53d7\u5f71\u54cd\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7a84\u57df\u62d2\u7edd\u9057\u5fd8\u5b66\u4e60\u4f1a\u5f15\u53d1\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u7684\u65b0\u5174\u9519\u4f4d\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u6982\u5ff5\u5728\u8868\u793a\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u7ea0\u7f20\u7a0b\u5ea6\u51b3\u5b9a\u4e86\u9519\u4f4d\u6613\u611f\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u4fdd\u7559\u6570\u636e\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u8fd9\u79cd\u9519\u4f4d\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

This paper introduces SmallML, a Bayesian transfer learning framework achieving enterprise-level prediction accuracy with datasets as small as 50-200 observations.\n  We develop a three-layer architecture integrating transfer learning, hierarchical Bayesian modeling, and conformal prediction. Layer 1 extracts informative priors from 22,673 public records using a SHAP-based procedure transferring knowledge from gradient boosting to logistic regression. Layer 2 implements hierarchical pooling across J=5-50 SMEs with adaptive shrinkage, balancing population patterns with entity-specific characteristics. Layer 3 provides conformal sets with finite-sample coverage guarantees P(y in C(x)) >= 1-alpha for distribution-free uncertainty quantification.\n  Validation on customer churn data demonstrates 96.7% +/- 4.2% AUC with 100 observations per business -- a +24.2 point improvement over independent logistic regression (72.5% +/- 8.1%), with p < 0.000001. Conformal prediction achieves 92% empirical coverage at 90% target. Training completes in 33 minutes on standard CPU hardware.

Exponential maps preserve geodesics but have stiff, radius-dependent Jacobians, while volume-preserving charts maintain densities but distort geodesic distances. Both approaches entangle curvature with model parameters, inflating gradient variance. In high-dimensional latent normalizing flows, the wrapped exponential prior can stretch radii far beyond the curvature scale, leading to poor test likelihoods and stiff solvers. We introduce Radial Compensation (RC), an information-geometric method that selects the base density in the tangent space so that the likelihood depends only on geodesic distance from a pole, decoupling parameter semantics from curvature. RC lets radial parameters retain their usual meaning in geodesic units, while the chart can be tuned as a numerical preconditioner. We extend RC to manifolds with known geodesic polar volume and show that RC is the only construction for geodesic-radial likelihoods with curvature-invariant Fisher information. We derive the Balanced-Exponential (bExp) chart family, balancing volume distortion and geodesic error. Under RC, all bExp settings preserve the same manifold density and Fisher information, with smaller dial values reducing gradient variance and flow cost. Empirically, RC yields stable generative models across densities, VAEs, flows on images and graphs, and protein models. RC improves likelihoods, restores clean geodesic radii, and prevents radius blow-ups in high-dimensional flows, making RC-bExp a robust default for likelihood-trained generative models on manifolds.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5f84\u5411\u8865\u507f(RC)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u5207\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f7f\u4f3c\u7136\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6d4b\u5730\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u89e3\u8026\u53c2\u6570\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u66f2\u7387\u3002RC\u8ba9\u5f84\u5411\u53c2\u6570\u4fdd\u6301\u6d4b\u5730\u5355\u4f4d\u7684\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u56fe\u8868\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6570\u503c\u9884\u5904\u7406\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u8c03\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5f2f\u66f2\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\uff0c\u6307\u6570\u6620\u5c04\u4fdd\u6301\u6d4b\u5730\u7ebf\u4f46\u5177\u6709\u521a\u6027\u7684\u534a\u5f84\u76f8\u5173\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u800c\u4f53\u79ef\u4fdd\u6301\u56fe\u8868\u4fdd\u6301\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f46\u626d\u66f2\u6d4b\u5730\u8ddd\u79bb\u3002\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u90fd\u5c06\u66f2\u7387\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u7ea0\u7f20\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5f84\u5411\u8865\u507f(RC)\u8fd9\u4e00\u4fe1\u606f\u51e0\u4f55\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u5207\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f7f\u4f3c\u7136\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6d4b\u5730\u8ddd\u79bb\u3002\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u5e73\u8861\u6307\u6570(bExp)\u56fe\u8868\u65cf\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u4f53\u79ef\u626d\u66f2\u548c\u6d4b\u5730\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "result": "RC\u5728\u6240\u6709\u5bc6\u5ea6\u3001VAE\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u56fe\u7684\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u53ca\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u90fd\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u3002RC\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4f3c\u7136\u5ea6\uff0c\u6062\u590d\u4e86\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u6d4b\u5730\u534a\u5f84\uff0c\u5e76\u9632\u6b62\u4e86\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6d41\u4e2d\u7684\u534a\u5f84\u7206\u70b8\u3002", "conclusion": "RC-bExp\u6210\u4e3a\u5728\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4f3c\u7136\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u9ed8\u8ba4\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u53c2\u6570\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u66f2\u7387\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6570\u503c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Traditional motion analysis systems are often expensive and intrusive, limiting their use in natural training environments. To address this limitation, we propose a machine learning-based multimodal framework that integrates wearable sensor data for simultaneous action recognition and stress estimation. Using a self-developed wrist-worn device equipped with an accelerometer and photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor, we collected synchronized motion and physiological data during real archery sessions. For motion recognition, we introduce a novel feature--Smoothed Differential Acceleration (SmoothDiff)--and employ a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to identify motion phases, achieving 96.8% accuracy and 95.9% F1-score. For stress estimation, we extract heart rate variability (HRV) features from PPG signals and apply a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier, achieving 80% accuracy in distinguishing high- and low-stress levels.

While existing approaches have made significant progress in learning medication representations, they suffer from two fundamental limitations: (i) treating medical entities as independent features without modeling their synergistic effects on medication selection; (ii) employing static causal relationships that fail to adapt to patient-specific contexts and health states. To address these challenges, we propose CafeMed, a framework that integrates dynamic causal reasoning with cross-modal attention for safe and accurate medication recommendation. CafeMed introduces two key components: the Causal Weight Generator (CWG) that transforms static causal effects into dynamic modulation weights based on individual patient states, and the Channel Harmonized Attention Refinement Module (CHARM) that captures complex interdependencies between diagnoses and procedures. This design enables CafeMed to model how different medical conditions jointly influence treatment decisions while maintaining medication safety constraints. Extensive experiments on MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets demonstrate that CafeMed significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving superior accuracy in medication prediction while maintaining the lower drug--drug interaction rates. Our results indicate that incorporating dynamic causal relationships and cross-modal synergies leads to more clinically-aligned and personalized medication recommendations.

During training, CFG stochastically alternates between conditional and null prompts to enable both conditional and unconditional generation. However, during sampling, CFG outputs both null and conditional prompts simultaneously, leading to inconsistent noise estimates between the training and sampling processes. To reduce this error, we propose CFG-EC, a versatile correction scheme augmentable to any CFG-based method by refining the unconditional noise predictions. CFG-EC actively realigns the unconditional noise error component to be orthogonal to the conditional error component. This corrective maneuver prevents interference between the two guidance components, thereby constraining the sampling error's upper bound and establishing more reliable guidance trajectories for high-fidelity image generation.

However, these studies primarily focus on variations in environmental layouts while overlooking the impact of changes in device configurations, such as bandwidth, the number of access points (APs), and the number of antennas used. Unlike environmental changes, variations in device configurations affect the dimensionality of channel state information (CSI), thereby compromising neural network usability. To address this issue, we propose Meta-SimGNN, a novel WiFi localization system that integrates graph neural networks with meta-learning to improve localization generalization and robustness. First, we introduce a fine-grained CSI graph construction scheme, where each AP is treated as a graph node, allowing for adaptability to changes in the number of APs. To structure the features of each node, we propose an amplitude-phase fusion method and a feature extraction method. The former utilizes both amplitude and phase to construct CSI images, enhancing data reliability, while the latter extracts dimension-consistent features to address variations in bandwidth and the number of antennas. Second, a similarity-guided meta-learning strategy is developed to enhance adaptability in diverse scenarios.

While offloading experts to host memory is a common solution, it introduces a severe I/O bottleneck over the PCIe bus, as the data-dependent nature of expert selection places these synchronous transfers directly on the critical path of execution, crippling performance.\n  This paper argues that the I/O bottleneck can be overcome by trading a small amount of cheap, on-device computation to hide the immense cost of data movement. We present MoE-SpeQ, a new inference system built on a novel co-design of speculative execution and expert offloading. MoE-SpeQ employs a small, on-device draft model to predict the sequence of required experts for future tokens. This foresight enables a runtime orchestrator to prefetch these experts from host memory, effectively overlapping the expensive I/O with useful computation and hiding the latency from the critical path. To maximize performance, an adaptive governor, guided by an Amortization Roofline Model, dynamically tunes the speculation strategy to the underlying hardware. Our evaluation on memory-constrained devices shows that for the Phi-MoE model, MoE-SpeQ achieves at most 2.34x speedup over the state-of-the-art offloading framework.

Training on collapsed single labels forces models to express false confidence on fundamentally ambiguous cases, creating a misalignment between model certainty and the diversity of human perception. We demonstrate empirically that soft-label training, which treats annotation distributions as ground truth, preserves epistemic uncertainty. Across both vision and NLP tasks, soft-label training achieves 32% lower KL divergence from human annotations and 61% stronger correlation between model and annotation entropy, while matching the accuracy of hard-label training.

The need for answering such \"when-if\" questions--how the timing of an event would change under a specified intervention--commonly arises in real-world settings with heterogeneous treatment adoption and confounding. To address these challenges, we propose Synthetic Survival Control (SSC) to estimate counterfactual hazard trajectories in a panel data setting where multiple units experience potentially different treatments over multiple periods. In such a setting, SSC estimates the counterfactual hazard trajectory for a unit of interest as a weighted combination of the observed trajectories from other units. To provide formal justification, we introduce a panel framework with a low-rank structure for causal survival analysis. Indeed, such a structure naturally arises under classical parametric survival models. Within this framework, for the causal estimand of interest, we establish identification and finite sample guarantees for SSC. We validate our approach using a multi-country clinical dataset of cancer treatment outcomes, where the staggered introduction of new therapies creates a quasi-experimental setting. Empirically, we find that access to novel treatments is associated with improved survival, as reflected by lower post-intervention hazard trajectories relative to their synthetic counterparts.

Existing multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approaches steer fairness by shaping reward through post hoc orchestrations, leaving no certifiable self-enforceable fairness that is immutable by individual agents at runtime. Contextualized within a setting where each agent shares resources with others, we address this shortcoming with a learning enabled optimization scheme among self-interested decision makers whose individual actions affect those of other agents. This extends the problem to a generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE) game-theoretic framework where we steer group policy to a safe and locally efficient equilibrium, so that no agent can improve its utility function by unilaterally changing its decisions. Fair-GNE models MARL as a constrained generalized Nash equilibrium-seeking (GNE) game, prescribing an ideal equitable collective equilibrium within the problem's natural fabric. Our hypothesis is rigorously evaluated in our custom-designed high-fidelity resuscitation simulator. Across all our numerical experiments, Fair-GNE achieves significant improvement in workload balance over fixed-penalty baselines (0.89 vs.\\ 0.33 JFI, $p < 0.01$) while maintaining 86\\% task success, demonstrating statistically significant fairness gains through adaptive constraint enforcement.

We proposed an automated Bias-Identification Framework to recognize various social biases in LLMs such as gender, race, profession, and religion.

However, mainstream Red Teaming methods rely on online generation and black-box output analysis. These approaches are not only costly but also suffer from feedback latency, making them unsuitable for agile diagnostics after training a new model. To address this, we propose N-GLARE (A Non-Generative, Latent Representation-Efficient LLM Safety Evaluator). N-GLARE operates entirely on the model's latent representations, bypassing the need for full text generation. It characterizes hidden layer dynamics by analyzing the APT (Angular-Probabilistic Trajectory) of latent representations and introducing the JSS (Jensen-Shannon Separability) metric. Experiments on over 40 models and 20 red teaming strategies demonstrate that the JSS metric exhibits high consistency with the safety rankings derived from Red Teaming.

While traditional ensemble prediction (EPS) addresses this through computationally intensive simulations, recent advances in Bayesian Deep Learning (BDL) offer a promising but often disconnected alternative. We bridge these paradigms through a unified hybrid Bayesian Deep Learning framework for ensemble weather forecasting that explicitly decomposes predictive uncertainty into epistemic and aleatoric components, learned via variational inference and a physics-informed stochastic perturbation scheme modeling flow-dependent atmospheric dynamics, respectively. We further establish a unified theoretical framework that rigorously connects BDL and EPS, providing formal theorems that decompose total predictive uncertainty into epistemic and aleatoric components under the hybrid BDL framework. We validate our framework on the large-scale 40-year ERA5 reanalysis dataset (1979-2019) with 0.25\u00b0 spatial resolution.

However, it remains challenging for world models to accurately replicate environments that are high-dimensional, non-stationary, and composed of multiple objects with rich interactions since most world models learn holistic representations of all environmental components. By contrast, humans perceive the environment by decomposing it into discrete objects, facilitating efficient decision-making. Motivated by this insight, we propose \\emph{Slot Transformer Imagination with CAusality-aware reinforcement learning} (STICA), a unified framework in which object-centric Transformers serve as the world model and causality-aware policy and value networks. STICA represents each observation as a set of object-centric tokens, together with tokens for the agent action and the resulting reward, enabling the world model to predict token-level dynamics and interactions. The policy and value networks then estimate token-level cause--effect relations and use them in the attention layers, yielding causality-guided decision-making.

Within this domain, short-term prediction of rapid behavioral changes in complex maritime environments has established multimodal trajectory prediction (MTP) as a promising research area. However, existing vessel MTP methods suffer from limited scenario applicability and insufficient explainability. To address these challenges, we propose a unified MTP framework incorporating explainable navigation intentions, which we classify into sustained and transient categories. Our method constructs sustained intention trees from historical trajectories and models dynamic transient intentions using a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE), while using a non-local attention mechanism to maintain global scenario consistency. Experiments on real Automatic Identification System (AIS) datasets demonstrates our method's broad applicability across diverse scenarios, achieving significant improvements in both ADE and FDE.

Recently, one-shot pruning has emerged as an effective strategy for reducing model size without additional training. However, models trained with standard objective functions often suffer a significant drop in accuracy after aggressive pruning. Some existing pruning-robust optimizers, such as SAM, and CrAM, mitigate this accuracy drop by guiding the model toward flatter regions of the parameter space, but they inevitably incur non-negligible additional computations. We propose a Variance Amplifying Regularizer (VAR) that deliberately increases the variance of model parameters during training.

Small, imbalanced, and noisy datasets, coupled with high-dimensional and weakly identified clinical features, amplify this multiplicity and make conventional validation schemes unreliable. As a result, selecting among equally performing models becomes uncertain, particularly when resource constraints and operational priorities are not considered by conventional metrics like F1 score. To address these issues, we propose two complementary tools for robust model assessment and selection: Intervention Efficiency (IE) and the Perturbation Validation Framework (PVF). IE is a capacity-aware metric that quantifies how efficiently a model identifies actionable true positives when only limited interventions are feasible, thereby linking predictive performance with clinical utility. PVF introduces a structured approach to assess the stability of models under data perturbations, identifying models whose performance remains most invariant across noisy or shifted validation sets.

The prevalent approach to handle this challenge is to aggregate a weighted combination of requirement violation penalties into the training objective. To be effective, this approach requires careful tuning of these hyperparameters (weights), involving trial-and-error and cross-validation, which becomes ineffective even for a moderate number of requirements. These issues are exacerbated when the requirements involve parities or equalities, as is the case in fairness and boundary value problems. An alternative technique uses constrained optimization to formulate these learning problems. Yet, existing approximation and generalization guarantees do not apply to problems involving equality constraints. In this work, we derive a generalization theory for equality-constrained statistical learning problems, showing that their solutions can be approximated using samples and rich parametrizations.

However, despite their foundational role, the hidden irreversibility implied by the Second Law of Thermodynamics is often neglected during training, leading to unphysical solutions or even training failures in conventional PINNs. In this paper, we identify this critical gap and introduce a simple, generalized, yet robust irreversibility-regularized strategy that enforces hidden physical laws as soft constraints during training. This approach ensures that the learned solutions consistently respect the intrinsic one-way nature of irreversible physical processes. Across a wide range of benchmarks spanning traveling wave propagation, steady combustion, ice melting, corrosion evolution, and crack propagation, we demonstrate that our regularization scheme reduces predictive errors by more than an order of magnitude, while requiring only minimal modification to existing PINN frameworks.

However, this distributed learning paradigm faces several security threats, particularly to its integrity, such as backdoor attacks that aim to inject malicious behavior during the local training steps of certain clients. We present the first analysis of the influence of LoRA on state-of-the-art backdoor attacks targeting model adaptation in FL. Specifically, we focus on backdoor lifespan, a critical characteristic in FL, that can vary depending on the attack scenario and the attacker's ability to effectively inject the backdoor. A key finding in our experiments is that for an optimally injected backdoor, the backdoor persistence after the attack is longer when the LoRA's rank is lower.

However, existing general-to-customized CMR methods typically assume that the entire target-domain data is available, which is easily violated in real-world scenarios and thus inevitably suffer from the query shift (QS) problem. Specifically, query shift embraces the following two characteristics and thus poses new challenges to CMR. i) Online Shift: real-world queries always arrive in an online manner, rendering it impractical to access the entire query set beforehand for customization approaches; ii) Diverse Shift: even with domain customization, the CMR models struggle to satisfy queries from diverse users or scenarios, leaving an urgent need to accommodate diverse queries. In this paper, we observe that QS would not only undermine the well-structured common space inherited from the source model, but also steer the model toward forgetting the indispensable general knowledge for CMR. Inspired by the observations, we propose a novel method for achieving online and harmonious adaptation against QS, dubbed Robust adaptation with quEry ShifT (REST). To deal with online shift, REST first refines the retrieval results to formulate the query predictions and accordingly designs a QS-robust objective function on these predictions to preserve the well-established common space in an online manner. As for tackling the more challenging diverse shift, REST employs a gradient decoupling module to dexterously manipulate the gradients during the adaptation process, thus preventing the CMR model from forgetting the general knowledge. Extensive experiments on 20 benchmarks across three CMR tasks verify the effectiveness of our method against QS.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faREST\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u4e2d\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5728\u7ebf\u504f\u79fb\u548c\u591a\u6837\u5316\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u67e5\u8be2\u9884\u6d4b\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u68af\u5ea6\u89e3\u8026\u6a21\u5757\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u9002\u5e94\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u901a\u7528\u5230\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u6570\u636e\u5b8c\u5168\u53ef\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u67e5\u8be2\u4ee5\u5728\u7ebf\u65b9\u5f0f\u5230\u8fbe\u4e14\u591a\u6837\u5316\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u67e5\u8be2\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7834\u574f\u516c\u5171\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u5e76\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u9057\u5fd8\u901a\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "method": "REST\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a1\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u67e5\u8be2\u9884\u6d4b\u5236\u5b9aQS\u9c81\u68d2\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u5728\u7ebf\u4fdd\u62a4\u516c\u5171\u7a7a\u95f4\uff1b2\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u68af\u5ea6\u89e3\u8026\u6a21\u5757\u5728\u9002\u5e94\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5de7\u5999\u64cd\u4f5c\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u6a21\u578b\u9057\u5fd8\u901a\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u768420\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5e94\u5bf9\u67e5\u8be2\u504f\u79fb\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "REST\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u4e2d\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u548c\u591a\u6837\u5316\u67e5\u8be2\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u516c\u5171\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u5e76\u9632\u6b62\u901a\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u9057\u5fd8\u3002"}}

This architecture enables high-throughput live-cell video microscopy for migration analysis, supporting routine quantification of autonomous motility with strong potential for clinical translation.

However, most of these models don't have the ability to change the number of atoms in the crystal during the generation process, which limits the variability of model sampling trajectories. In this paper, we demonstrate the severity of this restriction and introduce a simple yet powerful technique, mirage infusion, which enables diffusion models to change the state of the atoms that make up the crystal from existent to non-existent (mirage) and vice versa. We show that this technique improves model quality by up to $\\times2.5$ compared to the same model without this modification. The resulting model, Mirage Atom Diffusion (MiAD), is an equivariant joint diffusion model for de novo crystal generation that is capable of altering the number of atoms during the generation process. MiAD achieves an $8.2\\%$ S.U.N. rate on the MP-20 dataset, which substantially exceeds existing state-of-the-art approaches.

However, some fundamental cardiac biomarkers of interest, including stroke volume and cardiac output, require invasive measurements, e.g., arterial pressure waveforms (APW). As a non-invasive alternative, photoplethysmography (PPG) measurements are routinely collected in hospital settings. Unfortunately, the prediction of key cardiac biomarkers from PPG instead of APW remains an open challenge, further complicated by the scarcity of annotated PPG measurements. As a solution, we propose a hybrid approach that uses hemodynamic simulations and unlabeled clinical data to estimate cardiovascular biomarkers directly from PPG signals. Our hybrid model combines a conditional variational autoencoder trained on paired PPG-APW data with a conditional density estimator of cardiac biomarkers trained on labeled simulated APW segments. As a key result, our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach can detect fluctuations of cardiac output and stroke volume and outperform a supervised baseline in monitoring temporal changes in these biomarkers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8840\u6d41\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u76f4\u63a5\u4ecePPG\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f30\u8ba1\u5fc3\u8840\u7ba1\u751f\u7269\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u68c0\u6d4b\u5fc3\u8f93\u51fa\u91cf\u548c\u6bcf\u640f\u8f93\u51fa\u91cf\u7684\u6ce2\u52a8\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fde\u7eed\u5fc3\u8840\u7ba1\u76d1\u6d4b\u5728\u7cbe\u51c6\u5065\u5eb7\u4e2d\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u5173\u952e\u5fc3\u810f\u751f\u7269\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\u5982\u6bcf\u640f\u8f93\u51fa\u91cf\u548c\u5fc3\u8f93\u51fa\u91cf\u9700\u8981\u4fb5\u5165\u6027\u6d4b\u91cf\u3002PPG\u4f5c\u4e3a\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u6027\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u5b58\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u6311\u6218\u4e14\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u6761\u4ef6\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08\u5728\u914d\u5bf9\u7684PPG-APW\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff09\u548c\u6761\u4ef6\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff08\u5728\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u6a21\u62dfAPW\u6bb5\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff09\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u68c0\u6d4b\u5fc3\u8f93\u51fa\u91cf\u548c\u6bcf\u640f\u8f93\u51fa\u91cf\u7684\u6ce2\u52a8\uff0c\u5728\u76d1\u6d4b\u8fd9\u4e9b\u751f\u7269\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u76d1\u7763\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u4ecePPG\u4fe1\u53f7\u76f4\u63a5\u4f30\u8ba1\u5fc3\u8840\u7ba1\u751f\u7269\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

To bridge this gap, we develop nnterp, a lightweight wrapper around NNsight that provides a unified interface for transformer analysis while preserving original HuggingFace implementations. Through automatic module renaming and comprehensive validation testing, nnterp enables researchers to write intervention code once and deploy it across 50+ model variants spanning 16 architecture families. The library includes built-in implementations of common interpretability methods (logit lens, patchscope, activation steering) and provides direct access to attention probabilities for models that support it.

However, the inherent temporal heterogeneous induced by localized perturbations present significant challenges for generating structurally consistent time series. While flow matching provides a promising paradigm by modeling temporal dynamics through trajectory-level supervision, it fails to adequately capture abrupt transitions in perturbed time series, as the use of globally shared parameters constrains the velocity field to a unified representation. To address these limitations, we introduce \\textbf{PAFM}, a \\textbf{P}erturbation-\\textbf{A}ware \\textbf{F}low \\textbf{M}atching framework that models perturbed trajectories to ensure stable and structurally consistent time series generation. The framework incorporates perturbation-guided training to simulate localized disturbances and leverages a dual-path velocity field to capture trajectory deviations under perturbation, enabling refined modeling of perturbed behavior to enhance the structural coherence. In order to further improve sensitivity to trajectory perturbations while enhancing expressiveness, a mixture-of-experts decoder with flow routing dynamically allocates modeling capacity in response to different trajectory dynamics. Extensive experiments on both unconditional and conditional generation tasks demonstrate that PAFM consistently outperforms strong baselines.

Recent offloading systems migrate the KVCache to CPU memory and incorporate top-k attention to reduce the volume of data transferred from the CPU, while further applying system-level optimizations such as on-GPU caching and prefetching to lower transfer overhead. However, they overlook the CPU bottleneck in three aspects: (1) substantial overhead of fine-grained dynamic cache management performed on the CPU side, (2) significant transfer overhead from poor PCIe bandwidth utilization caused by heavy gathering operations at the CPU side, and (3) GPU runtime bubbles introduced by coarse-grained CPU-centric synchronization. To address these challenges, we propose CLO, a CPU-light KVCache offloading system via algorithm-system co-design. CLO features: (1) a coarse-grained head-wise approximate on-GPU caching strategy with negligible cache management cost, (2) seamless combination of data prefetching and on-GPU persistent caching for lower transfer overhead, (3) a zero-copy transfer engine to fully exploit PCIe bandwidth, and a GPU-centric synchronization method to eliminate GPU stalls. Evaluation on two widely-used LLMs demonstrates that CLO achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art systems, while substantially minimizing CPU overhead, fully utilizing PCIe bandwidth, thus improving decoding throughput by 9.3%-66.6%.

This heterogeneous structure presents significant challenges for existing diffusion-based imputation models, which typically assume a homogeneous feature space and rely on stochastic denoising trajectories. Such assumptions make it difficult to maintain conditional consistency, and they often lead to information collapse for categorical variables or instability when numerical variables require deterministic updates. These limitations indicate that a single diffusion process is insufficient for mixed-type tabular imputation.\n  We propose a hybrid deterministic diffusion framework that separates heterogeneous features into two complementary generative channels. A continuous DDIM-based channel provides efficient and stable deterministic denoising for numerical variables, while a discrete latent-path diffusion channel, inspired by loopholing-based discrete diffusion, models categorical and discrete features without leaving their valid sample manifolds. The two channels are trained under a unified conditional imputation objective, enabling coherent reconstruction of mixed-type incomplete data.\n  Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets show that the proposed framework achieves higher imputation accuracy, more stable sampling trajectories, and improved robustness across MCAR, MAR, and MNAR settings compared with existing diffusion-based and classical methods. These results demonstrate the importance of structure-aware diffusion processes for advancing deep learning approaches to incomplete tabular data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6269\u6563\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5f02\u6784\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u79bb\u4e3a\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u751f\u6210\u901a\u9053\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6df7\u5408\u7c7b\u578b\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7f3a\u5931\u503c\u586b\u8865\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u6570\u503c\u3001\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u79bb\u6563\u5c5e\u6027\u5171\u5b58\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u586b\u8865\u6a21\u578b\u5047\u8bbe\u540c\u8d28\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u6761\u4ef6\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5206\u7c7b\u53d8\u91cf\u4fe1\u606f\u5d29\u6e83\u6216\u6570\u503c\u53d8\u91cf\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8fde\u7eedDDIM\u901a\u9053\u5904\u7406\u6570\u503c\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u79bb\u6563\u6f5c\u8def\u5f84\u6269\u6563\u901a\u9053\u5904\u7406\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u79bb\u6563\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4e24\u4e2a\u901a\u9053\u5728\u7edf\u4e00\u6761\u4ef6\u586b\u8865\u76ee\u6807\u4e0b\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728MCAR\u3001MAR\u548cMNAR\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5747\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u9ad8\u586b\u8865\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u91c7\u6837\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u66f4\u597d\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u63a8\u8fdb\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u586b\u8865\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

Despite their progress, these models still face two major challenges. First, categorical sampling of discrete residue types collapses their continuous parameters into onehot assignments, while continuous variables (e.g., atom positions) evolve smoothly throughout the generation process. This mismatch disrupts the update dynamics and results in suboptimal performance. Second, current models assume unimodal distributions for side-chain torsion angles, which conflicts with the inherently multimodal nature of side chain rotameric states and limits prediction accuracy. To address these limitations, we introduce PepBFN, the first Bayesian flow network for full atom peptide design that directly models parameter distributions in fully continuous space. Specifically, PepBFN models discrete residue types by learning their continuous parameter distributions, enabling joint and smooth Bayesian updates with other continuous structural parameters. It further employs a novel Gaussian mixture based Bayesian flow to capture the multimodal side chain rotameric states and a Matrix Fisher based Riemannian flow to directly model residue orientations on the $\\mathrm{SO}(3)$ manifold. Together, these parameter distributions are progressively refined via Bayesian updates, yielding smooth and coherent peptide generation. Experiments on side chain packing, reverse folding, and binder design tasks demonstrate the strong potential of PepBFN in computational peptide design.", "AI": {"tldr": "PepBFN\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u5168\u539f\u5b50\u80bd\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6d41\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5b8c\u5168\u8fde\u7eed\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u76f4\u63a5\u5efa\u6a21\u53c2\u6570\u5206\u5e03\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u6269\u6563\u548c\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u80bd\u7ed3\u5408\u5242\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6269\u6563\u548c\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u578b\u9762\u4e34\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u95ee\u9898\uff1a1) \u79bb\u6563\u6b8b\u57fa\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u91c7\u6837\u4e0e\u8fde\u7eed\u53d8\u91cf\uff08\u5982\u539f\u5b50\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff09\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff1b2) \u4fa7\u94fe\u626d\u8f6c\u89d2\u7684\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u5e03\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0e\u4fa7\u94fe\u65cb\u8f6c\u5f02\u6784\u6001\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6027\u8d28\u76f8\u51b2\u7a81\u3002", "method": "PepBFN\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5b8c\u5168\u8fde\u7eed\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u76f4\u63a5\u5efa\u6a21\u53c2\u6570\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u9ad8\u65af\u6df7\u5408\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6d41\u6355\u6349\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4fa7\u94fe\u65cb\u8f6c\u5f02\u6784\u6001\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8eMatrix Fisher\u7684\u9ece\u66fc\u6d41\u76f4\u63a5\u5efa\u6a21SO(3)\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u7684\u6b8b\u57fa\u53d6\u5411\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4fa7\u94fe\u5806\u79ef\u3001\u53cd\u5411\u6298\u53e0\u548c\u7ed3\u5408\u5242\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86PepBFN\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u80bd\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "PepBFN\u901a\u8fc7\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u66f4\u65b0\u9010\u6b65\u7ec6\u5316\u53c2\u6570\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5e73\u6ed1\u4e14\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u80bd\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4e3a\u8ba1\u7b97\u80bd\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

We introduce ReflexGrad, a novel architecture that tightly couples three complementary mechanisms: (1) LLM-based hierarchical TODO decomposition for strategic planning, (2) history-aware causal reflection that analyzes recent action patterns to identify failure root causes and enable within-trial learning, and (3) gradient-based optimization for systematic improvement. Unlike prior work relying on few-shot demonstrations, our system achieves true zero-shot generalization through pure LLM semantic reasoning,requiring no task-specific examples, fine-tuning, or hardcoded similarity metrics. Evaluated on ALFWorld benchmark tasks, ReflexGrad demonstrates 67% zero-shot success rate on Trial 0 without any prior task experience or demonstrations, establishing effective performance on first exposure. Through empirical analysis, we identify the architectural mechanisms underlying stable convergence (zero action loops) and effective cross-task transfer (67% to 78% improvement).Our work demonstrates that synergistic integration of complementary learning mechanisms enables robust zero-shot generalization that approaches few-shot baselines from prior work.", "AI": {"tldr": "ReflexGrad\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u5c42\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u3001\u56e0\u679c\u53cd\u601d\u548c\u68af\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u4e09\u79cd\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728ALFWorld\u57fa\u51c6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a67%\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u6f14\u793a\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4ece\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u6839\u672c\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u4e92\u8865\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\u7684\u534f\u540c\u6574\u5408\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u4e09\u79cd\u673a\u5236\uff1a(1)\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u5206\u5c42TODO\u5206\u89e3\u8fdb\u884c\u6218\u7565\u89c4\u5212\uff0c(2)\u5386\u53f2\u611f\u77e5\u56e0\u679c\u53cd\u601d\u5206\u6790\u6700\u8fd1\u884c\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u5931\u8d25\u6839\u6e90\uff0c(3)\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "result": "\u5728ALFWorld\u57fa\u51c6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523067%\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4efb\u4f55\u5148\u9a8c\u4efb\u52a1\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6216\u6f14\u793a\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u80fd\u5728\u9996\u6b21\u63a5\u89e6\u65f6\u5efa\u7acb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e92\u8865\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\u7684\u534f\u540c\u6574\u5408\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u63a5\u8fd1\u5148\u524d\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u57fa\u7ebf\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Several Projection Quality Metrics (PQMs) have been developed as tools to quantify the goodness-of-fit of a DR projection; however, they mostly focus on measuring how well the projection captures the global or local structure of the data, without taking into account the visual distortion of the resulting plots, thus often ignoring the presence of outliers or artifacts that can mislead a visual analysis of the projection. In this work, we introduce the Warping Index (WI), a new metric for measuring the quality of DR projections onto the 2D plane, based on the assumption that the correct preservation of empty regions between points is of crucial importance towards a faithful visual representation of the data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Warping Index (WI)\u8fd9\u4e00\u65b0\u7684\u964d\u7ef4\u6295\u5f71\u8d28\u91cf\u5ea6\u91cf\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u6d4b\u91cf\u6295\u5f71\u4e2d\u7a7a\u533a\u57df\u4fdd\u6301\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u89c6\u89c9\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u8bef\u5bfc\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6295\u5f71\u8d28\u91cf\u5ea6\u91cf\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5168\u5c40\u6216\u5c40\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u4fdd\u6301\uff0c\u4f46\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u5931\u771f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u548c\u4f2a\u5f71\u53ef\u80fd\u8bef\u5bfc\u89c6\u89c9\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b63\u786e\u4fdd\u6301\u70b9\u95f4\u7a7a\u533a\u57df\u5bf9\u5fe0\u5b9e\u89c6\u89c9\u8868\u793a\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86Warping Index\u6307\u6807\u6765\u91cf\u53162D\u5e73\u9762\u964d\u7ef4\u6295\u5f71\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u6807\u51c6Warping Index\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u6295\u5f71\u4e2d\u7a7a\u533a\u57df\u7684\u4fdd\u6301\u8d28\u91cf\u8fdb\u884c\u91cf\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "Warping Index\u4e3a\u964d\u7ef4\u6295\u5f71\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u89c6\u89c9\u5931\u771f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u907f\u514d\u89c6\u89c9\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u7ed3\u8bba\u3002"}}

However, despite the abundance of \\textit{closed-vocabulary} models that are not pre-trained with language supervision, applying task arithmetic to these models remains unexplored. In this paper, we deploy and study task addition in closed-vocabulary image classification models. We consider different pre-training schemes and find that \\textit{weight disentanglement} -- the property enabling task arithmetic -- is a general consequence of pre-training, as it appears in different pre-trained closed-vocabulary models. In fact, we find that pre-trained closed-vocabulary vision transformers can also be edited with task arithmetic, achieving high task addition performance and enabling the efficient deployment of multi-task models. Finally, we demonstrate that simple linear probing is a competitive baseline to task addition.

Most existing models adopt either \\textbf{channel-independent} (CI) or \\textbf{channel-dependent} (CD) strategies, each presenting distinct drawbacks. CI methods fail to leverage the potential insights from inter-channel interactions, resulting in models that may not fully exploit the underlying statistical dependencies present in the data. Conversely, CD approaches often incorporate too much extraneous information, risking model overfitting and predictive inefficiency. To address these issues, we introduce the Adaptive Forecasting Transformer (\\textbf{Adapformer}), an advanced Transformer-based framework that merges the benefits of CI and CD methodologies through effective channel management. The core of Adapformer lies in its dual-stage encoder-decoder architecture, which includes the \\textbf{A}daptive \\textbf{C}hannel \\textbf{E}nhancer (\\textbf{ACE}) for enriching embedding processes and the \\textbf{A}daptive \\textbf{C}hannel \\textbf{F}orecaster (\\textbf{ACF}) for refining the predictions. ACE enhances token representations by selectively incorporating essential dependencies, while ACF streamlines the decoding process by focusing on the most relevant covariates, substantially reducing noise and redundancy.

The method, originally inspired by evolutionary game theory, differs from standard weighting schemes in that it is analytically tractable with provable convergence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u590d\u5236\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u5206\u914d\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u79bb\u6563\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u6743\u91cd\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5168\u5c40\u6536\u655b\u6027\u548c\u89e3\u6790\u53ef\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u548c\u79bb\u6563\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7279\u5f81\u6743\u91cd\u5206\u914d\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u6743\u91cd\u5206\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u548c\u6536\u655b\u6027\u8bc1\u660e\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u590d\u5236\u52a8\u6001\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u5355\u7eaf\u5f62\u4e0a\u6f14\u5316\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6570\u636e\u77e9\u9635\u8ba1\u7b97\u66f4\u65b0\u6307\u6570\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u7b97\u6cd5\u5e8f\u5217\u5168\u5c40\u6536\u655b\u5230\u552f\u4e00\u5185\u90e8\u5747\u8861\u70b9\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u975e\u9000\u5316\u7684\u6781\u9650\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e3a\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u5206\u914d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u89e3\u6790\u53ef\u8ffd\u8e2a\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u6743\u91cd\u5206\u914d\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}
