Drawing on recent work in\nphilosophy of neuroscience, we propose a comparison methodology based on the\nInter-Animal Transform Class (IATC) - the strictest set of functions needed to\naccurately map neural responses between subjects in an animal population. Using\nthe IATC, we can map bidirectionally between a candidate model's responses and\nbrain data, assessing how well the model can masquerade as a typical subject\nusing the same kinds of transforms needed to map across real subjects. We\nidentify the IATC in three settings: a simulated population of neural network\nmodels, a population of mouse subjects, and a population of human subjects. We\nfind that the IATC resolves detailed aspects of the neural mechanism, such as\nthe non-linear activation function. Most importantly, we find that the IATC\nenables accurate predictions of neural activity while also achieving high\nspecificity in mechanism identification, evidenced by its ability to separate\nresponse patterns from different brain areas while strongly aligning\nsame-brain-area responses between subjects. In other words, the IATC is a\nproof-by-existence that there is no inherent tradeoff between the neural\nengineering goal of high model-brain predictivity and the neuroscientific goal\nof identifying mechanistically accurate brain models.

It also introduces popular GeoML libraries such as TorchGeo,\neo-learn, and Raster Vision, detailing their architecture, supported data\ntypes, and integration with ML frameworks. Additionally, it discusses common\nmethodologies for data preprocessing, spatial--temporal joins, benchmarking,\nand the use of pretrained models. Through a case study in crop type mapping, it\ndemonstrates practical applications of these tools. Best practices in software\ndesign, licensing, and testing are highlighted, along with open challenges and\nfuture directions, particularly the rise of foundation models and the need for\ngovernance in open-source geospatial software. Our aim is to guide\npractitioners, developers, and researchers in navigating and contributing to\nthe rapidly evolving GeoML landscape."}

In this work, we aim to obtain the best out of both\nworlds by introducing a novel update rule that computes the target using the\nMINimum estimate between the Target and Online network, giving rise to our\nmethod, MINTO.

While there are some theoretical and primary\nempirical results showing the advantages of latent reasoning with looped\ntransformers or continuous chain-of-thoughts, continuous diffusion models\ntypically underperform their discrete counterparts. In this paper, we argue\nthat diffusion language models do not necessarily need to be in the discrete\nspace. In particular, we prove that continuous diffusion models have stronger\nexpressivity than discrete diffusions and looped transformers. We attribute the\ncontradiction between the theoretical expressiveness and empirical performance\nto their practical trainability: while continuous diffusion provides\nintermediate supervision that looped transformers lack, they introduce\nadditional difficulty decoding tokens into the discrete token space from the\ncontinuous representation space. We therefore propose Coevolutionary Continuous\nDiscrete Diffusion (CCDD), which defines a joint multimodal diffusion process\non the union of a continuous representation space and a discrete token space,\nleveraging a single model to simultaneously denoise in the joint space. By\ncombining two modalities, CCDD is expressive with rich semantics in the latent\nspace, as well as good trainability and sample quality with the help of\nexplicit discrete tokens. We also propose effective architectures and advanced\ntraining/sampling techniques for CCDD, which reveals strong empirical\nperformance in extensive language modeling experiments on real-world tasks."}

However, existing\nspatial interpolation methods-whether based on automatic weather station (AWS)\nmeasurements or enhanced with satellite/radar observations often over-smooth\ncritical structures, failing to capture sharp transitions and localized\nextremes. We introduce RainSeer, a structure-aware reconstruction framework\nthat reinterprets radar reflectivity as a physically grounded structural\nprior-capturing when, where, and how rain develops. This shift, however,\nintroduces two fundamental challenges: (i) translating high-resolution\nvolumetric radar fields into sparse point-wise rainfall observations, and (ii)\nbridging the physical disconnect between aloft hydro-meteors and ground-level\nprecipitation. RainSeer addresses these through a physics-informed two-stage\narchitecture: a Structure-to-Point Mapper performs spatial alignment by\nprojecting mesoscale radar structures into localized ground-level rainfall,\nthrough a bidirectional mapping, and a Geo-Aware Rain Decoder captures the\nsemantic transformation of hydro-meteors through descent, melting, and\nevaporation via a causal spatiotemporal attention mechanism.

Policy gradient methods, such\nas Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), are widely used in the context of\nautoregressive generation. However, the marginal likelihoods required for such\nmethods are intractable for diffusion models, leading to alternative proposals\nand relaxations. In this context, we unify variants of Rejection sAmpling based\nFine-Tuning (RAFT) as GRAFT, and show that this implicitly performs PPO with\nreshaped rewards. We then introduce P-GRAFT to shape distributions at\nintermediate noise levels and demonstrate empirically that this can lead to\nmore effective fine-tuning. We mathematically explain this via a bias-variance\ntradeoff. Motivated by this, we propose inverse noise correction to improve\nflow models without leveraging explicit rewards. We empirically evaluate our\nmethods on text-to-image(T2I) generation, layout generation, molecule\ngeneration and unconditional image generation. Notably, our framework, applied\nto Stable Diffusion 2, improves over policy gradient methods on popular T2I\nbenchmarks in terms of VQAScore and shows an $8.81\\%$ relative improvement over\nthe base model.

To pinpoint the research\nobjective and release researchers from saturated tasks, this paper focuses on a\nfundamental question: how to estimate the performance upper bound of deep time\nseries forecasting? Going beyond classical series-wise predictability metrics,\ne.g., ADF test, we realize that the forecasting performance is highly related\nto window-wise properties because of the sequence-to-sequence forecasting\nparadigm of deep time series models.

Recent advances in\ncomputational neuroscience have shown that learning in standard gradient\ndescent optimization formulation is not consistent with learning in biological\nsystems. This has opened up interesting avenues for building biologically\ninspired learning techniques. One such approach is inspired by Dale's law,\nwhich states that inhibitory and excitatory synapses do not swap roles during\nthe course of learning. The resulting exponential gradient descent optimization\nscheme leads to log-normally distributed synaptic weights. Interestingly, the\ndensity that satisfies the Fokker-Planck equation corresponding to the\nstochastic differential equation (SDE) with geometric Brownian motion (GBM) is\nthe log-normal density. Leveraging this connection, we start with the SDE\ngoverning geometric Brownian motion, and show that discretizing the\ncorresponding reverse-time SDE yields a multiplicative update rule, which\nsurprisingly, coincides with the sampling equivalent of the exponential\ngradient descent update founded on Dale's law. Furthermore, we propose a new\nformalism for multiplicative denoising score-matching, subsuming the loss\nfunction proposed by Hyvaerinen for non-negative data. Indeed, log-normally\ndistributed data is positive and the proposed score-matching formalism turns\nout to be a natural fit. This allows for training of score-based models for\nimage data and results in a novel multiplicative update scheme for sample\ngeneration starting from a log-normal density. Experimental results on MNIST,\nFashion MNIST, and Kuzushiji datasets demonstrate generative capability of the\nnew scheme.

This approach overlooks edge-level embedding\naugmentation and the interactions between node-level and edge-level embedding\naugmentations across various granularity. Moreover, they often treat all\ncontrastive sample pairs equally, neglecting the significant differences\nbetween hard and easy positive-negative sample pairs, which ultimately limits\ntheir discriminative capability. To tackle these issues, a novel robust\nattributed graph clustering (RAGC), incorporating hybrid-collaborative\naugmentation (HCA) and contrastive sample adaptive-differential awareness\n(CSADA), is proposed.

In particular, Conformal Prediction (CP) gains ground in\nthis field. For the case of time series, Online Conformal Prediction (OCP)\nbecomes an option to address the problem of data distribution shift over time.\nIndeed, the idea of OCP is to update a threshold of some quantity (whether the\nmiscoverage level or the quantile) based on the distribution observation. To\nevaluate the performance of OCP methods, two key aspects are typically\nconsidered: the coverage validity and the prediction interval width\nminimization. Recently, new OCP methods have emerged, offering long-run\ncoverage guarantees and producing more informative intervals. However, during\nthe threshold update step, most of these methods focus solely on the validity\nof the prediction intervals~--~that is, whether the ground truth falls inside\nor outside the interval~--~without accounting for their relevance. In this\npaper, we aim to leverage this overlooked aspect.

Our results suggest new\nguidelines for effectively exploiting privileged information, potentially\nadvancing the efficiency of policy learning across many practical partially\nobservable domains."}

Previous methods typically address this by\nmaintaining high policy entropy, yet the precise mechanisms that govern\nmeaningful exploration have remained underexplored. Our analysis suggests that\nan unselective focus on entropy risks amplifying irrelevant tokens and\ndestabilizing training. This paper investigates the exploration dynamics within\nRLVR and identifies a key issue: the gradual elimination of valuable\nlow-probability exploratory tokens, which we term \\textbf{\\textit{reasoning\nsparks}}. We find that while abundant in pre-trained models, these sparks are\nsystematically extinguished during RLVR due to over-penalization, leading to a\ndegeneracy in exploration. To address this, we introduce Low-probability\nRegularization (Lp-Reg). Its core mechanism regularizes the policy towards a\nheuristic proxy distribution. This proxy is constructed by filtering out\npresumed noise tokens and re-normalizing the distribution over the remaining\ncandidates. The result is a less-noisy proxy where the probability of\n\\textit{reasoning sparks} is amplified, which then serves as a soft\nregularization target to shield these valuable tokens from elimination via KL\ndivergence. Experiments show that Lp-Reg enables stable on-policy training for\naround 1,000 steps, a regime where baseline entropy-control methods collapse.\nThis sustained exploration leads to state-of-the-art performance, achieving a\n$60.17\\%$ average accuracy on five math benchmarks, an improvement of $2.66\\%$\nover prior methods.

This motivates principled designs\nin which the system itself includes built-in mechanisms to guard against such\nattacks. We propose a novel approach to limit the degree to which harmful\ndemonstrations can degrade model performance. First, we define a baseline\n``safe'' behavior for the model -- the model's performance given no in-context\ndemonstrations (zero-shot). Next, we apply distribution-free risk control\n(DFRC) to control the extent to which in-context samples can decay performance\nbelow zero-shot. We achieve this by leveraging dynamic early exit prediction,\nignoring later attention heads that attend the most to the unsafe inputs.\nFinally, we propose modifications to DFRC that allow it to both control risk\nfor harmful inputs \\textit{and} leverage performance and efficiency gains on\nhelpful inputs.

The activations of these attention heads,\ntermed function vectors, can be extracted and manipulated to alter an LMM's\nperformance on relational tasks. First, using both synthetic and real image\ndatasets, we apply causal mediation analysis to identify attention heads that\nstrongly influence relational predictions, and extract multimodal function\nvectors that improve zero-shot accuracy at inference time.

Prior work shows that increasing the number of samples K\nsteadily improves accuracy. In this paper, we demonstrate that this trend does\nnot hold indefinitely: at large K, further scaling yields no gains, and certain\nhard questions remain unsolved regardless of the number of traces.\nInterestingly, we find that different sampling temperatures solve different\nsubsets of problems, implying that single-temperature scaling explores only\npart of a model's potential. We therefore propose scaling along the temperature\ndimension, which enlarges the reasoning boundary of LLMs. Averaged over Qwen3\n(0.6B, 1.7B, 4B, 8B) and five representative reasoning benchmarks (AIME\n2024/2025, MATH500, LiveCodeBench, Hi-ToM), temperature scaling yields an\nadditional 7.3 points over single-temperature TTS. Temperature scaling also\nenables base models to reach performance comparable to reinforcement learning\n(RL)-trained counterparts, without additional post-training. We further provide\na comprehensive analysis of this phenomenon and design a multi-temperature\nvoting method that reduces the overhead of temperature scaling.

To\nbridge this gap, we propose ARMs, an adaptive red-teaming agent that\nsystematically conducts comprehensive risk assessments for VLMs. Given a target\nharmful behavior or risk definition, ARMs automatically optimizes diverse\nred-teaming strategies with reasoning-enhanced multi-step orchestration, to\neffectively elicit harmful outputs from target VLMs. We propose 11 novel\nmultimodal attack strategies, covering diverse adversarial patterns of VLMs\n(e.g., reasoning hijacking, contextual cloaking), and integrate 17 red-teaming\nalgorithms into ARMs via model context protocol (MCP). To balance the diversity\nand effectiveness of the attack, we design a layered memory with an\nepsilon-greedy attack exploration algorithm. Extensive experiments on instance-\nand policy-based benchmarks show that ARMs achieves SOTA attack success rates,\nexceeding baselines by an average of 52.1% and surpassing 90% on\nClaude-4-Sonnet.

In many cases, constraints are enforced via\nprojections, leading to projected stochastic gradient algorithms. In recent\nyears, a large body of work has examined the convergence properties of\nprojected SGD for non-convex losses in asymptotic and non-asymptotic settings.\nStrong quantitative guarantees are available for convergence measured via\nMoreau envelopes. However, these results cannot be compared directly with work\non unconstrained SGD, since the Moreau envelope construction changes the\ngradient. Other common measures based on gradient mappings have the limitation\nthat convergence can only be guaranteed if variance reduction methods, such as\nmini-batching, are employed. This paper presents an analysis of projected SGD\nfor non-convex losses over compact convex sets. Convergence is measured via the\ndistance of the gradient to the Goldstein subdifferential generated by the\nconstraints. Our proposed convergence criterion directly reduces to commonly\nused criteria in the unconstrained case, and we obtain convergence without\nrequiring variance reduction. We obtain results for data that are independent,\nidentically distributed (IID) or satisfy mixing conditions ($L$-mixing). In\nthese cases, we derive asymptotic convergence and $O(N^{-1/3})$ non-asymptotic\nbounds in expectation, where $N$ is the number of steps. In the case of IID\nsub-Gaussian data, we obtain almost-sure asymptotic convergence and\nhigh-probability non-asymptotic $O(N^{-1/5})$ bounds.
