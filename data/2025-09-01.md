Abstract: As the computer vision community advances autonomous driving algorithms,
integrating vision-based insights with sensor data remains essential for
improving perception, decision making, planning, prediction, simulation, and
control. Yet we must ask: Why don't we have entirely safe self-driving cars
yet? A key part of the answer lies in addressing novel scenarios, one of the
most critical barriers to real-world deployment. Our 2COOOL workshop provides a
dedicated forum for researchers and industry experts to push the state of the
art in novelty handling, including out-of-distribution hazard detection,
vision-language models for hazard understanding, new benchmarking and
methodologies, and safe autonomous driving practices. The 2nd Workshop on the
Challenge of Out-of-Label Hazards in Autonomous Driving (2COOOL) will be held
at the International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) 2025 in Honolulu,
Hawaii, on October 19, 2025. We aim to inspire the development of new
algorithms and systems for hazard avoidance, drawing on ideas from anomaly
detection, open-set recognition, open-vocabulary modeling, domain adaptation,
and related fields. Building on the success of its inaugural edition at the
Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV) 2025, the workshop
will feature a mix of academic and industry participation.

*Alireza Golkarieh,Kiana Kiashemshaki,Sajjad Rezvani Boroujeni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究评估了三种深度学习方法用于牙科X光片分类，混合CNN随机森林模型表现最佳，准确率85.4%，为自动化诊断提供实用路径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索深度学习在牙科全景X光片中自动化分类牙科病损的应用。

Method: 研究了三种方法：自定义卷积神经网络（CNN）、结合CNN特征提取与传统分类器的混合模型，以及微调的预训练架构。实验使用5折交叉验证，评估指标包括准确率、精确率、召回率和F1分数。

Result: 混合CNN随机森林模型表现最佳，准确率达85.4%，超过了自定义CNN基线（74.3%）。预训练模型中，VGG16表现最好（82.3%），其次是Xception和ResNet50。

Conclusion: 结合CNN特征提取与集成分类器的混合模型为自动化牙科诊断支持提供了实用路径，同时也表明需要更大数据集和进一步临床验证。

Abstract: This study investigates deep learning methods for automated classification of
dental conditions in panoramic X-ray images. A dataset of 1,512 radiographs
with 11,137 expert-verified annotations across four conditions fillings,
cavities, implants, and impacted teeth was used. After preprocessing and class
balancing, three approaches were evaluated: a custom convolutional neural
network (CNN), hybrid models combining CNN feature extraction with traditional
classifiers, and fine-tuned pre-trained architectures. Experiments employed 5
fold cross validation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score as
evaluation metrics. The hybrid CNN Random Forest model achieved the highest
performance with 85.4% accuracy, surpassing the custom CNN baseline of 74.3%.
Among pre-trained models, VGG16 performed best at 82.3% accuracy, followed by
Xception and ResNet50. Results show that hybrid models improve discrimination
of morphologically similar conditions and provide efficient, reliable
performance. These findings suggest that combining CNN-based feature extraction
with ensemble classifiers offers a practical path toward automated dental
diagnostic support, while also highlighting the need for larger datasets and
further clinical validation.

TL;DR: Q-Align通过Query-Query对齐、Key-Value重排和注意力细化，解决了零样本外观迁移中的注意力泄漏问题，并优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模图像生成模型在零样本外观迁移中因Query-Key对齐导致的注意力泄漏问题。

Method: 提出了Q-Align方法，包含三个核心贡献：Query-Query对齐、Key-Value重排和注意力细化。

Result: Q-Align在实验中表现出色，优于现有方法，同时保持了结构一致性。

Conclusion: Q-Align通过Query-Query对齐、Key-Value重排和注意力细化，有效解决了零样本外观迁移中的注意力泄漏问题，并在实验中表现出色，优于现有方法，同时保持了结构一致性。

Abstract: We observe that zero-shot appearance transfer with large-scale image
generation models faces a significant challenge: Attention Leakage. This
challenge arises when the semantic mapping between two images is captured by
the Query-Key alignment. To tackle this issue, we introduce Q-Align, utilizing
Query-Query alignment to mitigate attention leakage and improve the semantic
alignment in zero-shot appearance transfer. Q-Align incorporates three core
contributions: (1) Query-Query alignment, facilitating the sophisticated
spatial semantic mapping between two images; (2) Key-Value rearrangement,
enhancing feature correspondence through realignment; and (3) Attention
refinement using rearranged keys and values to maintain semantic consistency.
We validate the effectiveness of Q-Align through extensive experiments and
analysis, and Q-Align outperforms state-of-the-art methods in appearance
fidelity while maintaining competitive structure preservation.

### [4] [ERTACache: Error Rectification and Timesteps Adjustment for Efficient Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21091)
*Xurui Peng,Hong Liu,Chenqian Yan,Rui Ma,Fangmin Chen,Xing Wang,Zhihua Wu,Songwei Liu,Mingbao Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ERTACache通过纠正缓存误差，显著加速扩散模型推理，同时保持质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型的迭代推理过程带来大量计算开销，而现有的特征缓存策略在重用中间输出时会导致质量下降。

Method: ERTACache框架包含离线残差分析、动态调整积分区间和闭合形式残差线性化模型，以联合纠正特征偏移误差和步骤放大误差。

Result: 实验表明，ERTACache在标准图像和视频生成基准测试中实现了高达2倍的推理加速，同时保持或提升了视觉质量。

Conclusion: 本文通过提出ERTACache框架，有效地解决了扩散模型中缓存重用带来的累积误差问题，显著提升了推理速度，同时保持了甚至提升了视觉质量。

Abstract: Diffusion models suffer from substantial computational overhead due to their
inherently iterative inference process. While feature caching offers a
promising acceleration strategy by reusing intermediate outputs across
timesteps, naive reuse often incurs noticeable quality degradation. In this
work, we formally analyze the cumulative error introduced by caching and
decompose it into two principal components: feature shift error, caused by
inaccuracies in cached outputs, and step amplification error, which arises from
error propagation under fixed timestep schedules. To address these issues, we
propose ERTACache, a principled caching framework that jointly rectifies both
error types. Our method employs an offline residual profiling stage to identify
reusable steps, dynamically adjusts integration intervals via a
trajectory-aware correction coefficient, and analytically approximates
cache-induced errors through a closed-form residual linearization model.
Together, these components enable accurate and efficient sampling under
aggressive cache reuse. Extensive experiments across standard image and video
generation benchmarks show that ERTACache achieves up to 2x inference speedup
while consistently preserving or even improving visual quality. Notably, on the
state-of-the-art Wan2.1 video diffusion model, ERTACache delivers 2x
acceleration with minimal VBench degradation, effectively maintaining baseline
fidelity while significantly improving efficiency. The code is available at

### [5] [Video-LLMs with Temporal Visual Screening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21094)
*Zheyu Fan,Jiateng Liu,Yuji Zhang,Zihan Wang,Yi R.,Fung,Manling Li,Heng Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出TVS任务，通过时间视觉筛选优化视频语言理解，实验证明其显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在解决当前视频大型语言模型（Video-LLMs）在捕获细粒度时间语义方面的不足，受到认知科学原理的启发，提出TVS任务以优化推理负担和认知负载。

Method: 提出了一种新的任务Temporal Visual Screening (TVS)，通过对视频问答和指令调整数据进行预处理，保留关键视频片段，同步重构查询并保持答案一致性，将其作为模块化前端适配器任务集成到训练和推理流程中。

Result: 所提出的基线方法ReSimplifyIt在视频修剪任务中领先现有方法0.47 F-1分数，同时在查询重写任务中表现出色。实验显示，TVS在训练和推理阶段分别带来7.33%和34.6%的相对增益。

Conclusion: TVS作为一种时间视觉筛选任务，通过优化关键视频片段和查询表示，显著提升了视频语言理解的效果。实验证明，TVS在训练和推理阶段均能带来显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Humans naturally perform temporal screening by dragging the progress bar and
focusing on salient temporal segments, but current Video Large Language Models
(Video-LLMs) struggle to capture fine-grained temporal semantics due to sparse
frame sampling and insufficient inter-frame reasoning supervision during their
training. To address this, Inspired by well-established cognitive science
principles, we propose Temporal Visual Screening (TVS), a new task that
universally pre-processes video question answering and instruction tuning data
by: (1) retaining focus-critical video segments, (2) synchronously
reconstructing queries to their most direct form while preserving answer
consistency, and (3) keeping the invariance and consistency for any possible
answer. TVS is formulated as a modular front-end adapter task that can be
seamlessly integrated into both Video Instruction Tuning (training) and Video
Question Answering (inference) pipelines. TVS optimizes distribution of
reasoning burden and cognitive load; during training, it aligns queries with
focus-critical visual information; at inference, it enables query-aware segment
focus and streamlined query representations. In particular, we curate the first
benchmark for TVS and propose ReSimplifyIt, a baseline outperforming prior
approaches on seemingly similar tasks by 0.47 in F-1 score on video trimming
while achieving competitive query rewriting performance. Experiments
demonstrate that incorporating TVS yields relative gains of 7.33% (training)
and 34.6% (inference), demonstrating the effectiveness of temporal information
screening for improving video-language understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出骨骼姿态标注作为手术工具定位的高效方法，发布数据集ROBUST-MIPS及工具，验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的手术工具定位方法依赖于大量标注数据，但标注成本高。论文提出骨骼姿态标注作为一种更高效的替代方案。

Method: 论文提出了一个基于骨骼姿态标注的数据集ROBUST-MIPS，并通过简单的姿态估计基准测试验证其有效性。

Result: 实验表明，骨骼姿态标注在手术工具定位任务中表现优异，且数据集和工具的发布促进了方法的推广。

Conclusion: 通过提出的骨骼姿态标注方法，论文展示了其在手术工具定位中的高效性，并提供了数据集和工具以促进该方法的广泛应用。

Abstract: Localisation of surgical tools constitutes a foundational building block for
computer-assisted interventional technologies. Works in this field typically
focus on training deep learning models to perform segmentation tasks.
Performance of learning-based approaches is limited by the availability of
diverse annotated data. We argue that skeletal pose annotations are a more
efficient annotation approach for surgical tools, striking a balance between
richness of semantic information and ease of annotation, thus allowing for
accelerated growth of available annotated data. To encourage adoption of this
annotation style, we present, ROBUST-MIPS, a combined tool pose and tool
instance segmentation dataset derived from the existing ROBUST-MIS dataset. Our
enriched dataset facilitates the joint study of these two annotation styles and
allow head-to-head comparison on various downstream tasks. To demonstrate the
adequacy of pose annotations for surgical tool localisation, we set up a simple
benchmark using popular pose estimation methods and observe high-quality
results. To ease adoption, together with the dataset, we release our benchmark
models and custom tool pose annotation software.

### [7] [Safe-Control: A Safety Patch for Mitigating Unsafe Content in Text-to-Image Generation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21099)
*Xiangtao Meng,Yingkai Dong,Ning Yu,Li Wang,Zheng Li,Shanqing Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Safe-Control是一个创新的即插即用安全补丁，旨在减少T2I模型中不安全内容的生成，通过数据驱动策略和安全感知条件，显著优于现有安全机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有T2I模型的安全机制易受分布偏移影响或需要大量模型调整，无法有效防止不安全内容生成。

Method: Safe-Control通过在锁定T2I模型中注入安全控制信号，以类似于补丁的方式工作，支持灵活合并多种安全补丁。

Result: 在六个不同T2I模型上验证表明，Safe-Control将不安全内容生成概率降至7%，远超基线方法的20%，同时保持良性图像质量。

Conclusion: Safe-Control作为一种即插即用解决方案，有效提升T2I模型的安全性，适用于类似降噪架构的其他模型。

Abstract: Despite the advancements in Text-to-Image (T2I) generation models, their
potential for misuse or even abuse raises serious safety concerns. Model
developers have made tremendous efforts to introduce safety mechanisms that can
address these concerns in T2I models. However, the existing safety mechanisms,
whether external or internal, either remain susceptible to evasion under
distribution shifts or require extensive model-specific adjustments. To address
these limitations, we introduce Safe-Control, an innovative plug-and-play
safety patch designed to mitigate unsafe content generation in T2I models.
Using data-driven strategies and safety-aware conditions, Safe-Control injects
safety control signals into the locked T2I model, acting as an update in a
patch-like manner. Model developers can also construct various safety patches
to meet the evolving safety requirements, which can be flexibly merged into a
single, unified patch. Its plug-and-play design further ensures adaptability,
making it compatible with other T2I models of similar denoising architecture.
We conduct extensive evaluations on six diverse and public T2I models.
Empirical results highlight that Safe-Control is effective in reducing unsafe
content generation across six diverse T2I models with similar generative
architectures, yet it successfully maintains the quality and text alignment of
benign images. Compared to seven state-of-the-art safety mechanisms, including
both external and internal defenses, Safe-Control significantly outperforms all
baselines in reducing unsafe content generation. For example, it reduces the
probability of unsafe content generation to 7%, compared to approximately 20%
for most baseline methods, under both unsafe prompts and the latest adversarial
attacks.

*Kei Katsumata,Yui Iioka,Naoki Hosomi,Teruhisa Misu,Kentaro Yamada,Komei Sugiura*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GENNAV 解决了目标区域定位中的模糊边界和多目标问题，表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理模糊边界的物体类型目标区域时表现不佳，且在目标缺失或多目标情况下效果有限。

Method: 提出 GENNAV 方法，预测目标存在性并为多个物体类型目标区域生成分割掩码。

Result: GENNAV 在标准评估指标上优于基线方法，并在真实世界实验中展示了跨环境的性能。

Conclusion: GENNAV 在零样本迁移实验中表现出色，验证了其在多样化现实环境中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: We focus on the task of identifying the location of target regions from a
natural language instruction and a front camera image captured by a mobility.
This task is challenging because it requires both existence prediction and
segmentation, particularly for stuff-type target regions with ambiguous
boundaries. Existing methods often underperform in handling stuff-type target
regions, in addition to absent or multiple targets. To overcome these
limitations, we propose GENNAV, which predicts target existence and generates
segmentation masks for multiple stuff-type target regions. To evaluate GENNAV,
we constructed a novel benchmark called GRiN-Drive, which includes three
distinct types of samples: no-target, single-target, and multi-target. GENNAV
achieved superior performance over baseline methods on standard evaluation
metrics. Furthermore, we conducted real-world experiments with four automobiles
operated in five geographically distinct urban areas to validate its zero-shot
transfer performance. In these experiments, GENNAV outperformed baseline
methods and demonstrated its robustness across diverse real-world environments.

### [9] [R-4B: Incentivizing General-Purpose Auto-Thinking Capability in MLLMs via Bi-Mode Annealing and Reinforce Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21113)
*Jie Jiang,Qi Yang,Bolin Ni,Shiming Xiang,Han Hu,Houwen Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: R-4B是一种自适应思考的MLLM，通过双模式训练优化推理效率，性能优越且计算成本低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MLLMs在简单问题上冗余思考的低效问题。

Method: 采用双模式退火和Bi-mode Policy Optimization (BPO)训练模型，通过改进的GRPO框架优化策略模型。

Result: R-4B在25个挑战性基准测试中表现优异，优于Qwen2.5-VL-7B，并与更大模型如Kimi-VL-A3B-Thinking-2506性能相当。

Conclusion: R-4B通过自适应思考机制，在保证性能的同时降低了计算成本，为复杂推理和简单问题提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) equipped with step-by-step thinking
capabilities have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex reasoning
problems. However, this thinking process is redundant for simple problems
solvable without complex reasoning. To address this inefficiency, we propose
R-4B, an auto-thinking MLLM, which can adaptively decide when to think based on
problem complexity. The central idea of R-4B is to empower the model with both
thinking and non-thinking capabilities using bi-mode annealing, and apply
Bi-mode Policy Optimization~(BPO) to improve the model's accuracy in
determining whether to activate the thinking process. Specifically, we first
train the model on a carefully curated dataset spanning various topics, which
contains samples from both thinking and non-thinking modes. Then it undergoes a
second phase of training under an improved GRPO framework, where the policy
model is forced to generate responses from both modes for each input query.
Experimental results show that R-4B achieves state-of-the-art performance
across 25 challenging benchmarks. It outperforms Qwen2.5-VL-7B in most tasks
and achieves performance comparable to larger models such as
Kimi-VL-A3B-Thinking-2506 (16B) on reasoning-intensive benchmarks with lower
computational cost.

*Harris Song,Tuan-Anh Vu,Sanjith Menon,Sriram Narasimhan,M. Khalid Jawed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出HiddenObject，一种融合RGB、热成像与深度数据的Mamba-based方法，显著提升了复杂场景中的隐蔽目标检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RGB检测方法在遮挡、伪装和光线变化等恶劣条件下性能受限，因此需要更鲁棒且模态无关的方法。

Method: 论文提出了一种名为HiddenObject的融合框架，通过Mamba-based的融合机制将RGB、热成像和深度数据结合起来，提取模态特定特征并融合为统一表示。

Result: 实验验证表明，HiddenObject在多个基准数据集上达到了最先进或具有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: 该论文的结论表明，基于Mamba的融合架构可以显著推动多模态物体检测领域的发展，尤其是在视觉退化或复杂条件下。

Abstract: Detecting hidden or partially concealed objects remains a fundamental
challenge in multimodal environments, where factors like occlusion, camouflage,
and lighting variations significantly hinder performance. Traditional RGB-based
detection methods often fail under such adverse conditions, motivating the need
for more robust, modality-agnostic approaches. In this work, we present
HiddenObject, a fusion framework that integrates RGB, thermal, and depth data
using a Mamba-based fusion mechanism. Our method captures complementary signals
across modalities, enabling enhanced detection of obscured or camouflaged
targets. Specifically, the proposed approach identifies modality-specific
features and fuses them in a unified representation that generalizes well
across challenging scenarios. We validate HiddenObject across multiple
benchmark datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art or competitive performance
compared to existing methods. These results highlight the efficacy of our
fusion design and expose key limitations in current unimodal and na\"ive fusion
strategies. More broadly, our findings suggest that Mamba-based fusion
architectures can significantly advance the field of multimodal object
detection, especially under visually degraded or complex conditions.

*Ao Shen,Xueming Fu,Junfeng Jiang,Qiang Zeng,Ye Tang,Zhengming Chen,Luming Nong,Feng Wang,S. Kevin Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RadGS-Reg 是一个新的 CT/X 射线注册框架，通过联合 3D 重建和注册解决了传统方法的局限性，并在实验中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法因空间信息丢失和域差距而受限，现有 3D 重建方法对密集视图有要求且难以处理噪声大的 X 射线，因此需要一种新的方法来提升 CT/X 射线注册的准确性和效率。

Method: 提出了 RadGS-Reg 框架，结合了基于学习的 RadGS 重建方法（包含 Counterfactual Attention Learning 机制）和患者特定的预训练策略，逐步从模拟数据适应到真实数据。

Result: 实验结果表明，RadGS-Reg 在脊椎级别的 CT/X 射线注册任务中优于现有方法，达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: RadGS-Reg 在 CT/X 射线注册任务中表现出色，通过联合 3D Radiative Gaussians 重建和 3D/3D 注册，显著提升了准确性和实时性能，实验验证了其在内部数据集上的最佳性能。

Abstract: Computed Tomography (CT)/X-ray registration in image-guided navigation
remains challenging because of its stringent requirements for high accuracy and
real-time performance. Traditional "render and compare" methods, relying on
iterative projection and comparison, suffer from spatial information loss and
domain gap. 3D reconstruction from biplanar X-rays supplements spatial and
shape information for 2D/3D registration, but current methods are limited by
dense-view requirements and struggles with noisy X-rays. To address these
limitations, we introduce RadGS-Reg, a novel framework for vertebral-level
CT/X-ray registration through joint 3D Radiative Gaussians (RadGS)
reconstruction and 3D/3D registration. Specifically, our biplanar X-rays
vertebral RadGS reconstruction module explores learning-based RadGS
reconstruction method with a Counterfactual Attention Learning (CAL) mechanism,
focusing on vertebral regions in noisy X-rays. Additionally, a patient-specific
pre-training strategy progressively adapts the RadGS-Reg from simulated to real
data while simultaneously learning vertebral shape prior knowledge. Experiments
on in-house datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance for both
tasks, surpassing existing methods. The code is available at:

TL;DR: SYNBUILD-3D是一个多模态合成3D建筑数据集，填补了公共领域中大规模3D建筑数据集的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏大规模公开标注的3D建筑数据集，准确且语义丰富的3D建筑自动生成仍然是一个挑战。

Method: 作者构建了一个包含620万个合成3D住宅建筑的数据集，每个建筑通过三种模态表示：LoD 4的3D线框图、对应的平面图图像和类似LiDAR的屋顶点云。语义标注来源于平面图图像。

Conclusion: SYNBUILD-3D是一个大规模、多模态的合成3D住宅建筑数据集，有望推动自动化生成高细节（LoD 4）3D建筑模型的算法发展。

Abstract: 3D building models are critical for applications in architecture, energy
simulation, and navigation. Yet, generating accurate and semantically rich 3D
buildings automatically remains a major challenge due to the lack of
large-scale annotated datasets in the public domain. Inspired by the success of
synthetic data in computer vision, we introduce SYNBUILD-3D, a large, diverse,
and multi-modal dataset of over 6.2 million synthetic 3D residential buildings
at Level of Detail (LoD) 4. In the dataset, each building is represented
through three distinct modalities: a semantically enriched 3D wireframe graph
at LoD 4 (Modality I), the corresponding floor plan images (Modality II), and a
LiDAR-like roof point cloud (Modality III). The semantic annotations for each
building wireframe are derived from the corresponding floor plan images and
include information on rooms, doors, and windows. Through its tri-modal nature,
future work can use SYNBUILD-3D to develop novel generative AI algorithms that
automate the creation of 3D building models at LoD 4, subject to predefined
floor plan layouts and roof geometries, while enforcing semantic-geometric
consistency. Dataset and code samples are publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新颖的统一方法，用于同时估计图像间的单应性和径向畸变，适用于三种不同配置，并展示了其快速、稳定且准确的特性。


<details>

Result: 在三种情况下，提出的求解器均比现有最先进的求解器更快，同时保持了相似的准确性。实验在包括鱼眼相机图像的基准测试上进行了验证。

Conclusion: 论文成功提出了一种统一且高效的解决方案，能够同时处理单应性和径向畸变，并在速度和准确性上优于现有方法。

Abstract: Homographies are among the most prevalent transformations occurring in
geometric computer vision and projective geometry, and homography estimation is
consequently a crucial step in a wide assortment of computer vision tasks. When
working with real images, which are often afflicted with geometric distortions
caused by the camera lens, it may be necessary to determine both the homography
and the lens distortion-particularly the radial component, called radial
distortion-simultaneously to obtain anything resembling useful estimates. When
considering a homography with radial distortion between two images, there are
three conceptually distinct configurations for the radial distortion; (i)
distortion in only one image, (ii) identical distortion in the two images, and
(iii) independent distortion in the two images. While these cases have been
addressed separately in the past, the present paper provides a novel and
unified approach to solve all three cases. We demonstrate how the proposed
approach can be used to construct new fast, stable, and accurate minimal
solvers for radially distorted homographies. In all three cases, our proposed
solvers are faster than the existing state-of-the-art solvers while maintaining
similar accuracy. The solvers are tested on well-established benchmarks
including images taken with fisheye cameras. The source code for our solvers
will be made available in the event our paper is accepted for publication.

Result: 实验表明，GCAV显著减少了TCAV分数的方差，增强了概念定位能力，并提高了对抗扰动的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过提出全局概念激活向量（GCAV），论文成功解决了独立计算CAV导致的跨层不一致性问题，为深度学习模型的人类定义概念编码提供了更全面和可解释的理解。

Abstract: Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) provide a powerful approach for
interpreting deep neural networks by quantifying their sensitivity to
human-defined concepts. However, when computed independently at different
layers, CAVs often exhibit inconsistencies, making cross-layer comparisons
unreliable. To address this issue, we propose the Global Concept Activation
Vector (GCAV), a novel framework that unifies CAVs into a single, semantically
consistent representation. Our method leverages contrastive learning to align
concept representations across layers and employs an attention-based fusion
mechanism to construct a globally integrated CAV. By doing so, our method
significantly reduces the variance in TCAV scores while preserving concept
relevance, ensuring more stable and reliable concept attributions. To evaluate
the effectiveness of GCAV, we introduce Testing with Global Concept Activation
Vectors (TGCAV) as a method to apply TCAV to GCAV-based representations. We
conduct extensive experiments on multiple deep neural networks, demonstrating
that our method effectively mitigates concept inconsistency across layers,
enhances concept localization, and improves robustness against adversarial
perturbations. By integrating cross-layer information into a coherent
framework, our method offers a more comprehensive and interpretable
understanding of how deep learning models encode human-defined concepts. Code

*Zhizhong Huang,Xiaoming Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VICP提出了一种新的框架，通过上下文示例作为提示，使模型能够泛化到未见类别，无需参数调整，结合LLM和VFM的优势，显著提升了ReID任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的对象重识别方法缺乏泛化能力，且对新类别需要昂贵的标注数据，自监督学习难以捕捉身份敏感特征。

Method: VICP结合LLM和VFM，利用LLM推断语义规则，并通过动态视觉提示指导VFM提取ID区分特征。

Result: 在ShopID10K和其他ReID基准测试中，VICP在未见类别上显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: VICP通过上下文提示和模型协同，实现了对新类别的直接泛化，避免了数据集特定重新训练的需求。

Abstract: Current object re-identification (ReID) methods train domain-specific models
(e.g., for persons or vehicles), which lack generalization and demand costly
labeled data for new categories. While self-supervised learning reduces
annotation needs by learning instance-wise invariance, it struggles to capture
\textit{identity-sensitive} features critical for ReID. This paper proposes
Visual In-Context Prompting~(VICP), a novel framework where models trained on
seen categories can directly generalize to unseen novel categories using only
\textit{in-context examples} as prompts, without requiring parameter
adaptation. VICP synergizes LLMs and vision foundation models~(VFM): LLMs infer
semantic identity rules from few-shot positive/negative pairs through
task-specific prompting, which then guides a VFM (\eg, DINO) to extract
ID-discriminative features via \textit{dynamic visual prompts}. By aligning
LLM-derived semantic concepts with the VFM's pre-trained prior, VICP enables
generalization to novel categories, eliminating the need for dataset-specific
retraining. To support evaluation, we introduce ShopID10K, a dataset of 10K
object instances from e-commerce platforms, featuring multi-view images and
cross-domain testing. Experiments on ShopID10K and diverse ReID benchmarks
demonstrate that VICP outperforms baselines by a clear margin on unseen
categories. Code is available at https://github.com/Hzzone/VICP.

TL;DR: 研究评估了SegResNet在MRI胰腺肿瘤分割中的表现，结果显示小数据集和不同MRI序列的挑战，但展示了自动化分割的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胰腺肿瘤的准确分割对诊断、治疗计划和结果评估至关重要，但自动分割仍面临解剖学变异性和数据集有限的挑战。

Method: 研究使用SegResNet模型（作为Auto3DSeg架构的一部分），通过5折交叉验证和STAPLE集成方法，在两个MRI任务上训练和评估胰腺肿瘤分割效果。评估指标包括DSC、5 mm DSC、HD95、MASD和RMSE。

Result: 任务1的DSC为0.56，任务2的DSC降至0.33。结果显示不同MRI序列引入的变异性，表明小数据集条件下的分割挑战。

Conclusion: 尽管模型表现一般，但结果展示了胰腺肿瘤自动分割的潜力，并强调了需要更大、标准化的MRI数据集以提高模型的鲁棒性和临床实用性。

Abstract: Accurate delineation of pancreatic tumors is critical for diagnosis,
treatment planning, and outcome assessment, yet automated segmentation remains
challenging due to anatomical variability and limited dataset availability. In
this study, SegResNet models, as part of the Auto3DSeg architecture, were
trained and evaluated on two MRI-based pancreatic tumor segmentation tasks as
part of the 2025 PANTHER Challenge. Algorithm methodology included 5-fold
cross-validation with STAPLE ensembling after focusing on an anatomically
relevant region-of-interest. The Pancreatic Tumor Segmentation on Diagnostic
MRI task 1 training set included 91 T1-weighted arterial contrast-enhanced MRI
with expert annotated pancreas and tumor labels. The Pancreatic Tumor
Segmentation on MR-Linac task 2 training set used 50 T2-weighted MR-Linac cases
with expert annotated pancreas and tumor labels. Algorithm-automated
segmentation performance of pancreatic tumor was assessed using Dice Similarity
Coefficient (DSC), 5 mm DSC, 95th percentile Hausdorff Distance (HD95), Mean
Average Surface Distance (MASD), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). For Task 1,
the algorithm achieved a DSC of 0.56, 5 mm DSC of 0.73, HD95 of 41.1 mm, MASD
of 26.0 mm, and RMSE of 5164 mm. For Task 2, performance decreased, with a DSC
of 0.33, 5 mm DSC of 0.50, HD95 of 20.1 mm, MASD of 7.2 mm, and RMSE of 17,203
mm. These findings illustrate the challenges of MRI-based pancreatic tumor
segmentation with small datasets, highlighting variability introduced by
different MRI sequences. Despite modest performance, the results demonstrate
potential for automated delineation and emphasize the need for larger,
standardized MRI datasets to improve model robustness and clinical utility.

Conclusion: 通过逆向成像方法，本研究解决了心脏MRI分割模型中图像对比度变化导致的泛化问题，实现了跨序列的高精度分割。

Abstract: Pretrained segmentation models for cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
struggle to generalize across different imaging sequences due to significant
variations in image contrast. These variations arise from changes in imaging
protocols, yet the same fundamental spin properties, including proton density,
T1, and T2 values, govern all acquired images. With this core principle, we
introduce Reverse Imaging, a novel physics-driven method for cardiac MRI data
augmentation and domain adaptation to fundamentally solve the generalization
problem. Our method reversely infers the underlying spin properties from
observed cardiac MRI images, by solving ill-posed nonlinear inverse problems
regularized by the prior distribution of spin properties. We acquire this "spin
prior" by learning a generative diffusion model from the multiparametric
SAturation-recovery single-SHot acquisition sequence (mSASHA) dataset, which
offers joint cardiac T1 and T2 maps. Our method enables approximate but
meaningful spin-property estimates from MR images, which provide an
interpretable "latent variable" that lead to highly flexible image synthesis of
arbitrary novel sequences. We show that Reverse Imaging enables highly accurate
segmentation across vastly different image contrasts and imaging protocols,
realizing wide-spectrum generalization of cardiac MRI segmentation.

TL;DR: PHD是一种个性化3D人体网格恢复方法，通过形状条件化的3D姿势先验和点扩散变压器，显著提升了姿势估计的准确性，尤其在绝对姿势准确性方面表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统HMR方法忽略了用户特定形状与3D姿势合理性之间的联合优化，导致3D准确性不足。PHD通过解耦形状校准和姿势拟合，解决了这一问题。

Method: 提出了一个分步流程，首先校准用户特定形状，然后基于该形状进行个性化姿势拟合。使用点扩散变压器实现了形状条件化的3D姿势先验，并通过点蒸馏采样损失迭代指导姿势拟合。

Result: PHD不仅提高了骨盆对齐姿势准确性，还显著改善了绝对姿势准确性。此外，该方法数据高效，仅需合成数据进行训练。

Conclusion: PHD方法通过引入个性化形状信息和3D姿势先验，显著提高了3D人体网格恢复和姿势估计的准确性，尤其在绝对姿势准确性方面表现突出。该方法具有高效的数据利用率和模块化设计，可与现有3D姿势估计器无缝集成。

Abstract: We introduce PHD, a novel approach for personalized 3D human mesh recovery
(HMR) and body fitting that leverages user-specific shape information to
improve pose estimation accuracy from videos. Traditional HMR methods are
designed to be user-agnostic and optimized for generalization. While these
methods often refine poses using constraints derived from the 2D image to
improve alignment, this process compromises 3D accuracy by failing to jointly
account for person-specific body shapes and the plausibility of 3D poses. In
contrast, our pipeline decouples this process by first calibrating the user's
body shape and then employing a personalized pose fitting process conditioned
on that shape. To achieve this, we develop a body shape-conditioned 3D pose
prior, implemented as a Point Diffusion Transformer, which iteratively guides
the pose fitting via a Point Distillation Sampling loss. This learned 3D pose
prior effectively mitigates errors arising from an over-reliance on 2D
constraints. Consequently, our approach improves not only pelvis-aligned pose
accuracy but also absolute pose accuracy -- an important metric often
overlooked by prior work. Furthermore, our method is highly data-efficient,
requiring only synthetic data for training, and serves as a versatile
plug-and-play module that can be seamlessly integrated with existing 3D pose
estimators to enhance their performance. Project page:

Motivation: 扩散模型在生成高保真3D人体姿态时计算成本高，需高效剪枝策略以优化性能。

Method: 1. Temporal Correlation-Enhanced Pruning (TCEP)分析帧间运动相关性以剪枝冗余帧；2. Sparse-Focused Temporal MHSA (SFT MHSA)利用帧级稀疏性减少注意力计算；3. Mask-Guided Pose Token Pruner (MGPTP)通过聚类进行细粒度语义剪枝。

Conclusion: HTP框架通过分层时间剪枝策略显著提升了3D人体姿态估计的效率，同时保持了先进的性能。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated strong capabilities in generating
high-fidelity 3D human poses, yet their iterative nature and multi-hypothesis
requirements incur substantial computational cost. In this paper, we propose an
Efficient Diffusion-Based 3D Human Pose Estimation framework with a
Hierarchical Temporal Pruning (HTP) strategy, which dynamically prunes
redundant pose tokens across both frame and semantic levels while preserving
critical motion dynamics. HTP operates in a staged, top-down manner: (1)
Temporal Correlation-Enhanced Pruning (TCEP) identifies essential frames by
analyzing inter-frame motion correlations through adaptive temporal graph
construction; (2) Sparse-Focused Temporal MHSA (SFT MHSA) leverages the
resulting frame-level sparsity to reduce attention computation, focusing on
motion-relevant tokens; and (3) Mask-Guided Pose Token Pruner (MGPTP) performs
fine-grained semantic pruning via clustering, retaining only the most
informative pose tokens. Experiments on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP show that
HTP reduces training MACs by 38.5\%, inference MACs by 56.8\%, and improves
inference speed by an average of 81.1\% compared to prior diffusion-based
methods, while achieving state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OCT指纹数据获取成本高且耗时，导致大规模公开数据集稀缺，阻碍了深度学习算法的发展。

Method: Print2Volume框架分为三个阶段：2D风格转换模块、3D结构扩展网络和OCT真实性细化模块（基于3D GAN）。

Result: 使用Print2Volume生成的合成数据集（420,000个样本）显著提升了指纹识别性能，将EER从15.62%降至2.50%。

Conclusion: Print2Volume框架通过生成高质量的合成OCT指纹数据，显著提升了指纹识别的性能，验证了其在解决数据稀缺问题上的有效性。

Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) enables the acquisition of
high-resolution, three-dimensional fingerprint data, capturing rich subsurface
structures for robust biometric recognition. However, the high cost and
time-consuming nature of OCT data acquisition have led to a scarcity of
large-scale public datasets, significantly hindering the development of
advanced algorithms, particularly data-hungry deep learning models. To address
this critical bottleneck, this paper introduces Print2Volume, a novel framework
for generating realistic, synthetic OCT-based 3D fingerprints from 2D
fingerprint image. Our framework operates in three sequential stages: (1) a 2D
style transfer module that converts a binary fingerprint into a grayscale
images mimicking the style of a Z-direction mean-projected OCT scan; (2) a 3D
Structure Expansion Network that extrapolates the 2D im-age into a plausible 3D
anatomical volume; and (3) an OCT Realism Refiner, based on a 3D GAN, that
renders the structural volume with authentic textures, speckle noise, and other
imaging characteristics. Using Print2Volume, we generated a large-scale
synthetic dataset of 420,000 samples. Quantitative experiments demonstrate the
high quality of our synthetic data and its significant impact on recognition
performance. By pre-training a recognition model on our synthetic data and
fine-tuning it on a small real-world dataset, we achieved a remarkable
reduction in the Equal Error Rate (EER) from 15.62% to 2.50% on the ZJUT-EIFD
benchmark, proving the effectiveness of our approach in overcoming data
scarcity.

Conclusion: GLENDA数据集填补了妇科腹腔镜手术中关于子宫内膜异位症的数据空白，为未来计算机视觉和机器学习研究提供了宝贵的资源。

Abstract: Gynecologic laparoscopy as a type of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is
performed via a live feed of a patient's abdomen surveying the insertion and
handling of various instruments for conducting treatment. Adopting this kind of
surgical intervention not only facilitates a great variety of treatments, the
possibility of recording said video streams is as well essential for numerous
post-surgical activities, such as treatment planning, case documentation and
education. Nonetheless, the process of manually analyzing surgical recordings,
as it is carried out in current practice, usually proves tediously
time-consuming. In order to improve upon this situation, more sophisticated
computer vision as well as machine learning approaches are actively developed.
Since most of such approaches heavily rely on sample data, which especially in
the medical field is only sparsely available, with this work we publish the
Gynecologic Laparoscopy ENdometriosis DAtaset (GLENDA) - an image dataset
containing region-based annotations of a common medical condition named
endometriosis, i.e. the dislocation of uterine-like tissue. The dataset is the
first of its kind and it has been created in collaboration with leading medical
experts in the field.

Conclusion: 手术器械的分割在视频中取得了较高的准确率，但由于手术器械之间的相似性，识别具体器械仍存在较大挑战。

Abstract: Recorded videos from surgeries have become an increasingly important
information source for the field of medical endoscopy, since the recorded
footage shows every single detail of the surgery. However, while video
recording is straightforward these days, automatic content indexing - the basis
for content-based search in a medical video archive - is still a great
challenge due to the very special video content. In this work, we investigate
segmentation and recognition of surgical instruments in videos recorded from
laparoscopic gynecology. More precisely, we evaluate the achievable performance
of segmenting surgical instruments from their background by using a
region-based fully convolutional network for instance-aware (1) instrument
segmentation as well as (2) instrument recognition. While the first part
addresses only binary segmentation of instances (i.e., distinguishing between
instrument or background) we also investigate multi-class instrument
recognition (i.e., identifying the type of instrument). Our evaluation results
show that even with a moderately low number of training examples, we are able
to localize and segment instrument regions with a pretty high accuracy.
However, the results also reveal that determining the particular instrument is
still very challenging, due to the inherently high similarity of surgical
instruments.

Motivation: 目前缺乏关于Whole Slide Image (WSI)内容的标准化元数据，导致AI算法训练或验证时的样本选择依赖人工检查，不适用于大规模数据集。

Method: 研究提出了一个三层组织结构的组织图谱，分别包括来源、组织类型和病理变化，并为WSI的每个部分分配特定类别。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种通用的框架，用于生成WSI的2D索引图和特定应用领域的分析机制，并通过临床病理学领域的示例展示了其优势。

Abstract: A Whole Slide Image (WSI) is a high-resolution digital image created by
scanning an entire glass slide containing a biological specimen, such as tissue
sections or cell samples, at multiple magnifications. These images can be
viewed, analyzed, shared digitally, and are used today for Artificial
Intelligence (AI) algorithm development. WSIs are used in a variety of fields,
including pathology for diagnosing diseases and oncology for cancer research.
They are also utilized in neurology, veterinary medicine, hematology,
microbiology, dermatology, pharmacology, toxicology, immunology, and forensic
science.
  When assembling cohorts for the training or validation of an AI algorithm, it
is essential to know what is present on such a WSI. However, there is currently
no standard for this metadata, so such selection has mainly been done through
manual inspection, which is not suitable for large collections with several
million objects.
  We propose a general framework to generate a 2D index map for WSI and a
profiling mechanism for specific application domains. We demonstrate this
approach in the field of clinical pathology, using common syntax and semantics
to achieve interoperability between different catalogs.
  Our approach augments each WSI collection with a detailed tissue map that
provides fine-grained information about the WSI content. The tissue map is
organized into three layers: source, tissue type, and pathological alterations,
with each layer assigning segments of the WSI to specific classes.
  We illustrate the advantages and applicability of the proposed standard
through specific examples in WSI catalogs, Machine Learning (ML), and
graph-based WSI representations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中，训练时未见的新类别不断出现，现有方法假设增量数据集完全标注，这不切实际，因此提出无监督增量学习解决方案。

Method: 通过基于置信度的伪标签替代人工标注，将伪标签集成到多种CIL方法中，并评估了性能下降。

Result: 与监督方法相比，ICPL取得竞争性结果，且在最终准确率上比state-of-the-art的class-iNCD方法高出5%以上。

Conclusion: ICPL方法在无监督增量学习任务中表现优异，其性能接近监督学习方法，且在资源受限的环境中显示出实际应用的潜力。

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many
computer vision tasks. However, in real-world scenarios, novel classes that
were unseen during training often emerge, requiring models to acquire new
knowledge incrementally. Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) methods enable a
model to learn novel classes while retaining knowledge of previous classes.
However, these methods make the strong assumption that the incremental dataset
is fully labeled, which is unrealistic in practice. In this work, we propose an
unsupervised Incremental Learning method using Confidence-based Pseudo-labels
(ICPL), which replaces human annotations with pseudo-labels, enabling
incremental learning from unlabeled datasets. We integrate these pseudo-labels
into various CIL methods with confidence-based selection and evaluate
performance degradation on CIFAR100 and ImageNet100. Then, we compare our
approach to popular Class Incremental Novel Category Discovery (class-iNCD)
methods addressing similar challenges. Additionally, we apply our method to
fine-grained datasets to demonstrate its real-world practicality and measure
its computational complexity to validate its suitability for
resource-constrained environments. ICPL achieves competitive results compared
to supervised methods and outperforms state-of-the-art class-iNCD methods by
more than 5% in final accuracy.

Method: 提出MedShift模型，基于Flow Matching和Schrodinger Bridges，学习域无关的共享潜在空间，支持无配对数据的跨域图像翻译。

Result: 实验结果表明，MedShift在模型规模较小的情况下仍能提供强性能，并能在推理时灵活调整以优先考虑感知保真度或结构一致性。

Conclusion: MedShift提出了一种基于Flow Matching和Schrodinger Bridges的统一生成模型，能够高效且灵活地在合成与真实X射线图像之间进行域适应，表现出良好的性能和可扩展性。

Abstract: Synthetic medical data offers a scalable solution for training robust models,
but significant domain gaps limit its generalizability to real-world clinical
settings. This paper addresses the challenge of cross-domain translation
between synthetic and real X-ray images of the head, focusing on bridging
discrepancies in attenuation behavior, noise characteristics, and soft tissue
representation. We propose MedShift, a unified class-conditional generative
model based on Flow Matching and Schrodinger Bridges, which enables
high-fidelity, unpaired image translation across multiple domains. Unlike prior
approaches that require domain-specific training or rely on paired data,
MedShift learns a shared domain-agnostic latent space and supports seamless
translation between any pair of domains seen during training. We introduce
X-DigiSkull, a new dataset comprising aligned synthetic and real skull X-rays
under varying radiation doses, to benchmark domain translation models.
Experimental results demonstrate that, despite its smaller model size compared
to diffusion-based approaches, MedShift offers strong performance and remains
flexible at inference time, as it can be tuned to prioritize either perceptual
fidelity or structural consistency, making it a scalable and generalizable
solution for domain adaptation in medical imaging. The code and dataset are

large-scale monitoring of individual trees remains limited by inadequate
modelling. Available global products have focused on binary tree cover or
canopy height, which do not explicitely identify trees at individual level. In
this study, we present a deep learning approach for detecting large individual
trees in 3-m resolution PlanetScope imagery at a global scale. We simulate tree
crowns with Gaussian kernels of scalable size, allowing the extraction of crown
centers and the generation of binary tree cover maps. Training is based on
billions of points automatically extracted from airborne lidar data, enabling
the model to successfully identify trees both inside and outside forests. We
compare against existing tree cover maps and airborne lidar with
state-of-the-art performance (fractional cover R$^2 = 0.81$ against aerial
lidar), report balanced detection metrics across biomes, and demonstrate how
detection can be further improved through fine-tuning with manual labels. Our
method offers a scalable framework for global, high-resolution tree monitoring,
and is adaptable to future satellite missions offering improved imagery.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables high-fidelity real-time rendering, a key
requirement for immersive applications. However, the extension of 3DGS to
dynamic scenes remains limitations on the substantial data volume of dense
Gaussians and the prolonged training time required for each frame. This paper
presents \M, a scalable Gaussian Splatting framework designed for efficient
training in streaming tasks. Specifically, Gaussian spheres are hierarchically
organized by scale within an anchor-based structure. Coarser-level Gaussians
represent the low-resolution structure of the scene, while finer-level
Gaussians, responsible for detailed high-fidelity rendering, are selectively
activated by the coarser-level Gaussians. To further reduce computational
overhead, we introduce a hybrid deformation and spawning strategy that models
motion of inter-frame through Gaussian deformation and triggers Gaussian
spawning to characterize wide-range motion. Additionally, a bidirectional
adaptive masking mechanism enhances training efficiency by removing static
regions and prioritizing informative viewpoints. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that \M~ achieves superior visual quality while significantly
reducing training time compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Image captioning is fundamental for applications like video instruction
systems and exploration robots, yet deploying such models on local devices is
challenging due to the high computational demands of multimodal large language
models (MLLMs). To address this, we first explore lightweight captioning by
implementing a specialist based on a 125M-parameter language model, 56 times
smaller than LLaMA-7B, and evaluating its performance on both single-sentence
and detailed captioning tasks. Surprisingly, we find that our model can achieve
performance comparable to large multimodal generalists, suggesting its
potential to serve as a strong visual specialist for on-device applications.
While promising, our model also exhibits a limitation: like other MLLMs, it
suffers from visual blindness, occasionally resulting in semantic captioning
errors. We carry out toy experiments and investigate the underlying causes,
where we observe that the problems arise from ineffective attention mechanisms
and limited visual representations. To alleviate them, we develop a novel
captioning framework, Sharp-Eyed Refinement, which enhances caption quality
through improved visual grounding. At its core, our DeepLens extracts detailed
visual representations by concentrating on informative regions identified
during the initial glance. Our experiments confirm both the advantages of our
specialist over prior small captioning models and large generalists and the
effectiveness of our framework.

Abstract: While foundation models (FMs) offer strong potential for AI-based dementia

underexplored. In this benchmarking study, we systematically evaluate the
impact of key design choices: classification head architecture, fine-tuning
strategy, and aggregation method, on the performance and efficiency of
federated FM tuning using brain MRI data. Using a large multi-cohort dataset,
we find that the architecture of the classification head substantially
influences performance, freezing the FM encoder achieves comparable results to
full fine-tuning, and advanced aggregation methods outperform standard
federated averaging. Our results offer practical insights for deploying FMs in
decentralized clinical settings and highlight trade-offs that should guide

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的OOD检测方法通常只关注单一技术或特定类型的OOD数据集，忽略了结合多种技术的潜力。

Method: 结合了最先进的特征截断和评分函数，提出了Multi-Method Ensemble (MME)评分方法。

Result: 实验表明，MME在所有基准测试中均优于现有方法，尤其在ImageNet-1K上FPR95降低了6%。

Conclusion: MME通过集成多种技术显著提高了OOD检测的鲁棒性和效果。

Abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is essential for neural networks
operating in open-world settings, particularly in safety-critical applications.
Existing methods have improved OOD detection by leveraging two main techniques:
feature truncation, which increases the separation between in-distribution (ID)
and OOD samples, and scoring functions, which assign scores to distinguish
between ID and OOD data. However, most approaches either focus on a single
family of techniques or evaluate their effectiveness on a specific type of OOD
dataset, overlooking the potential of combining multiple existing solutions.
Motivated by this observation, we theoretically and empirically demonstrate
that state-of-the-art feature truncation and scoring functions can be
effectively combined. Moreover, we show that aggregating multiple scoring
functions enhances robustness against various types of OOD samples. Based on
these insights, we propose the Multi-Method Ensemble (MME) score, which unifies
state-of-the-art OOD detectors into a single, more effective scoring function.
Extensive experiments on both large-scale and small-scale benchmarks, covering
near-OOD and far-OOD scenarios, show that MME significantly outperforms recent
state-of-the-art methods across all benchmarks. Notably, using the BiT model,
our method achieves an average FPR95 of 27.57% on the challenging ImageNet-1K
benchmark, improving performance by 6% over the best existing baseline.

Result: 在HRSC2016数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著提高了对抗性补丁攻击的成功率和迁移性。

Conclusion: 局部增强方法有效减少了背景干扰，提高了对抗性攻击的效果和迁移性。

Abstract: Current ship detection techniques based on remote sensing imagery primarily
rely on the object detection capabilities of deep neural networks (DNNs).
However, DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial patch attacks, which can lead to
misclassification by the detection model or complete evasion of the targets.
Numerous studies have demonstrated that data transformation-based methods can
improve the transferability of adversarial examples. However, excessive
augmentation of image backgrounds or irrelevant regions may introduce
unnecessary interference, resulting in false detections of the object detection
model. These errors are not caused by the adversarial patches themselves but
rather by the over-augmentation of background and non-target areas. This paper
proposes a localized augmentation method that applies augmentation only to the
target regions, avoiding any influence on non-target areas. By reducing
background interference, this approach enables the loss function to focus more
directly on the impact of the adversarial patch on the detection model, thereby
improving the attack success rate. Experiments conducted on the HRSC2016
dataset demonstrate that the proposed method effectively increases the success
rate of adversarial patch attacks and enhances their transferability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出ELV-Halluc基准研究长视频中的语义聚合幻觉（SAH），发现SAH与语义复杂性相关，并通过改进位置编码和DPO策略显著降低了SAH比例。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频多模态大语言模型（Video-MLLMs）在视频理解方面取得了显著进展，但仍存在幻觉问题，即生成与视频输入不一致或无关的内容。此前的研究主要针对短视频，且将幻觉归因于语言先验强、帧缺失或视觉编码器引入的视觉语言偏差。然而，这类研究仍过于简化了幻觉的成因。论文发现，长视频中语义复杂性增加会引发语义聚合幻觉（SAH），需对其单独研究。

Method: 论文提出了首个专注于长视频幻觉的基准ELV-Halluc，并通过实验验证了SAH的存在。研究分析了SAH的成因及其受语义复杂性和变化速度的影响。论文提出了改进位置编码策略和采用DPO策略的方法，以增强模型在事件内和事件间语义区分的能力，并通过8K对抗数据对验证了方法的有效性。

Result: 论文提出的ELV-Halluc基准首次系统地研究了长视频中的SAH现象。实验表明，SAH的存在与语义复杂性及变化速度密切相关。通过改进位置编码策略和采用DPO策略，模型在SAH比例上实现了27.7%的降低，并在ELV-Halluc和Video-MME基准上取得了显著改进。

Conclusion: 论文通过引入ELV-Halluc基准系统性地研究了长视频中的语义聚合幻觉（SAH），并验证了其存在性。实验表明，SAH随着语义复杂性增加而加剧，且在语义快速变化时更易发生。通过改进位置编码策略和采用DPO策略，论文有效降低了SAH比例（27.7%），并在ELV-Halluc和Video-MME基准上取得了显著改进。

Abstract: Video multimodal large language models (Video-MLLMs) have achieved remarkable
progress in video understanding. However, they remain vulnerable to
hallucination-producing content inconsistent with or unrelated to video inputs.
Previous video hallucination benchmarks primarily focus on short-videos. They
attribute hallucinations to factors such as strong language priors, missing
frames, or vision-language biases introduced by the visual encoder. While these
causes indeed account for most hallucinations in short videos, they still
oversimplify the cause of hallucinations. Sometimes, models generate incorrect
outputs but with correct frame-level semantics. We refer to this type of
hallucination as Semantic Aggregation Hallucination (SAH), which arises during
the process of aggregating frame-level semantics into event-level semantic
groups. Given that SAH becomes particularly critical in long videos due to
increased semantic complexity across multiple events, it is essential to
separate and thoroughly investigate the causes of this type of hallucination.
To address the above issues, we introduce ELV-Halluc, the first benchmark
dedicated to long-video hallucination, enabling a systematic investigation of
SAH. Our experiments confirm the existence of SAH and show that it increases
with semantic complexity. Additionally, we find that models are more prone to
SAH on rapidly changing semantics. Moreover, we discuss potential approaches to
mitigate SAH. We demonstrate that positional encoding strategy contributes to
alleviating SAH, and further adopt DPO strategy to enhance the model's ability
to distinguish semantics within and across events. To support this, we curate a
dataset of 8K adversarial data pairs and achieve improvements on both
ELV-Halluc and Video-MME, including a substantial 27.7% reduction in SAH ratio.

Conclusion: 该研究表明，通过卷积神经网络上采样低分辨率特征并结合输入图像，可以显著提高显微镜等大尺寸图像的细粒度特征表示能力，且无需额外训练即可高效应用于多种图像分割任务。

Abstract: Feature foundation models - usually vision transformers - offer rich semantic
descriptors of images, useful for downstream tasks such as (interactive)
segmentation and object detection. For computational efficiency these
descriptors are often patch-based, and so struggle to represent the fine
features often present in micrographs; they also struggle with the large image
sizes present in materials and biological image analysis. In this work, we
train a convolutional neural network to upsample low-resolution (i.e, large
patch size) foundation model features with reference to the input image. We
apply this upsampler network (without any further training) to efficiently
featurise and then segment a variety of microscopy images, including plant
cells, a lithium-ion battery cathode and organic crystals. The richness of
these upsampled features admits separation of hard to segment phases, like
hairline cracks. We demonstrate that interactive segmentation with these deep
features produces high-quality segmentations far faster and with far fewer
labels than training or finetuning a more traditional convolutional network.

*Hao Ruan,Jinliang Lin,Yingxin Lai,Zhiming Luo,Shaozi Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HCCM framework improves vision-language understanding in drone scenarios by combining hierarchical contrastive and matching learning, achieving state-of-the-art performance in retrieval tasks and strong zero-shot generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenges of wide field of view, complex compositional semantics, and incomplete or ambiguous text descriptions in drone scenarios motivate the development of HCCM. Existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) lack fine-grained semantics and hierarchical methods are limited by rigid constraints, necessitating a more robust approach.

Method: The paper proposes a Hierarchical Cross-Granularity Contrastive and Matching learning (HCCM) framework with two components: Region-Global Image-Text Contrastive Learning (RG-ITC) for capturing hierarchical semantics without precise scene partitioning, and Region-Global Image-Text Matching (RG-ITM) for local semantic consistency evaluation. Additionally, a Momentum Contrast and Distillation (MCD) mechanism is introduced to address incomplete or ambiguous text descriptions.

Result: HCCM achieves state-of-the-art Recall@1 scores of 28.8% for image retrieval and 14.7% for text retrieval on GeoText-1652. It also shows strong zero-shot generalization with 39.93% mean recall on the unseen ERA dataset, outperforming fine-tuned baselines.

Conclusion: The HCCM framework demonstrates superior performance in drone-related vision-language tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results in image and text retrieval tasks, and showing strong zero-shot generalization capability.

Abstract: Natural Language-Guided Drones (NLGD) provide a novel paradigm for tasks such
as target matching and navigation. However, the wide field of view and complex
compositional semantics in drone scenarios pose challenges for vision-language
understanding. Mainstream Vision-Language Models (VLMs) emphasize global
alignment while lacking fine-grained semantics, and existing hierarchical
methods depend on precise entity partitioning and strict containment, limiting
effectiveness in dynamic environments. To address this, we propose the
Hierarchical Cross-Granularity Contrastive and Matching learning (HCCM)
framework with two components: (1) Region-Global Image-Text Contrastive
Learning (RG-ITC), which avoids precise scene partitioning and captures
hierarchical local-to-global semantics by contrasting local visual regions with
global text and vice versa; (2) Region-Global Image-Text Matching (RG-ITM),
which dispenses with rigid constraints and instead evaluates local semantic
consistency within global cross-modal representations, enhancing compositional
reasoning. Moreover, drone text descriptions are often incomplete or ambiguous,
destabilizing alignment. HCCM introduces a Momentum Contrast and Distillation
(MCD) mechanism to improve robustness. Experiments on GeoText-1652 show HCCM
achieves state-of-the-art Recall@1 of 28.8% (image retrieval) and 14.7% (text
retrieval). On the unseen ERA dataset, HCCM demonstrates strong zero-shot
generalization with 39.93% mean recall (mR), outperforming fine-tuned
baselines.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种基于潜在扩散模型的生成方法，能够从单张图像中重建完整的3D场景（包括遮挡部分），并通过变分自编码器在缺乏真实训练数据的情况下实现自监督学习。

Abstract: Gaussian splatting typically requires dense observations of the scene and can
fail to reconstruct occluded and unobserved areas. We propose a latent
diffusion model to reconstruct a complete 3D scene with Gaussian splats,
including the occluded parts, from only a single image during inference.
Completing the unobserved surfaces of a scene is challenging due to the
ambiguity of the plausible surfaces. Conventional methods use a
regression-based formulation to predict a single "mode" for occluded and
out-of-frustum surfaces, leading to blurriness, implausibility, and failure to
capture multiple possible explanations. Thus, they often address this problem
partially, focusing either on objects isolated from the background,
reconstructing only visible surfaces, or failing to extrapolate far from the
input views. In contrast, we propose a generative formulation to learn a
distribution of 3D representations of Gaussian splats conditioned on a single
input image. To address the lack of ground-truth training data, we propose a
Variational AutoReconstructor to learn a latent space only from 2D images in a
self-supervised manner, over which a diffusion model is trained. Our method
generates faithful reconstructions and diverse samples with the ability to
complete the occluded surfaces for high-quality 360-degree renderings.

Motivation: 成对比较虽然可靠，但需要大量标注，现有方法虽减少了标注量，但仍有提升空间。

Method: EZ-Sort使用CLIP模型进行零样本预排序，初始化桶感知Elo分数，并运行不确定性指导的人机合并排序。

Result: EZ-Sort在多个数据集上减少了90.5%的标注成本，比先前工作减少19.8%，同时保持或提升了评测者间可靠性。

Conclusion: 结合CLIP的先验知识和不确定性感知采样，EZ-Sort为成对排名提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Pairwise comparison is often favored over absolute rating or ordinal
classification in subjective or difficult annotation tasks due to its improved
reliability. However, exhaustive comparisons require a massive number of
annotations (O(n^2)). Recent work has greatly reduced the annotation burden
(O(n log n)) by actively sampling pairwise comparisons using a sorting
algorithm. We further improve annotation efficiency by (1) roughly pre-ordering
items using the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model
hierarchically without training, and (2) replacing easy, obvious human
comparisons with automated comparisons. The proposed EZ-Sort first produces a
CLIP-based zero-shot pre-ordering, then initializes bucket-aware Elo scores,
and finally runs an uncertainty-guided human-in-the-loop MergeSort. Validation
was conducted using various datasets: face-age estimation (FGNET), historical
image chronology (DHCI), and retinal image quality assessment (EyePACS). It
showed that EZ-Sort reduced human annotation cost by 90.5% compared to
exhaustive pairwise comparisons and by 19.8% compared to prior work (when n =
100), while improving or maintaining inter-rater reliability. These results
demonstrate that combining CLIP-based priors with uncertainty-aware sampling
yields an efficient and scalable solution for pairwise ranking.

Motivation: 通过可穿戴设备（如智能眼镜和手表）的普及，从自中心视角建模人类-物体交互（HOI）成为一个重要但尚未充分探索的问题。研究旨在探究仅通过头部和手腕跟踪能恢复多少交互信息。

Method: ECHO 采用了一种基于 Diffusion Transformer 的架构和独特的三变量扩散过程，联合建模人体运动、物体轨迹和接触序列，支持灵活的输入配置。方法在头部中心的规范空间中操作，增强了全局方向的鲁棒性。此外，还提出了基于输送带的推理方法，逐步增加扩散时间戳，支持处理任意长度的序列。

Conclusion: ECHO 提出了一个统一的框架，首次通过最小化观测（仅头部和手腕跟踪）恢复了三种模态：人体姿态、物体运动和接触信息，并在性能上超越了现有方法，成为自中心视角下人类-物体交互重建的新标杆。

Abstract: Modeling human-object interactions (HOI) from an egocentric perspective is a
largely unexplored yet important problem due to the increasing adoption of
wearable devices, such as smart glasses and watches. We investigate how much
information about interaction can be recovered from only head and wrists
tracking. Our answer is ECHO (Ego-Centric modeling of Human-Object
interactions), which, for the first time, proposes a unified framework to
recover three modalities: human pose, object motion, and contact from such
minimal observation. ECHO employs a Diffusion Transformer architecture and a
unique three-variate diffusion process, which jointly models human motion,
object trajectory, and contact sequence, allowing for flexible input
configurations. Our method operates in a head-centric canonical space,
enhancing robustness to global orientation. We propose a conveyor-based
inference, which progressively increases the diffusion timestamp with the frame
position, allowing us to process sequences of any length. Through extensive
evaluation, we demonstrate that ECHO outperforms existing methods that do not
offer the same flexibility, setting a state-of-the-art in egocentric HOI
reconstruction.

Abstract: Effectively understanding urban scenes requires fine-grained spatial
reasoning about objects, layouts, and depth cues. However, how well current
vision-language models (VLMs), pretrained on general scenes, transfer these
abilities to urban domain remains underexplored. To address this gap, we
conduct a comparative study of three off-the-shelf VLMs-BLIP-2, InstructBLIP,
and LLaVA-1.5-evaluating both zero-shot performance and the effects of
fine-tuning with a synthetic VQA dataset specific to urban scenes. We construct
such dataset from segmentation, depth, and object detection predictions of
street-view images, pairing each question with LLM-generated Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) answers for step-by-step reasoning supervision. Results show that while
VLMs perform reasonably well in zero-shot settings, fine-tuning with our
synthetic CoT-supervised dataset substantially boosts performance, especially
for challenging question types such as negation and counterfactuals. This study
introduces urban spatial reasoning as a new challenge for VLMs and demonstrates
synthetic dataset construction as a practical path for adapting general-purpose
models to specialized domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在医学图像时序分析中存在局限性，如仅关注单一时间点或特定任务，无法进行精细空间预测。

Method: 提出Temporal Flow Matching (TFM)，一种生成轨迹方法，支持3D体积、多先验扫描和不规则采样。

Result: 在三个公共纵向数据集上的实验表明，TFM性能优于自然图像领域的时空方法。

Conclusion: TFM作为一种统一的生成轨迹方法，在4D医学图像预测领域表现出色，超越现有时空方法，成为新的基准。

Abstract: Understanding temporal dynamics in medical imaging is crucial for
applications such as disease progression modeling, treatment planning and
anatomical development tracking. However, most deep learning methods either
consider only single temporal contexts, or focus on tasks like classification
or regression, limiting their ability for fine-grained spatial predictions.
While some approaches have been explored, they are often limited to single
timepoints, specific diseases or have other technical restrictions. To address
this fundamental gap, we introduce Temporal Flow Matching (TFM), a unified
generative trajectory method that (i) aims to learn the underlying temporal
distribution, (ii) by design can fall back to a nearest image predictor, i.e.
predicting the last context image (LCI), as a special case, and (iii) supports
$3D$ volumes, multiple prior scans, and irregular sampling. Extensive
benchmarks on three public longitudinal datasets show that TFM consistently
surpasses spatio-temporal methods from natural imaging, establishing a new

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究通过整合术前CT和术后病理全切片图像（WSI），评估了多模态深度学习模型在透明细胞肾癌（ccRCC）复发预测中的表现，表明病理数据的预后价值优于仅使用CT数据，且中间融合策略能进一步提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前广泛使用的Leibovich评分在ccRCC远处复发风险分层中存在患者级分辨率低且未整合影像信息的局限性，因此需要探索多模态模型的预测能力。

Method: 采用模块化深度学习框架，结合预训练编码器和基于Cox的生存模型，测试了单模态、晚期融合和中间融合三种策略。

Result: WSI模型优于CT模型，中间融合策略（如TITAN-CONCH与ResNet-18结合）表现最佳，接近Leibovich评分。随机断带分析显示模型的个体化性能可能被高估。

Conclusion: 研究表明基于基础模型的多模态整合在ccRCC个性化风险预测中具有可行性，未来需探索更高效的融合策略和大规模多模态数据集。

Abstract: Recurrence risk estimation in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is
essential for guiding postoperative surveillance and treatment. The Leibovich
score remains widely used for stratifying distant recurrence risk but offers
limited patient-level resolution and excludes imaging information. This study
evaluates multimodal recurrence prediction by integrating preoperative computed
tomography (CT) and postoperative histopathology whole-slide images (WSIs). A
modular deep learning framework with pretrained encoders and Cox-based survival
modeling was tested across unimodal, late fusion, and intermediate fusion
setups. In a real-world ccRCC cohort, WSI-based models consistently
outperformed CT-only models, underscoring the prognostic strength of pathology.
Intermediate fusion further improved performance, with the best model
(TITAN-CONCH with ResNet-18) approaching the adjusted Leibovich score. Random
tie-breaking narrowed the gap between the clinical baseline and learned models,
suggesting discretization may overstate individualized performance. Using
simple embedding concatenation, radiology added value primarily through fusion.
These findings demonstrate the feasibility of foundation model-based multimodal
integration for personalized ccRCC risk prediction. Future work should explore
more expressive fusion strategies, larger multimodal datasets, and
general-purpose CT encoders to better match pathology modeling capacity.

TL;DR: 从传统OCR的字符级别发展到单词级别，再到论文提出的行级别OCR，准确性提升且效率更高，同时贡献了一个新的数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统OCR技术依赖字符分割，容易出错且无法充分利用语言模型。现代技术转向单词级别OCR，但单词分割成为新的瓶颈。因此，提出行级别OCR以绕过单词分割错误并提供更大的上下文。

Method: 提出从单词级别OCR升级为行级别OCR的方案，通过直接处理行文本避免单词分割错误，并利用更大的上下文优化语言模型。

Result: 实验显示行级别OCR在端到端准确性上提升了5.4%，效率提高了4倍。

Conclusion: 论文证明了行级别OCR的潜力，尤其是在文档图像处理中，并为未来语言模型的进步提供了扩展空间。

Abstract: Conventional optical character recognition (OCR) techniques segmented each
character and then recognized. This made them prone to error in character
segmentation, and devoid of context to exploit language models. Advances in
sequence to sequence translation in last decade led to modern techniques first
detecting words and then inputting one word at a time to a model to directly
output full words as sequence of characters. This allowed better utilization of
language models and bypass error-prone character segmentation step. We observe
that the above transition in style has moved the bottleneck in accuracy to word
segmentation. Hence, in this paper, we propose a natural and logical
progression from word level OCR to line-level OCR. The proposal allows to
bypass errors in word detection, and provides larger sentence context for
better utilization of language models. We show that the proposed technique not
only improves the accuracy but also efficiency of OCR. Despite our thorough
literature survey, we did not find any public dataset to train and benchmark
such shift from word to line-level OCR. Hence, we also contribute a
meticulously curated dataset of 251 English page images with line-level
annotations. Our experimentation revealed a notable end-to-end accuracy
improvement of 5.4%, underscoring the potential benefits of transitioning
towards line-level OCR, especially for document images. We also report a 4
times improvement in efficiency compared to word-based pipelines. With
continuous improvements in large language models, our methodology also holds
potential to exploit such advances. Project Website:

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种深度展开网络（DUN），通过自适应带宽保留模型（ABPM）和相位域复值去噪器（PCD）改进CGH算法，解决了现有方法的局限性，并实现了超过35 dB的PSNR。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度学习生成的CGH算法存在非线性、病态性问题，且CNN模型感受野有限，ASM方法仅适用于有限近场，导致重建不准确且灵活性不足。

Method: 提出DUN网络，将梯度下降分解为ABPM和PCD两部分：ABPM扩展工作距离，PCD通过复值变形自注意力模块捕捉全局特征。

Result: 在仿真和真实数据实验中，DUN实现了超过35 dB的PSNR，表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DUN通过物理启发的模块化设计解决了CGH中的局限性，提供了更高性能和灵活性。

Abstract: Computer-generated holography (CGH) has gained wide attention with deep
learning-based algorithms. However, due to its nonlinear and ill-posed nature,
challenges remain in achieving accurate and stable reconstruction.
Specifically, ($i$) the widely used end-to-end networks treat the
reconstruction model as a black box, ignoring underlying physical
relationships, which reduces interpretability and flexibility. ($ii$) CNN-based
CGH algorithms have limited receptive fields, hindering their ability to
capture long-range dependencies and global context. ($iii$) Angular spectrum
method (ASM)-based models are constrained to finite near-fields.In this paper,
we propose a Deep Unfolding Network (DUN) that decomposes gradient descent into
two modules: an adaptive bandwidth-preserving model (ABPM) and a phase-domain
complex-valued denoiser (PCD), providing more flexibility. ABPM allows for
wider working distances compared to ASM-based methods. At the same time, PCD
leverages its complex-valued deformable self-attention module to capture global
features and enhance performance, achieving a PSNR over 35 dB. Experiments on
simulated and real data show state-of-the-art results.

TL;DR: 该研究扩展了nnU-Net框架，使其支持用户交互提示，通过EDT编码和模拟用户交互提高分割性能，在多中心PET/CT中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于示踪剂异质性、生理摄取和多中心变异性，全身PET/CT中的精确病灶分割仍然具有挑战性。尽管自动化方法已有显著进展，但临床实践需要能够高效细化预测掩模的交互式方法。

Method: 研究在autoPET III nnU-Net框架基础上扩展了可提示能力，通过将用户提供的前景和背景点击编码为额外输入通道，并系统研究了空间提示的表示方法，发现EDT编码优于高斯核。此外，还提出了在线模拟用户交互和自定义点采样策略以提高鲁棒性。

Result: 基于EDT的模型集成在交叉验证中表现最强，显著减少了假阳性和假阴性，优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 该研究通过引入可提示模型，展示了在多示踪剂、多中心PET/CT中实现高效用户引导分割的潜力，减少了假阳性和假阴性。

Abstract: Whole-body PET/CT is a cornerstone of oncological imaging, yet accurate
lesion segmentation remains challenging due to tracer heterogeneity,
physiological uptake, and multi-center variability. While fully automated
methods have advanced substantially, clinical practice benefits from approaches
that keep humans in the loop to efficiently refine predicted masks. The
autoPET/CT IV challenge addresses this need by introducing interactive
segmentation tasks based on simulated user prompts. In this work, we present
our submission to Task 1. Building on the winning autoPET III nnU-Net pipeline,
we extend the framework with promptable capabilities by encoding user-provided
foreground and background clicks as additional input channels. We
systematically investigate representations for spatial prompts and demonstrate
that Euclidean Distance Transform (EDT) encodings consistently outperform
Gaussian kernels. Furthermore, we propose online simulation of user
interactions and a custom point sampling strategy to improve robustness under
realistic prompting conditions. Our ensemble of EDT-based models, trained with
and without external data, achieves the strongest cross-validation performance,
reducing both false positives and false negatives compared to baseline models.
These results highlight the potential of promptable models to enable efficient,
user-guided segmentation workflows in multi-tracer, multi-center PET/CT. Code

TL;DR: 通过概率投影机制和置信度分数优化BEV映射，显著提升了HD地图构建的准确性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的高精地图构建方法在投影过程中存在准确性问题，容易出现幻觉现象（hallucination），因此需要一种更精确的几何映射方法来提升HD地图质量。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的概率投影机制，结合置信度分数，用于优化图像空间到BEV空间的映射，并过滤无关元素。此外，通过选择性累积可靠信息改进了时间处理。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在nuScenes和Argoverse2数据集上的性能优于现有技术，尤其在长感知范围内表现出色。

Conclusion: 通过提出的概率投影机制和置信度分数，研究在nuScenes和Argoverse2数据集上实现了优于现有方法的性能，特别是在长感知范围内，展示了更好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Constructing high-definition (HD) maps from sensory input requires accurately
mapping the road elements in image space to the Bird's Eye View (BEV) space.
The precision of this mapping directly impacts the quality of the final
vectorized HD map. Existing HD mapping approaches outsource the projection to
standard mapping techniques, such as attention-based ones. However, these
methods struggle with accuracy due to generalization problems, often
hallucinating non-existent road elements. Our key idea is to start with a
geometric mapping based on camera parameters and adapt it to the scene to
extract relevant map information from camera images. To implement this, we
propose a novel probabilistic projection mechanism with confidence scores to
(i) refine the mapping to better align with the scene and (ii) filter out
irrelevant elements that should not influence HD map generation. In addition,
we improve temporal processing by using confidence scores to selectively
accumulate reliable information over time. Experiments on new splits of the
nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate improved performance over
state-of-the-art approaches, indicating better generalization. The improvements
are particularly pronounced on nuScenes and in the challenging long perception
range. Our code and model checkpoints are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前扩散模型在数据增强中计算资源需求高的问题，提出更高效的方法。

Method: 使用Flux 1.1 Dev扩散模型，并通过LoRA进行微调，减少计算需求。

Result: 在7个数据集上验证，FLORA仅用500张图像即可在mAP@.50:.95上提升21.3%。

Conclusion: FLORA以更低的数据和计算成本超越了现有方法，证明了高效方法的优势。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based generative models have demonstrated
significant potential in augmenting scarce datasets for object detection tasks.
Nevertheless, most recent models rely on resource-intensive full fine-tuning of
large-scale diffusion models, requiring enterprise-grade GPUs (e.g., NVIDIA
V100) and thousands of synthetic images. To address these limitations, we
propose Flux LoRA Augmentation (FLORA), a lightweight synthetic data generation
pipeline. Our approach uses the Flux 1.1 Dev diffusion model, fine-tuned
exclusively through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). This dramatically reduces
computational requirements, enabling synthetic dataset generation with a
consumer-grade GPU (e.g., NVIDIA RTX 4090). We empirically evaluate our
approach on seven diverse object detection datasets. Our results demonstrate
that training object detectors with just 500 synthetic images generated by our
approach yields superior detection performance compared to models trained on
5000 synthetic images from the ODGEN baseline, achieving improvements of up to
21.3% in mAP@.50:.95. This work demonstrates that it is possible to surpass
state-of-the-art performance with far greater efficiency, as FLORA achieves
superior results using only 10% of the data and a fraction of the computational
cost. This work demonstrates that a quality and efficiency-focused approach is
more effective than brute-force generation, making advanced synthetic data
creation more practical and accessible for real-world scenarios.

Motivation: 现有的对抗性输入检测方法成本高、需要修改网络结构或影响模型性能。本文旨在找到一种无需修改模型即可检测对抗性输入的方法。

Method: 利用并行熵监测技术，在VGG-16模型中检测对抗性输入导致的激活层熵变化。

Result: 研究发现，对抗性输入会导致早期卷积层的激活熵变化7%，检测准确率达90%，假阳性和假阴性率低于20%。

Conclusion: 该论文表明，通过监测CNN激活层的熵变化，可以在不修改模型的情况下有效检测对抗性输入，且不影响原始模型的性能。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become the foundation of modern
computer vision, achieving unprecedented accuracy across diverse image
recognition tasks. While these networks excel on in-distribution data, they
remain vulnerable to adversarial perturbations imperceptible input
modifications that cause misclassification with high confidence. However,
existing detection methods either require expensive retraining, modify network
architecture, or degrade performance on clean inputs. Here we show that
adversarial perturbations create immediate, detectable entropy signatures in
CNN activations that can be monitored without any model modification. Using
parallel entropy monitoring on VGG-16, we demonstrate that adversarial inputs
consistently shift activation entropy by 7% in early convolutional layers,
enabling 90% detection accuracy with false positives and false negative rates
below 20%. The complete separation between clean and adversarial entropy
distributions reveals that CNNs inherently encode distribution shifts in their
activation patterns. This work establishes that CNN reliability can be assessed
through activation entropy alone, enabling practical deployment of
self-diagnostic vision systems that detect adversarial inputs in real-time
without compromising original model performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在现实条件下（如杂波、遮挡、极端视角和运动模糊）处理DMD任务的性能不足，促使开发了一种能够生成合成数据集的工具。

Method: 通过结合3D CAD模型、高级渲染和高保真图像合成技术，开发了CAD2DMD-SET工具，生成多样化的合成DMD数据集，并利用DMDBench作为验证集进行评估。

Result: 使用CAD2DMD-SET生成的合成数据集对三种最先进的LVLM进行微调后，模型性能显著提升，其中InternVL的得分提高了200%且不影响其他任务。

Conclusion: CAD2DMD-SET工具的引入显著提升了大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）在处理数字测量设备（DMD）相关任务中的性能，尤其是在复杂现实条件下的表现。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated
impressive capabilities across various multimodal tasks. They continue,
however, to struggle with trivial scenarios such as reading values from Digital
Measurement Devices (DMDs), particularly in real-world conditions involving
clutter, occlusions, extreme viewpoints, and motion blur; common in
head-mounted cameras and Augmented Reality (AR) applications. Motivated by
these limitations, this work introduces CAD2DMD-SET, a synthetic data
generation tool designed to support visual question answering (VQA) tasks
involving DMDs. By leveraging 3D CAD models, advanced rendering, and
high-fidelity image composition, our tool produces diverse, VQA-labelled
synthetic DMD datasets suitable for fine-tuning LVLMs. Additionally, we present
DMDBench, a curated validation set of 1,000 annotated real-world images
designed to evaluate model performance under practical constraints.
Benchmarking three state-of-the-art LVLMs using Average Normalised Levenshtein
Similarity (ANLS) and further fine-tuning LoRA's of these models with
CAD2DMD-SET's generated dataset yielded substantial improvements, with InternVL
showcasing a score increase of 200% without degrading on other tasks. This
demonstrates that the CAD2DMD-SET training dataset substantially improves the
robustness and performance of LVLMs when operating under the previously stated
challenging conditions. The CAD2DMD-SET tool is expected to be released as
open-source once the final version of this manuscript is prepared, allowing the
community to add different measurement devices and generate their own datasets.

Motivation: 现有方法在低音频-视觉语义对应情况下（如沉默、噪声和屏幕外声音）表现不佳，且评估局限于正音频场景。

Method: 提出了一个新的训练策略，包含沉默和噪声处理，改进了模型在正负音频情况下的表现。此外，提出了一个新的评估指标和扩展的数据集IS3+。

Conclusion: 本文提出了SSL-SaN模型，通过新的训练策略解决了当前方法在负音频情况下的性能问题，同时在声音定位和跨模态检索任务中达到了SOTA性能。

Abstract: Visual sound source localization is a fundamental perception task that aims
to detect the location of sounding sources in a video given its audio. Despite
recent progress, we identify two shortcomings in current methods: 1) most
approaches perform poorly in cases with low audio-visual semantic
correspondence such as silence, noise, and offscreen sounds, i.e. in the
presence of negative audio; and 2) most prior evaluations are limited to
positive cases, where both datasets and metrics convey scenarios with a single
visible sound source in the scene. To address this, we introduce three key
contributions. First, we propose a new training strategy that incorporates
silence and noise, which improves performance in positive cases, while being
more robust against negative sounds. Our resulting self-supervised model,
SSL-SaN, achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other
self-supervised models, both in sound localization and cross-modal retrieval.
Second, we propose a new metric that quantifies the trade-off between alignment
and separability of auditory and visual features across positive and negative
audio-visual pairs. Third, we present IS3+, an extended and improved version of
the IS3 synthetic dataset with negative audio.

Motivation: GUI代理是迈向通用人工智能的重要任务，但由于操作轨迹稀缺、交互基础设施不足以及基础模型能力有限，开发GUI代理仍具挑战性。

Method: UItron通过系统性数据工程和交互基础设施，采用监督微调和课程强化学习框架，增强GUI感知和规划能力。

Abstract: GUI agent aims to enable automated operations on Mobile/PC devices, which is
an important task toward achieving artificial general intelligence. The rapid
advancement of VLMs accelerates the development of GUI agents, owing to their
powerful capabilities in visual understanding and task planning. However,
building a GUI agent remains a challenging task due to the scarcity of
operation trajectories, the availability of interactive infrastructure, and the
limitation of initial capabilities in foundation models. In this work, we
introduce UItron, an open-source foundational model for automatic GUI agents,
featuring advanced GUI perception, grounding, and planning capabilities. UItron
highlights the necessity of systemic data engineering and interactive
infrastructure as foundational components for advancing GUI agent development.
It not only systematically studies a series of data engineering strategies to
enhance training effects, but also establishes an interactive environment
connecting both Mobile and PC devices. In training, UItron adopts supervised
finetuning over perception and planning tasks in various GUI scenarios, and
then develop a curriculum reinforcement learning framework to enable complex
reasoning and exploration for online environments. As a result, UItron achieves
superior performance in benchmarks of GUI perception, grounding, and planning.
In particular, UItron highlights the interaction proficiency with top-tier
Chinese mobile APPs, as we identified a general lack of Chinese capabilities
even in state-of-the-art solutions. To this end, we manually collect over one
million steps of operation trajectories across the top 100 most popular apps,
and build the offline and online agent evaluation environments. Experimental
results demonstrate that UItron achieves significant progress in Chinese app
scenarios, propelling GUI agents one step closer to real-world application.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的领域泛化（DG）评估方法可能不足以挑战基础模型CLIP，因为其预训练数据可能已覆盖许多现有基准。

Method: 采用了两种方法：1)在ImageNet上微调CLIP并在33个多样化数据集上评估；2)使用遗忘技术模拟域遗忘。

Result: CLIP在更具分布偏移的数据集上表现显著下降，而CLIP-DCA则显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CLIP-DCA通过增强域感知表示并同时鼓励域不变分类，显著提升了在更具分布偏移数据集上的性能。

Abstract: Evaluating domain generalization (DG) for foundational models like CLIP is
challenging, as web-scale pretraining data potentially covers many existing
benchmarks. Consequently, current DG evaluation may neither be sufficiently
challenging nor adequately test genuinely unseen data scenarios. To better
assess the performance of CLIP on DG in-the-wild, a scenario where CLIP
encounters challenging unseen data, we consider two approaches: (1) evaluating
on 33 diverse datasets with quantified out-of-distribution (OOD) scores after
fine-tuning CLIP on ImageNet, and (2) using unlearning to make CLIP `forget'
some domains as an approximation. We observe that CLIP's performance
deteriorates significantly on more OOD datasets. To address this, we present
CLIP-DCA (Disentangling Classification from enhanced domain Aware
representations). Our approach is motivated by the observation that while
standard domain invariance losses aim to make representations domain-invariant,
this can be harmful to foundation models by forcing the discarding of
domain-aware representations beneficial for generalization. We instead
hypothesize that enhancing domain awareness is a prerequisite for effective
domain-invariant classification in foundation models. CLIP-DCA identifies and
enhances domain awareness within CLIP's encoders using a separate domain head
and synthetically generated diverse domain data. Simultaneously, it encourages
domain-invariant classification through disentanglement from the domain
features. CLIP-DCA shows significant improvements within this challenging
evaluation compared to existing methods, particularly on datasets that are more
OOD.

Motivation: 探索非典型视频数据在开放世界学习中的潜力，填补现有研究中典型数据集的不足。

Method: 收集非典型视频数据集，并将其用于模型训练的表示学习，重点关注OOD检测、NCD和ZSAR任务。

Result: 非典型数据能显著提升性能，尤其是在OOD检测中增加类别多样性表现更佳，NCD任务中小规模但语义多样数据集表现更好，ZSAR任务中语义多样性帮助模型泛化。

Conclusion: 非典型视频数据对开放世界学习有显著益处，鼓励未来进一步研究。

Abstract: Humans usually show exceptional generalisation and discovery ability in the
open world, when being shown uncommon new concepts. Whereas most existing
studies in the literature focus on common typical data from closed sets,
open-world novel discovery is under-explored in videos. In this paper, we are
interested in asking: \textit{What if atypical unusual videos are exposed in
the learning process?} To this end, we collect a new video dataset consisting
of various types of unusual atypical data (\eg sci-fi, animation, \etc). To
study how such atypical data may benefit open-world learning, we feed them into
the model training process for representation learning. Focusing on three key
tasks in open-world learning: out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, novel
category discovery (NCD), and zero-shot action recognition (ZSAR), we found
that even straightforward learning approaches with atypical data consistently
improve performance across various settings. Furthermore, we found that
increasing the categorical diversity of the atypical samples further boosts OOD
detection performance. Additionally, in the NCD task, using a smaller yet more
semantically diverse set of atypical samples leads to better performance
compared to using a larger but more typical dataset. In the ZSAR setting, the
semantic diversity of atypical videos helps the model generalise better to
unseen action classes. These observations in our extensive experimental
evaluations reveal the benefits of atypical videos for visual representation
learning in the open world, together with the newly proposed dataset,
encouraging further studies in this direction.

Motivation: 现有的监督持续学习方法依赖标签和任务边界，而实际应用中获取标签数据成本高且不切实际，因此研究无监督视频持续学习具有重要意义。

Method: 利用无监督视频变换器网络提取深度嵌入视频特征的核密度估计作为数据的非参数概率表示，并引入新颖性检测标准动态扩展内存聚类。

Conclusion: 论文提出的无监督视频持续学习方法显著提升了模型在连续任务学习中的性能，并通过大量实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: We propose a realistic scenario for the unsupervised video learning where
neither task boundaries nor labels are provided when learning a succession of
tasks. We also provide a non-parametric learning solution for the
under-explored problem of unsupervised video continual learning. Videos
represent a complex and rich spatio-temporal media information, widely used in
many applications, but which have not been sufficiently explored in
unsupervised continual learning. Prior studies have only focused on supervised
continual learning, relying on the knowledge of labels and task boundaries,
while having labeled data is costly and not practical. To address this gap, we
study the unsupervised video continual learning (uVCL). uVCL raises more
challenges due to the additional computational and memory requirements of
processing videos when compared to images. We introduce a general benchmark
experimental protocol for uVCL by considering the learning of unstructured
video data categories during each task. We propose to use the Kernel Density
Estimation (KDE) of deep embedded video features extracted by unsupervised
video transformer networks as a non-parametric probabilistic representation of
the data. We introduce a novelty detection criterion for the incoming new task
data, dynamically enabling the expansion of memory clusters, aiming to capture
new knowledge when learning a succession of tasks. We leverage the use of
transfer learning from the previous tasks as an initial state for the knowledge
transfer to the current learning task. We found that the proposed methodology
substantially enhances the performance of the model when successively learning
many tasks. We perform in-depth evaluations on three standard video action
recognition datasets, including UCF101, HMDB51, and Something-to-Something V2,
without using any labels or class boundaries.

Abstract: Automated segmentation of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) from MRI is
critical for clinical workflows but is hindered by poor tumor-tissue contrast
and a scarcity of annotated data. This paper details our submission to the
PANTHER challenge, addressing both diagnostic T1-weighted (Task 1) and
therapeutic T2-weighted (Task 2) segmentation. Our approach is built upon the
nnU-Net framework and leverages a deep, multi-stage cascaded pre-training
strategy, starting from a general anatomical foundation model and sequentially
fine-tuning on CT pancreatic lesion datasets and the target MRI modalities.
Through extensive five-fold cross-validation, we systematically evaluated data
augmentation schemes and training schedules. Our analysis revealed a critical
trade-off, where aggressive data augmentation produced the highest volumetric
accuracy, while default augmentations yielded superior boundary precision
(achieving a state-of-the-art MASD of 5.46 mm and HD95 of 17.33 mm for Task 1).
For our final submission, we exploited this finding by constructing custom,
heterogeneous ensembles of specialist models, essentially creating a mix of
experts. This metric-aware ensembling strategy proved highly effective,
achieving a top cross-validation Tumor Dice score of 0.661 for Task 1 and 0.523
for Task 2. Our work presents a robust methodology for developing specialized,
high-performance models in the context of limited data and complex medical
imaging tasks (Team MIC-DKFZ).

TL;DR: GPT-5在放射肿瘤学测试中表现优异，但需进一步优化和专家监督。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型在临床决策支持中的潜力，尤其是在肿瘤学领域。

Method: 使用TXIT考试和真实案例评估GPT-5的性能，并由专家评分。

Result: GPT-5在多项测试中优于前代模型，但在复杂情况下仍有改进空间。

Conclusion: GPT-5在放射肿瘤学领域表现出卓越的性能，但仍需专家监督以确保临床应用的准确性。

Abstract: Introduction: Large language models (LLM) have shown great potential in
clinical decision support. GPT-5 is a novel LLM system that has been
specifically marketed towards oncology use.
  Methods: Performance was assessed using two complementary benchmarks: (i) the
ACR Radiation Oncology In-Training Examination (TXIT, 2021), comprising 300
multiple-choice items, and (ii) a curated set of 60 authentic radiation
oncologic vignettes representing diverse disease sites and treatment
indications. For the vignette evaluation, GPT-5 was instructed to generate
concise therapeutic plans. Four board-certified radiation oncologists rated
correctness, comprehensiveness, and hallucinations. Inter-rater reliability was
quantified using Fleiss' \k{appa}.
  Results: On the TXIT benchmark, GPT-5 achieved a mean accuracy of 92.8%,
outperforming GPT-4 (78.8%) and GPT-3.5 (62.1%). Domain-specific gains were
most pronounced in Dose and Diagnosis. In the vignette evaluation, GPT-5's
treatment recommendations were rated highly for correctness (mean 3.24/4, 95%
CI: 3.11-3.38) and comprehensiveness (3.59/4, 95% CI: 3.49-3.69).
Hallucinations were rare with no case reaching majority consensus for their
presence. Inter-rater agreement was low (Fleiss' \k{appa} 0.083 for
correctness), reflecting inherent variability in clinical judgment. Errors
clustered in complex scenarios requiring precise trial knowledge or detailed
clinical adaptation.
  Discussion: GPT-5 clearly outperformed prior model variants on the radiation
oncology multiple-choice benchmark. Although GPT-5 exhibited favorable
performance in generating real-world radiation oncology treatment
recommendations, correctness ratings indicate room for further improvement.
While hallucinations were infrequent, the presence of substantive errors
underscores that GPT-5-generated recommendations require rigorous expert
oversight before clinical implementation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于正常数据的稀缺性，异常检测具有挑战性，传统方法依赖于精心设计的图像特征提取器和记忆库，但效果有限。

Method: 提出了一种名为 TMUAD 的三记忆库框架，包括类级文本记忆库、对象级图像记忆库和补丁级记忆库，用于多层次的异常检测。

Result: TMUAD 在工业和医疗领域的七个公开数据集上表现优异，达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: TMUAD 通过整合结构性和逻辑性异常检测，利用协作记忆库，在多个公开数据集上取得了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Anomaly detection, which aims to identify anomalies deviating from normal
patterns, is challenging due to the limited amount of normal data available.
Unlike most existing unified methods that rely on carefully designed image
feature extractors and memory banks to capture logical relationships between
objects, we introduce a text memory bank to enhance the detection of logical
anomalies. Specifically, we propose a Three-Memory framework for Unified
structural and logical Anomaly Detection (TMUAD). First, we build a class-level
text memory bank for logical anomaly detection by the proposed logic-aware text
extractor, which can capture rich logical descriptions of objects from input
images. Second, we construct an object-level image memory bank that preserves
complete object contours by extracting features from segmented objects. Third,
we employ visual encoders to extract patch-level image features for
constructing a patch-level memory bank for structural anomaly detection. These
three complementary memory banks are used to retrieve and compare normal images
that are most similar to the query image, compute anomaly scores at multiple
levels, and fuse them into a final anomaly score. By unifying structural and
logical anomaly detection through collaborative memory banks, TMUAD achieves
state-of-the-art performance across seven publicly available datasets involving
industrial and medical domains. The model and code are available at
https://github.com/SIA-IDE/TMUAD.

Motivation: 解决视频理解中细粒度定位和语义属性描述的困难，同时减轻数据标注的昂贵成本。

Method: VoCap通过多模态提示（文本、框或掩码）处理视频，生成时空掩码和对象描述。使用伪标注技术增强现有数据集，并通过VLM生成对象描述。

Result: VoCap在引用表达视频对象分割任务中达到最优，在半监督视频对象分割中表现优秀，并建立了视频对象描述的新基准。

Conclusion: VoCap模型在视频对象分割、引用表达分割和对象描述任务中表现出色，并建立了视频对象描述的新基准。数据集SAV-Caption将在GitHub上公开供研究使用。

Abstract: Understanding objects in videos in terms of fine-grained localization masks
and detailed semantic properties is a fundamental task in video understanding.
In this paper, we propose VoCap, a flexible video model that consumes a video
and a prompt of various modalities (text, box or mask), and produces a
spatio-temporal masklet with a corresponding object-centric caption. As such
our model addresses simultaneously the tasks of promptable video object
segmentation, referring expression segmentation, and object captioning. Since
obtaining data for this task is tedious and expensive, we propose to annotate
an existing large-scale segmentation dataset (SAV) with pseudo object captions.
We do so by preprocessing videos with their ground-truth masks to highlight the
object of interest and feed this to a large Vision Language Model (VLM). For an
unbiased evaluation, we collect manual annotations on the validation set. We
call the resulting dataset SAV-Caption. We train our VoCap model at scale on a
SAV-Caption together with a mix of other image and video datasets. Our model
yields state-of-the-art results on referring expression video object
segmentation, is competitive on semi-supervised video object segmentation, and
establishes a benchmark for video object captioning. Our dataset will be made
available at https://github.com/google-deepmind/vocap.

Motivation: 现有方法将动词分类视为单标签问题，忽略了视觉事件识别中的模糊性，导致性能受限。

Method: 提出SPMLL问题框架，并开发GE-VerbMLP模型，结合图神经网络和对抗训练。

Result: 在真实数据集上取得了超过3%的平均精度提升，同时在传统指标上保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 多标签视角更符合动词分类的实际需求，SPMLL和GE-VerbMLP为上下文识别提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Context recognition (SR) is a fundamental task in computer vision that aims
to extract structured semantic summaries from images by identifying key events
and their associated entities. Specifically, given an input image, the model
must first classify the main visual events (verb classification), then identify
the participating entities and their semantic roles (semantic role labeling),
and finally localize these entities in the image (semantic role localization).
Existing methods treat verb classification as a single-label problem, but we
show through a comprehensive analysis that this formulation fails to address
the inherent ambiguity in visual event recognition, as multiple verb categories
may reasonably describe the same image. This paper makes three key
contributions: First, we reveal through empirical analysis that verb
classification is inherently a multi-label problem due to the ubiquitous
semantic overlap between verb categories. Second, given the impracticality of
fully annotating large-scale datasets with multiple labels, we propose to
reformulate verb classification as a single positive multi-label learning
(SPMLL) problem - a novel perspective in SR research. Third, we design a
comprehensive multi-label evaluation benchmark for SR that is carefully
designed to fairly evaluate model performance in a multi-label setting. To
address the challenges of SPMLL, we futher develop the Graph Enhanced Verb
Multilayer Perceptron (GE-VerbMLP), which combines graph neural networks to
capture label correlations and adversarial training to optimize decision
boundaries. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that our approach
achieves more than 3\% MAP improvement while remaining competitive on
traditional top-1 and top-5 accuracy metrics.

TL;DR: 本文提出DriveQA基准测试，发现LLM和MLLM在复杂驾驶场景中表现不足，但微调和预训练可显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动驾驶基准测试缺乏对交通规则、标志和优先权的全面理解，而人类驾驶员需要掌握这些知识以应对罕见边缘情况。

Method: 研究者通过构建DriveQA这一开源的文本和视觉基准数据集，并对LLM和MLLM进行微调实验。

Result: 实验显示，LLM和MLLM在基础交通规则上表现良好，但在数值推理、复杂优先权场景和交通标志识别上显著不足。微调后性能提升，特别是在标志识别和交叉路口决策方面。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，DriveQA数据集不仅能提升LLM和MLLM在驾驶知识测试中的表现，还能增强其在真实世界驾驶任务中的泛化能力。

Abstract: If a Large Language Model (LLM) were to take a driving knowledge test today,
would it pass? Beyond standard spatial and visual question-answering (QA) tasks
on current autonomous driving benchmarks, driving knowledge tests require a
complete understanding of all traffic rules, signage, and right-of-way
principles. To pass this test, human drivers must discern various edge cases
that rarely appear in real-world datasets. In this work, we present DriveQA, an
extensive open-source text and vision-based benchmark that exhaustively covers
traffic regulations and scenarios. Through our experiments using DriveQA, we
show that (1) state-of-the-art LLMs and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) perform well on
basic traffic rules but exhibit significant weaknesses in numerical reasoning
and complex right-of-way scenarios, traffic sign variations, and spatial
layouts, (2) fine-tuning on DriveQA improves accuracy across multiple
categories, particularly in regulatory sign recognition and intersection
decision-making, (3) controlled variations in DriveQA-V provide insights into
model sensitivity to environmental factors such as lighting, perspective,
distance, and weather conditions, and (4) pretraining on DriveQA enhances
downstream driving task performance, leading to improved results on real-world
datasets such as nuScenes and BDD, while also demonstrating that models can
internalize text and synthetic traffic knowledge to generalize effectively
across downstream QA tasks.

Motivation: 解决深度学习模型在训练数据中学习和利用伪相关性导致的性能下降和泛化能力差的问题。

Method: CoBA分解文本为语义三元组，选择性修改这些三元组以破坏伪相关性，然后重构文本生成反偏见数据。

Result: 实验表明，CoBA不仅提高了下游任务性能，还减少了偏见并增强了分布外数据的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CoBA通过分解和修改语义三元组，提出了一种有效的反偏数据增强方法，显著提高了模型的泛化能力和鲁棒性，同时减少了偏见。

Abstract: Deep learning models often learn and exploit spurious correlations in
training data, using these non-target features to inform their predictions.
Such reliance leads to performance degradation and poor generalization on
unseen data. To address these limitations, we introduce a more general form of
counterfactual data augmentation, termed counterbias data augmentation, which
simultaneously tackles multiple biases (e.g., gender bias, simplicity bias) and
enhances out-of-distribution robustness. We present CoBA: CounterBias
Augmentation, a unified framework that operates at the semantic triple level:
first decomposing text into subject-predicate-object triples, then selectively
modifying these triples to disrupt spurious correlations. By reconstructing the
text from these adjusted triples, CoBA generates counterbias data that
mitigates spurious patterns. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that
CoBA not only improves downstream task performance, but also effectively
reduces biases and strengthens out-of-distribution resilience, offering a
versatile and robust solution to the challenges posed by spurious correlations.

Motivation: 现有有毒言论数据集缺乏人口统计背景，限制了理解不同年龄群体在线交流的差异。

Method: 通过人类和LLM注释结合的方法，分析了来自Instagram、TikTok和YouTube的30,048条评论，并利用预定义有毒关键词筛选相关内容。

Result: 数据集发现年轻用户偏爱表达性语言，而老年用户更多涉及虚假信息和贬值言论，16.7%的评论被标记为有问题。

Conclusion: 该数据集为研究人口统计的言语差异提供了新资源，支持开发更公平且年龄感知的内容审核系统。

Abstract: A lack of demographic context in existing toxic speech datasets limits our
understanding of how different age groups communicate online. In collaboration
with funk, a German public service content network, this research introduces
the first large-scale German dataset annotated for toxicity and enriched with
platform-provided age estimates. The dataset includes 3,024 human-annotated and
30,024 LLM-annotated anonymized comments from Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube.
To ensure relevance, comments were consolidated using predefined toxic
keywords, resulting in 16.7\% labeled as problematic. The annotation pipeline
combined human expertise with state-of-the-art language models, identifying key
categories such as insults, disinformation, and criticism of broadcasting fees.
The dataset reveals age-based differences in toxic speech patterns, with
younger users favoring expressive language and older users more often engaging
in disinformation and devaluation. This resource provides new opportunities for
studying linguistic variation across demographics and supports the development
of more equitable and age-aware content moderation systems.

Conclusion: BED-LLM通过贝叶斯实验设计框架显著提升了大型语言模型在多轮对话中的信息获取能力，并在多种测试中表现优于直接提示和其他自适应策略。

Abstract: We propose a general-purpose approach for improving the ability of Large
Language Models (LLMs) to intelligently and adaptively gather information from
a user or other external source using the framework of sequential Bayesian
experimental design (BED). This enables LLMs to act as effective multi-turn
conversational agents and interactively interface with external environments.
Our approach, which we call BED-LLM (Bayesian Experimental Design with Large
Language Models), is based on iteratively choosing questions or queries that
maximize the expected information gain (EIG) about the task of interest given
the responses gathered previously. We show how this EIG can be formulated in a
principled way using a probabilistic model derived from the LLM's belief
distribution and provide detailed insights into key decisions in its
construction. Further key to the success of BED-LLM are a number of specific
innovations, such as a carefully designed estimator for the EIG, not solely
relying on in-context updates for conditioning on previous responses, and a
targeted strategy for proposing candidate queries. We find that BED-LLM
achieves substantial gains in performance across a wide range of tests based on
the 20-questions game and using the LLM to actively infer user preferences,
compared to direct prompting of the LLM and other adaptive design strategies.

Motivation: 研究LLMs在价格谈判中的锚定效应，以评估其在实际应用中的可靠性。

Method: 通过指令卖家LLM代理应用锚定效应，并使用客观和主观指标评估谈判结果，同时考察推理能力和人格特质对锚定效应的影响。

Result: LLMs像人类一样受锚定效应影响；推理能力强的模型受影响较小；人格特质与锚定效应的易感性无显著关联。

Conclusion: LLMs受锚定效应影响，类似于人类，但推理能力强的模型受影响较小；人格特质与锚定效应的易感性无显著关联。这些发现有助于更深入地理解LLMs中的认知偏差，并促进其安全、负责任的社会应用。

Abstract: Cognitive biases, well-studied in humans, can also be observed in LLMs,
affecting their reliability in real-world applications. This paper investigates
the anchoring effect in LLM-driven price negotiations. To this end, we
instructed seller LLM agents to apply the anchoring effect and evaluated
negotiations using not only an objective metric but also a subjective metric.
Experimental results show that LLMs are influenced by the anchoring effect like
humans. Additionally, we investigated the relationship between the anchoring
effect and factors such as reasoning and personality. It was shown that
reasoning models are less prone to the anchoring effect, suggesting that the
long chain of thought mitigates the effect. However, we found no significant
correlation between personality traits and susceptibility to the anchoring
effect. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of cognitive biases
in LLMs and to the realization of safe and responsible application of LLMs in
society.

Conclusion: 论文通过引入Percept-V数据集，揭示了当前MLLMs在简单视觉感知任务中的表现随问题复杂度增加而显著下降的趋势，并发现不同认知技能的难度差异。

Abstract: The reasoning abilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
garnered a lot of attention in recent times, with advances made in frontiers
like coding, mathematics, and science. However, very limited experiments have
been done to assess their performance in simple perception tasks performed over
uncontaminated, generated images containing basic shapes and structures. To
address this issue, the paper introduces a dataset, Percept-V, containing a
total of 7200 program-generated images equally divided into 30 categories, each
testing a combination of visual perception skills. Unlike previously proposed
datasets, Percept-V comprises very basic tasks of varying complexity that test
the perception abilities of MLLMs. This dataset is then tested on
state-of-the-art MLLMs like GPT-4o, Gemini, and Claude as well as Large
Reasoning Models (LRMs) like OpenAI o4-mini and DeepSeek R1 to gauge their
performance. Contrary to the evidence that MLLMs excel in many complex tasks,
our experiments show a significant drop in the models' performance with
increasing problem complexity across all categories. An analysis of the
performances also reveals that the tested MLLMs exhibit a similar trend in
accuracy across categories, testing a particular cognitive skill and find some
skills to be more difficult than others.

TL;DR: 本文通过数据中心的视角，系统综述了Sci-LLMs的发展、挑战和评估方法，并提出了未来闭环系统的研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学数据的复杂性（多模态、跨尺度、领域特定）使得Sci-LLMs的发展面临独特挑战，需要通过数据中心化的方法重新思考其发展路径。

Method: 通过统一的科学数据分类法和科学知识的层次模型，系统回顾了近期的Sci-LLMs，并分析了270多个预训练/后训练数据集。

Result: 研究发现Sci-LLMs需要处理异构、多尺度、不确定性高的语料，并在190多个基准数据集上验证了评估范式的转变。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一个以数据为中心的科学生成大语言模型（Sci-LLMs）发展框架，强调了模型与数据基质的共进化关系，并为构建可信赖、持续进化的AI系统提供了路线图。

Abstract: Scientific Large Language Models (Sci-LLMs) are transforming how knowledge is
represented, integrated, and applied in scientific research, yet their progress
is shaped by the complex nature of scientific data. This survey presents a
comprehensive, data-centric synthesis that reframes the development of Sci-LLMs
as a co-evolution between models and their underlying data substrate. We
formulate a unified taxonomy of scientific data and a hierarchical model of
scientific knowledge, emphasizing the multimodal, cross-scale, and
domain-specific challenges that differentiate scientific corpora from general
natural language processing datasets. We systematically review recent Sci-LLMs,
from general-purpose foundations to specialized models across diverse
scientific disciplines, alongside an extensive analysis of over 270
pre-/post-training datasets, showing why Sci-LLMs pose distinct demands --
heterogeneous, multi-scale, uncertainty-laden corpora that require
representations preserving domain invariance and enabling cross-modal
reasoning. On evaluation, we examine over 190 benchmark datasets and trace a
shift from static exams toward process- and discovery-oriented assessments with
advanced evaluation protocols. These data-centric analyses highlight persistent
issues in scientific data development and discuss emerging solutions involving
semi-automated annotation pipelines and expert validation. Finally, we outline
a paradigm shift toward closed-loop systems where autonomous agents based on
Sci-LLMs actively experiment, validate, and contribute to a living, evolving
knowledge base. Collectively, this work provides a roadmap for building
trustworthy, continually evolving artificial intelligence (AI) systems that
function as a true partner in accelerating scientific discovery.

### [68] [Quantifying Label-Induced Bias in Large Language Model Self- and Cross-Evaluations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21164)
*Muskan Saraf,Sajjad Rezvani Boroujeni,Justin Beaudry,Hossein Abedi,Tom Bush*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型的评估结果易受模型标签影响，需采用盲评或多模型评估协议以确保公平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型在评估过程中可能存在的偏见，特别是模型标签对评估结果的影响，以揭示评估协议的不公平性。

Method: 研究通过三种模型（ChatGPT、Gemini和Claude）在四种标签条件下（无标签、真实标签和两种虚假标签）对博客文章进行评估，采用整体偏好投票和三个质量维度（连贯性、信息量和简洁性）的评分。

Result: 研究显示模型标签对评估结果具有显著影响，尤其是Claude标签普遍提高分数，而Gemini标签则降低分数。虚假标签甚至导致排名逆转，偏好投票和质量评分分别出现50%和12%的变化。

Conclusion: 该研究表明，大型语言模型（LLM）的评估结果可能受到模型标签的显著影响，尤其是在自评和跨模型评估中。为确保公平性，建议采用盲评或多模型评估协议。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to evaluate outputs, yet
their judgments may be influenced. This study examines bias in self- and
cross-model evaluations by ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude under four conditions:
no labels, true labels, and two false-label scenarios. Blog posts authored by
each model were evaluated by all three using both overall preference voting and
quality ratings for Coherence, Informativeness, and Conciseness, with all
scores expressed as percentages for direct comparison. Results reveal striking
asymmetries: the "Claude" label consistently boosts scores, while the "Gemini"
label consistently depresses them, regardless of actual content. False labels
frequently reversed rankings, producing shifts of up to 50 percentage points in
preference votes and up to 12 percentage points in converted quality ratings.
Gemini's self-scores collapsed under true labels, while Claude's
self-preference intensified. These findings show that perceived model identity
can heavily distort high-level judgments and subtly influence detailed quality
ratings, underscoring the need for blind or multimodel evaluation protocols to
ensure fairness in LLM benchmarking.

*Arash Ahmadi,Sarah Sharif,Yaser Banad*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于强化学习的自动化HFACS分类框架，优化后的模型在航空安全分析中表现出色，且适合资源有限的设备部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统航空事故人为因素分析方法（如HFACS）在可扩展性和一致性方面存在局限，亟需一种自动化的解决方案以提高分析的准确性和效率。

Method: 提出了一种自动化的HFACS分类框架，利用基于Group Relative Policy Optimization（GRPO）的强化学习对Llama-3.1 8B语言模型进行微调，并结合多组件奖励系统和合成数据生成技术应对数据类别不平衡问题。

Result: GRPO优化的模型在精确匹配准确率上提升了350%（从0.0400提升至0.1800），部分匹配准确率达到0.8800，显著优于GPT-5-mini和Gemini-2.5-fiash等先进语言模型。

Conclusion: 研究表明，领域优化的较小模型在计算效率和性能上优于通用大型语言模型，为关键安全分析提供了有效的解决方案，并支持在资源有限的边缘设备上低延迟部署。

Abstract: Analyzing the human factors behind aviation accidents is crucial for
preventing future incidents, yet traditional methods using the Human Factors
Analysis and Classification System (HFACS) are limited by scalability and
consistency. To address this, we introduce an automated HFACS classification
framework for aviation safety analysis that utilizes Reinforcement Learning
with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to fine-tune a Llama-3.1 8B
language model. Our approach incorporates a multi-component reward system
tailored for aviation safety analysis and integrates synthetic data generation
to overcome class imbalance in accident datasets. The resulting GRPO-optimized
model achieved noticeable performance gains, including a 350% increase in exact
match accuracy (from 0.0400 to 0.1800) and an improved partial match accuracy
of 0.8800. Significantly, our specialized model outperforms state-of-the-art
LLMs (Large Language Models), including GPT-5-mini and Gemini-2.5-fiash, on key
metrics. This research also proposes exact match accuracy in multi-label HFACS
classification problem as a new benchmarking methodology to evaluate the
advanced reasoning capabilities of language models. Ultimately, our work
validates that smaller, domain-optimized models can provide a computationally
efficient and better solution for critical safety analysis. This approach makes
powerful, low-latency deployment on resource-constrained edge devices feasible.

### [70] [Enhancing Robustness of Autoregressive Language Models against Orthographic Attacks via Pixel-based Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21206)
*Han Yang,Jian Lan,Yihong Liu,Hinrich Schütze,Thomas Seidl*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出像素基语言模型解决拼写攻击问题，增强鲁棒性和多语言兼容性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归语言模型容易受到拼写攻击，当输入文本被多语言字符扰动时，模型性能会显著下降。这主要是由于子词标记器及其嵌入的词汇表外问题所导致。

Method: 提出一种基于像素的生成语言模型，通过将单词渲染为图像来替代传统文本嵌入，增强了模型对噪声输入的鲁棒性，并提升了对多语言文本的兼容性。

Result: 在LAMBADA多语言数据集、WMT24数据集和SST-2基准测试上的评估表明，该方法对拼写噪声具有较强的鲁棒性，同时在多语言环境下表现有效。

Conclusion: 像素基生成语言模型能有效提升对多语言文本和噪声输入的处理能力，解决了传统自回归语言模型在拼写攻击下的脆弱性问题。

Abstract: Autoregressive language models are vulnerable to orthographic attacks, where
input text is perturbed with characters from multilingual alphabets, leading to
substantial performance degradation. This vulnerability primarily stems from
the out-of-vocabulary issue inherent in subword tokenizers and their
embeddings. To address this limitation, we propose a pixel-based generative
language model that replaces the text-based embeddings with pixel-based
representations by rendering words as individual images. This design provides
stronger robustness to noisy inputs, while an extension of compatibility to
multilingual text across diverse writing systems. We evaluate the proposed
method on the multilingual LAMBADA dataset, WMT24 dataset and the SST-2
benchmark, demonstrating both its resilience to orthographic noise and its
effectiveness in multilingual settings.

### [71] [Do Self-Supervised Speech Models Exhibit the Critical Period Effects in Language Acquisition?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21210)
*Yurie Koga,Shunsuke Kando,Yusuke Miyao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 语音模型中是否观察到关键期效应？研究发现，自监督语音模型在音位学习上未表现出明显关键期效应，且延迟L2暴露可能导致L1遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索关键期效应（CP）在自监督语音模型（S3Ms）中的表现，填补语音模型在此领域的空白。

Method: 通过在不同L2训练起始和L1训练结束时间下训练S3Ms，并评估其音位辨别能力。

Result: S3Ms未显示明显的CP效应；延迟L2暴露模型在L2表现更好，延迟L1暴露导致L1遗忘。

Conclusion: 语音模型在音位学习上的关键期效应不明显，与人类语言学习有所不同。

Abstract: This paper investigates whether the Critical Period (CP) effects in human
language acquisition are observed in self-supervised speech models (S3Ms). CP
effects refer to greater difficulty in acquiring a second language (L2) with
delayed L2 exposure onset, and greater retention of their first language (L1)
with delayed L1 exposure offset. While previous work has studied these effects
using textual language models, their presence in speech models remains
underexplored despite the central role of spoken language in human language
acquisition. We train S3Ms with varying L2 training onsets and L1 training
offsets on child-directed speech and evaluate their phone discrimination
performance. We find that S3Ms do not exhibit clear evidence of either CP
effects in terms of phonological acquisition. Notably, models with delayed L2
exposure onset tend to perform better on L2 and delayed L1 exposure offset
leads to L1 forgetting.

*Weizhi Gao,Xiaorui Liu,Feiyi Wang,Dan Lu,Junqi Yin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的解码记忆管道（DMP），通过选择性推理和退火解码加速生成，解决了自一致性方法中的冗余问题，显著提高了多响应生成的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在研究和实际应用中表现出色，但仍存在幻觉问题。现有的幻觉检测方法在句子级生成上表现不佳或过于依赖领域知识。自一致性方法虽然有效，但计算成本高昂。

Method: 通过研究自一致性方法中的冗余现象（表现为生成中的共享前缀标记），提出DMP方法，利用选择性推理和退火解码减少计算开销。

Result: 实验表明，DMP能在不牺牲AUROC性能的情况下实现高达3倍的加速。

Conclusion: DMP不仅显著提升了生成效率，还具有扩展到对齐和推理任务的潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in both
research and real-world applications, but they still struggle with
hallucination. Existing hallucination detection methods often perform poorly on
sentence-level generation or rely heavily on domain-specific knowledge. While
self-consistency approaches help address these limitations, they incur high
computational costs due to repeated generation. In this paper, we conduct the
first study on identifying redundancy in self-consistency methods, manifested
as shared prefix tokens across generations, and observe that non-exact-answer
tokens contribute minimally to the semantic content. Based on these insights,
we propose a novel Decoding Memory Pipeline (DMP) that accelerates generation
through selective inference and annealed decoding. Being orthogonal to the
model, dataset, decoding strategy, and self-consistency baseline, our DMP
consistently improves the efficiency of multi-response generation and holds
promise for extension to alignment and reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments
show that our method achieves up to a 3x speedup without sacrificing AUROC
performance.

Result: 尽管模型规模较小，但仍表现出最先进的性能。

Conclusion: jina-code-embeddings通过创新的自回归主干网络和最后令牌池化方法，验证了其在代码嵌入模型构建中的有效性。

Abstract: jina-code-embeddings is a novel code embedding model suite designed to
retrieve code from natural language queries, perform technical
question-answering, and identify semantically similar code snippets across
programming languages. It makes innovative use of an autoregressive backbone
pre-trained on both text and code, generating embeddings via last-token
pooling. We outline the training recipe and demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance despite the relatively small size of the models, validating this
approach to code embedding model construction.

Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLMs）能力的增强，需要更强大的评估方法，特别是在多语言和非英语环境下。

Method: 通过自动生成图像标题和使用最先进的模型来扩展数据集，提高其在数据污染研究中的适用性。

Result: 更新的BLUEX数据集包含2024-2025年的考试题和自动生成的图像标题，问题数量翻倍，视觉上下文的可访问性提高了40%。

Conclusion: BLUEX数据集的更新版本在语言模型评估中显示出更高的相关性和实用性，尤其在多语言和非英语环境下。

Abstract: With the growing capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is an
increasing need for robust evaluation methods, especially in multilingual and
non-English contexts. We present an updated version of the BLUEX dataset, now
including 2024-2025 exams and automatically generated image captions using
state-of-the-art models, enhancing its relevance for data contamination studies
in LLM pretraining. Captioning strategies increase accessibility to text-only
models by more than 40%, producing 1,422 usable questions, more than doubling
the number in the original BLUEX. We evaluated commercial and open-source LLMs
and their ability to leverage visual context through captions.

Motivation: 探讨LLM开发和部署中的复杂性，以及如何通过不同模型的特性解决这些问题。

Method: 通过审查16个关键挑战，并分析OpenAI的GPT-4o和DeepSeek-V3-0324这两种模型的独特方法，比较其优缺点。

Result: 展示了闭源模型在安全性和可靠性上的优势，以及开源模型在效率和适应性上的优势，并分析了不同应用场景下的最佳模型选择。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming AI across industries, but their
development and deployment remain complex. This survey reviews 16 key
challenges in building and using LLMs and examines how these challenges are
addressed by two state-of-the-art models with unique approaches: OpenAI's
closed source GPT-4o (May 2024 update) and DeepSeek-V3-0324 (March 2025), a
large open source Mixture-of-Experts model. Through this comparison, we
showcase the trade-offs between closed source models (robust safety, fine-tuned
reliability) and open source models (efficiency, adaptability). We also explore
LLM applications across different domains (from chatbots and coding tools to
healthcare and education), highlighting which model attributes are best suited
for each use case. This article aims to guide AI researchers, developers, and
decision-makers in understanding current LLM capabilities, limitations, and
best practices.

*Alexandre Kabbach*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文以统计视角重新解读图灵测试，认为测试针对普通智能而非卓越表现，并指出ChatGPT等模型因追求卓越而非普通水平难以通过测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨图灵测试的核心意义及其在现代人工智能（如ChatGPT）中的适用性，揭示普通智能与人工智慧的区别。

Method: 通过统计视角重新解读图灵测试中的“普通”概念，提出图灵测试是对普通智能的评估，并由多人陪审团的平均判断来实现。

Result: 提出图灵测试是对普通智能的统计评估，强调模型应在行为上模拟普通人类的错误和不完美，而非追求卓越表现。

Conclusion: 本文得出两个结论：一是ChatGPT等大型语言模型不太可能通过图灵测试，因为这些模型针对的是人类智能的特例而非普通水平；二是图灵测试对人类认知的理解是否有贡献，关键在于人类思维是否可以简化为普通思维，这超出了测试本身的范围。

Abstract: This paper proposes to revisit the Turing test through the concept of
normality. Its core argument is that the statistical interpretation of the
normal--understood as the average both in the normative and mathematical sense
of the term--proves useful for understanding the Turing test in at least two
ways. First, in the sense that the Turing test targets normal/average rather
than exceptional human intelligence, so that successfully passing the test
requires building machines that "make mistakes" and display imperfect behavior
just like normal/average humans. Second, in the sense that the Turing test is a
statistical test where judgments of intelligence are never carried out by a
single "average" judge (understood as non-expert) but always by a full jury. As
such, the notion of "average human interrogator" that Turing talks about in his
original paper should be understood primarily as referring to a mathematical
abstraction made of the normalized aggregate of individual judgments of
multiple judges. In short, this paper argues that the Turing test is a test of
normal intelligence as assessed by a normal judge characterizing the average
judgment of a pool of human interrogators. Its conclusions are twofold. First,
it argues that large language models such as ChatGPT are unlikely to pass the
Turing test as those models precisely target exceptional rather than
normal/average human intelligence. As such, they constitute models of what it
proposes to call artificial smartness rather than artificial intelligence per
se. Second, it argues that the core question of whether the Turing test can
contribute anything to the understanding of human cognition is that of whether
the human mind is really reducible to the normal/average mind--a question which
largely extends beyond the Turing test itself and questions the conceptual
underpinnings of the normalist paradigm it belongs to.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现自动摘要评估中存在性能报告与实际结果不一致的问题，尤其是基于LLM的评估方法存在随机性和技术依赖性，需要更可靠的评估协议。

Method: 通过在一个统一的开源框架中对六种代表性评估指标（从ROUGE到G-Eval、SEval-Ex等LLM方法）进行实验，分析了它们在SummEval数据集上的表现。

Result: 研究结果表明，与人类判断一致性最高的指标通常计算成本高且稳定性较差，同时强调了LLM评估方法的随机性和技术依赖性。

Conclusion: 论文建议采用更严格的评估协议，包括详尽文档和方法标准化，以提高自动摘要评估的可靠性。

Abstract: This paper investigates reproducibility challenges in automatic text
summarization evaluation. Based on experiments conducted across six
representative metrics ranging from classical approaches like ROUGE to recent
LLM-based methods (G-Eval, SEval-Ex), we highlight significant discrepancies
between reported performances in the literature and those observed in our
experimental setting. We introduce a unified, open-source framework, applied to
the SummEval dataset and designed to support fair and transparent comparison of
evaluation metrics. Our results reveal a structural trade-off: metrics with the
highest alignment with human judgments tend to be computationally intensive and
less stable across runs. Beyond comparative analysis, this study highlights key
concerns about relying on LLMs for evaluation, stressing their randomness,
technical dependencies, and limited reproducibility. We advocate for more
robust evaluation protocols including exhaustive documentation and
methodological standardization to ensure greater reliability in automatic
summarization assessment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在学术同行评审中应用日益广泛，但潜在偏见和系统性错误可能危及科研诚信，因此需要理解ARGs的具体能力和局限。

Method: 使用自动化反事实评估框架，孤立并测试ARGs在受控条件下检测研究逻辑缺陷的能力。

Result: 研究发现，ARGs在检测研究逻辑缺陷方面表现不显著，未能在审查中有效反映逻辑问题。

Conclusion: 尽管自动审查生成器（ARGs）在检测研究逻辑缺陷方面表现不佳，但通过构建反事实评估框架，研究者可以更好地理解和改进ARGs的能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have great potential to accelerate and support
scholarly peer review and are increasingly used as fully automatic review
generators (ARGs). However, potential biases and systematic errors may pose
significant risks to scientific integrity; understanding the specific
capabilities and limitations of state-of-the-art ARGs is essential. We focus on
a core reviewing skill that underpins high-quality peer review: detecting
faulty research logic. This involves evaluating the internal consistency
between a paper's results, interpretations, and claims. We present a fully
automated counterfactual evaluation framework that isolates and tests this
skill under controlled conditions. Testing a range of ARG approaches, we find
that, contrary to expectation, flaws in research logic have no significant
effect on their output reviews. Based on our findings, we derive three
actionable recommendations for future work and release our counterfactual
dataset and evaluation framework publicly.

Conclusion: Med-RewardBench是首个专注于评估医疗奖励模型和评判器的基准，填补了现有研究的空白，并展示了在医疗场景中对模型输出与专家判断对齐的重大挑战。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) hold significant potential in
medical applications, including disease diagnosis and clinical decision-making.
However, these tasks require highly accurate, context-sensitive, and
professionally aligned responses, making reliable reward models and judges
critical. Despite their importance, medical reward models (MRMs) and judges
remain underexplored, with no dedicated benchmarks addressing clinical
requirements. Existing benchmarks focus on general MLLM capabilities or
evaluate models as solvers, neglecting essential evaluation dimensions like
diagnostic accuracy and clinical relevance. To address this, we introduce
Med-RewardBench, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate MRMs and
judges in medical scenarios. Med-RewardBench features a multimodal dataset
spanning 13 organ systems and 8 clinical departments, with 1,026
expert-annotated cases. A rigorous three-step process ensures high-quality
evaluation data across six clinically critical dimensions. We evaluate 32
state-of-the-art MLLMs, including open-source, proprietary, and
medical-specific models, revealing substantial challenges in aligning outputs
with expert judgment. Additionally, we develop baseline models that demonstrate
substantial performance improvements through fine-tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖预定义的语义维度，忽略了更精细的概念区分，因此需要一种新框架来研究粗粒度语义维度下的子维度。

Method: 提出DCSRM模型，通过分解大语言模型中的词嵌入为多个子嵌入，识别语义子维度，并使用基于体素的编码模型将这些子维度映射到大脑激活。

Result: 识别出一组可解释的语义子维度，并且这些子维度的神经相关性与大脑激活吻合，表明其在认知和神经科学上的可信性。

Conclusion: 论文提出的DCSRM框架能够分解词嵌入为多个子嵌入，识别可解释的语义子维度，并通过神经相关证据支持其认知和神经科学的合理性。

Abstract: Understanding the core dimensions of conceptual semantics is fundamental to
uncovering how meaning is organized in language and the brain. Existing
approaches often rely on predefined semantic dimensions that offer only broad
representations, overlooking finer conceptual distinctions. This paper proposes
a novel framework to investigate the subdimensions underlying coarse-grained
semantic dimensions. Specifically, we introduce a Disentangled Continuous
Semantic Representation Model (DCSRM) that decomposes word embeddings from
large language models into multiple sub-embeddings, each encoding specific
semantic information. Using these sub-embeddings, we identify a set of
interpretable semantic subdimensions. To assess their neural plausibility, we
apply voxel-wise encoding models to map these subdimensions to brain
activation. Our work offers more fine-grained interpretable semantic
subdimensions of conceptual meaning. Further analyses reveal that semantic
dimensions are structured according to distinct principles, with polarity
emerging as a key factor driving their decomposition into subdimensions. The
neural correlates of the identified subdimensions support their cognitive and
neuroscientific plausibility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究的动机是探索LLMs意识形态倾向的稳定性和深度，以及这些倾向是否反映了其内在的一致性。

Method: 研究采用双重方法：首先，通过指令提示和激活引导测量两种开源LLMs的‘可操纵性’；其次，使用稀疏自编码器（SAEs）探测这些模型的内部机制。

Result: 研究发现，一些模型可以轻松切换自由和保守观点，而另一些则表现出抵抗或更高的拒绝率。此外，意识形态‘深度’模型具有更多且更抽象的政治特征。

Conclusion: 本论文的结论是，意识形态深度是大型语言模型（LLMs）的一个可量化特性，而可操纵性则为了解其潜在政治架构提供了重要视角。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated pronounced ideological
leanings, yet the stability and depth of these positions remain poorly
understood. Surface-level responses can often be manipulated through simple
prompt engineering, calling into question whether they reflect a coherent
underlying ideology. This paper investigates the concept of "ideological depth"
in LLMs, defined as the robustness and complexity of their internal political
representations. We employ a dual approach: first, we measure the
"steerability" of two well-known open-source LLMs using instruction prompting
and activation steering. We find that while some models can easily switch
between liberal and conservative viewpoints, others exhibit resistance or an
increased rate of refusal, suggesting a more entrenched ideological structure.
Second, we probe the internal mechanisms of these models using Sparse
Autoencoders (SAEs). Preliminary analysis reveals that models with lower
steerability possess more distinct and abstract ideological features. Our
evaluations reveal that one model can contain 7.3x more political features than
another model of similar size. This allows targeted ablation of a core
political feature in an ideologically "deep" model, leading to consistent,
logical shifts in its reasoning across related topics, whereas the same
intervention in a "shallow" model results in an increase in refusal outputs.
Our findings suggest that ideological depth is a quantifiable property of LLMs
and that steerability serves as a valuable window into their latent political
architecture.

*Xiaolong Wei,Bo Lu,Xingyu Zhang,Zhejun Zhao,Dongdong Shen,Long Xia,Dawei Yin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过两种AI驱动的奖励策略（RM和LLM-as-a-Judge）在RLAIF框架下提升小型语言模型的创造性写作能力，LLM-as-a-Judge方法表现更优且更高效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）的创造性写作能力虽强，但计算成本高。当前小型语言模型（SLM）的提升方法（如SFT、RLHF）在创新性和成本上存在不足，因此探索更高效的RLAIF框架以提升SLM的创造性。

Method: 采用了两种AI驱动的奖励策略：1) 基于多智能体拒绝采样框架训练的奖励模型（RM）；2) 基于原则指导的LLM-as-a-Judge方法，其奖励函数通过对抗训练和反思机制优化。

Result: 两种策略均显著提升了模型的创造性输出，其中LLM-as-a-Judge方法在生成质量、训练效率和减少人工标注依赖方面表现更优。自动评估方法与人类判断高度一致。

Conclusion: 本文通过两种AI驱动的奖励策略在RLAIF框架下显著提升了小型语言模型的创造性写作能力，尤其是基于原则指导的LLM-as-a-Judge方法，在生成质量、训练效率和减少人工标注依赖方面表现更优。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable creative writing
capabilities, yet their substantial computational demands hinder widespread
use. Enhancing Small Language Models (SLMs) offers a promising alternative, but
current methods like Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) struggle with novelty, and
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is costly. This paper
explores two distinct AI-driven reward strategies within a Reinforcement
Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) framework to ignite the creative writing of a
7B-parameter SLM, specifically for generating Chinese greetings. The first
strategy employs a RM trained on high-quality preference data curated by a
novel multi-agent rejection sampling framework designed for creative tasks. The
second, more novel strategy utilizes a principle-guided LLM-as-a-Judge, whose
reward function is optimized via an adversarial training scheme with a
reflection mechanism, to directly provide reward signals. Comprehensive
experiments reveal that while both approaches significantly enhance creative
output over baselines, the principle-guided LLM-as-a-Judge demonstrably yields
superior generation quality. Furthermore, it offers notable advantages in
training efficiency and reduced dependency on human-annotated data, presenting
a more scalable and effective path towards creative SLMs. Our automated
evaluation methods also exhibit strong alignment with human judgments. Our code

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种新颖的自动分类器选择方法，通过优先考虑多样性并扩展性能，有效地提升了集成模型的性能。实验证明该方法在多个数据集上表现优越。

Abstract: Psychological biases, such as confirmation bias, make individuals
particularly vulnerable to believing and spreading fake news on social media,
leading to significant consequences in domains such as public health and
politics. Machine learning-based fact-checking systems have been widely studied
to mitigate this problem. Among them, ensemble methods are particularly
effective in combining multiple classifiers to improve robustness. However,
their performance heavily depends on the diversity of the constituent
classifiers-selecting genuinely diverse models remains a key challenge,
especially when models tend to learn redundant patterns. In this work, we
propose a novel automatic classifier selection approach that prioritizes
diversity, also extended by performance. The method first computes pairwise
diversity between classifiers and applies hierarchical clustering to organize
them into groups at different levels of granularity. A HierarchySelect then
explores these hierarchical levels to select one pool of classifiers per level,
each representing a distinct intra-pool diversity. The most diverse pool is
identified and selected for ensemble construction from these. The selection
process incorporates an evaluation metric reflecting each classifiers's
performance to ensure the ensemble also generalises well. We conduct
experiments with 40 heterogeneous classifiers across six datasets from
different application domains and with varying numbers of classes. Our method
is compared against the Elbow heuristic and state-of-the-art baselines. Results
show that our approach achieves the highest accuracy on two of six datasets.

Motivation: 现有数据选择和合成方法在静态数据集上的局限性，无法适应模型能力的动态变化。

Method: 框架包含自参考诊断模块和自适应优化引擎，通过模型的损失模式、嵌入聚类动态和自对齐分数识别并优化次优样本。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，Middo平均提高7.15%的准确性，同时保持原始数据集规模。

Conclusion: 这项工作通过数据和模型的动态人机协同进化，为LLM的可持续训练建立了新范式。

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) Large Language Models (LLM) fundamentally rely
on high-quality training data. While data selection and data synthesis are two
common strategies to improve data quality, existing approaches often face
limitations in static dataset curation that fail to adapt to evolving model
capabilities. In this paper, we introduce Middo, a self-evolving Model-informed
dynamic data optimization framework that uses model-aware data selection and
context-preserving data refinement. Unlike conventional one-off
filtering/synthesis methods, our framework establishes a closed-loop
optimization system: (1) A self-referential diagnostic module proactively
identifies suboptimal samples through tri-axial model signals - loss patterns
(complexity), embedding cluster dynamics (diversity), and self-alignment scores
(quality); (2) An adaptive optimization engine then transforms suboptimal
samples into pedagogically valuable training points while preserving semantic
integrity; (3) This optimization process continuously evolves with model
capability through dynamic learning principles. Experiments on multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our \method consistently enhances the quality of
seed data and boosts LLM's performance with improving accuracy by 7.15% on
average while maintaining the original dataset scale. This work establishes a
new paradigm for sustainable LLM training through dynamic human-AI co-evolution
of data and models. Our datasets, models, and code are coming soon.

Method: 通过32名参与者（均匀分布在四种Keirsey性格类型）与GPT-4和Claude 3.5在四项协作任务（数据分析、创意写作、信息检索、写作辅助）中的交互进行评估。

Result: Rationals对GPT-4有强烈偏好（特别是目标导向任务），Idealists则更偏爱Claude 3.5（尤其是创意和分析任务），其他性格类型的偏好则与任务相关。

Conclusion: 研究表明，不同性格类型的用户对不同LLMs有明显的偏好，Rationals更偏好GPT-4，而Idealists更倾向Claude 3.5，传统评估方法可能忽略这些基于性格的差异。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly integrate into everyday
workflows, where users shape outcomes through multi-turn collaboration, a
critical question emerges: do users with different personality traits
systematically prefer certain LLMs over others? We conducted a study with 32
participants evenly distributed across four Keirsey personality types,
evaluating their interactions with GPT-4 and Claude 3.5 across four
collaborative tasks: data analysis, creative writing, information retrieval,
and writing assistance. Results revealed significant personality-driven
preferences: Rationals strongly preferred GPT-4, particularly for goal-oriented
tasks, while idealists favored Claude 3.5, especially for creative and
analytical tasks. Other personality types showed task-dependent preferences.
Sentiment analysis of qualitative feedback confirmed these patterns. Notably,
aggregate helpfulness ratings were similar across models, showing how
personality-based analysis reveals LLM differences that traditional evaluations
miss.

Abstract: We present QZhou-Embedding, a general-purpose contextual text embedding model
with exceptional text representation capabilities. Built upon the
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct foundation model, we designed a unified multi-task
framework comprising specialized data transformation and training strategies.
The data transformation scheme enables the incorporation of more diverse
textual training datasets, while the task-specific training strategies enhance
model learning efficiency. We developed a data synthesis pipeline leveraging
LLM API, incorporating techniques such as paraphrasing, augmentation, and hard
negative example generation to improve the semantic richness and sample
difficulty of the training set. Additionally, we employ a two-stage training
strategy, comprising initial retrieval-focused pretraining followed by
full-task fine-tuning, enabling the embedding model to extend its capabilities
based on robust retrieval performance. Our model achieves state-of-the-art
results on the MTEB and CMTEB benchmarks, ranking first on both leaderboards
(August 27 2025), and simultaneously achieves state-of-the-art performance on
tasks including reranking, clustering, etc. Our findings demonstrate that
higher-quality, more diverse data is crucial for advancing retrieval model
performance, and that leveraging LLMs generative capabilities can further
optimize data quality for embedding model breakthroughs. Our model weights are

Conclusion: Misviz和Misviz-synth的发布为未来研究提供了资源，但需进一步改进模型以应对这一复杂任务。

Abstract: Misleading visualizations are a potent driver of misinformation on social
media and the web. By violating chart design principles, they distort data and
lead readers to draw inaccurate conclusions. Prior work has shown that both
humans and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are frequently deceived by
such visualizations. Automatically detecting misleading visualizations and
identifying the specific design rules they violate could help protect readers
and reduce the spread of misinformation. However, the training and evaluation
of AI models has been limited by the absence of large, diverse, and openly
available datasets. In this work, we introduce Misviz, a benchmark of 2,604
real-world visualizations annotated with 12 types of misleaders. To support
model training, we also release Misviz-synth, a synthetic dataset of 81,814
visualizations generated using Matplotlib and based on real-world data tables.
We perform a comprehensive evaluation on both datasets using state-of-the-art
MLLMs, rule-based systems, and fine-tuned classifiers. Our results reveal that
the task remains highly challenging. We release Misviz, Misviz-synth, and the

Motivation: 监督微调（SFT）存在任务间的'跷跷板现象'，导致部分任务性能提升而其他任务受损。

Method: 提出CPI-FT框架，包括独立微调以识别核心参数区域、基于区域重叠的任务分组、参数融合技术和轻量级SFT训练。

Conclusion: CPI-FT框架通过核心参数隔离和融合技术，有效减轻了任务干扰和遗忘，显著优于传统多任务和分阶段微调方法。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a pivotal approach to adapting large language
models (LLMs) for downstream tasks; however, performance often suffers from the
``seesaw phenomenon'', where indiscriminate parameter updates yield progress on
certain tasks at the expense of others. To address this challenge, we propose a
novel \emph{Core Parameter Isolation Fine-Tuning} (CPI-FT) framework.
Specifically, we first independently fine-tune the LLM on each task to identify
its core parameter regions by quantifying parameter update magnitudes. Tasks
with similar core regions are then grouped based on region overlap, forming
clusters for joint modeling. We further introduce a parameter fusion technique:
for each task, core parameters from its individually fine-tuned model are
directly transplanted into a unified backbone, while non-core parameters from
different tasks are smoothly integrated via Spherical Linear Interpolation
(SLERP), mitigating destructive interference. A lightweight, pipelined SFT
training phase using mixed-task data is subsequently employed, while freezing
core regions from prior tasks to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Extensive
experiments on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate that our approach
significantly alleviates task interference and forgetting, consistently
outperforming vanilla multi-task and multi-stage fine-tuning baselines.

Result: MENTAT在基准测试中比基线方法提升了65%。

Conclusion: MENTAT方法在RiR任务中表现出色，相比基线有显著提升，但仍存在改进空间。

Abstract: AI researchers and practitioners increasingly apply large language models
(LLMs) to what we call reasoning-intensive regression (RiR), i.e. deducing
subtle numerical properties from text. Unlike standard language regression
tasks, e.g. for sentiment or similarity, RiR often appears instead in ad-hoc
problems like rubric-based scoring or domain-specific retrieval, where much
deeper analysis of text is required while only limited task-specific training
data and computation are available. We cast three realistic problems as RiR
tasks to establish an initial benchmark, and use that to test our hypothesis
that prompting frozen LLMs and finetuning Transformer encoders via gradient
descent will both often struggle in RiR. We then propose MENTAT, a simple and
lightweight method that combines batch-reflective prompt optimization with
neural ensemble learning. MENTAT achieves up to 65% improvement over both
baselines, though substantial room remains for future advances in RiR.

Conclusion: PiCSAR通过联合对数似然评分方法显著提升了模型在推理任务中的性能，且无需训练。

Abstract: Best-of-n sampling improves the accuracy of large language models (LLMs) and
large reasoning models (LRMs) by generating multiple candidate solutions and
selecting the one with the highest reward. The key challenge for reasoning
tasks is designing a scoring function that can identify correct reasoning
chains without access to ground-truth answers. We propose Probabilistic
Confidence Selection And Ranking (PiCSAR): a simple, training-free method that
scores each candidate generation using the joint log-likelihood of the
reasoning and final answer. The joint log-likelihood of the reasoning and final
answer naturally decomposes into reasoning confidence and answer confidence.
PiCSAR achieves substantial gains across diverse benchmarks (+10.18 on MATH500,
+9.81 on AIME2025), outperforming baselines with at least 2x fewer samples in
16 out of 20 comparisons. Our analysis reveals that correct reasoning chains
exhibit significantly higher reasoning and answer confidence, justifying the
effectiveness of PiCSAR.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) rely heavily on web-scale datasets like Common

However, the indiscriminate nature of web crawling raises challenges in data

Abstract: We design a dynamically-weighted state-averaged constrained CASSCF to treat

consider configurations that are mutually single excitations of each other, and
we apply a generalized set of constraints to tailor the method for studying
charge transfer problems. The constrained optimization problem is efficiently
solved using a DIIS-SQP algorithm, thus maintaining computational efficiency.
We demonstrate the method for a finite Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain,
successfully reproducing the expected exponential decay of diabatic couplings
with distance. When combined with a gradient, the current extension immediately
enables efficient nonadiabatic dynamics simulations of complex multi-state

formalism, we are able to differentiate both the CASSCF energy and the
constraint (which is required for globally smooth surfaces), and the resulting
efficient algorithm can be immediately applied to nonadiabatic dynamics
simulations of charge transfer processes. Here, we run initial surface-hopping
simulations of a proton coupled electron transfer event for a phenoxyl-phenol
system.

Motivation: 间断Galerkin方法天生适合GPU架构的数据并行性，因此探索其在GPU上的移植效果和性能表现具有重要意义。

Method: 通过CUDA Fortran和OpenACC两种方法进行移植，重点关注代码设计、编程便捷性和性能测试，OpenACC版本还注重通过统一内存保持代码维护性。

Result: 在NVIDIA Grace Hopper芯片上测试，并与144核CPU节点上的MPI版本进行比较，验证了GPU移植的性能优势和可行性。

Conclusion: GPU移植显著提升了DG-SWEM的性能，OpenACC在维护性上表现更优，为未来类似研究提供了参考。

Abstract: This paper presents a porting of DG-SWEM, a discontinuous Galerkin solver for
coastal ocean circulation, and in particular storm surge, to GPU using two
separate approaches: CUDA Fortran and OpenACC. Time-explicit discontinuous
Galerkin methods have been shown to exhibit a large amount of data parallelism
due to the loose coupling between elements, and thus are naturally mapped to
the GPU architecture. For each porting approach, we discuss the code design,
ease of programming, and performance when running on realistic use cases.
Specifically for the OpenACC version, we also aim to preserve maintainability
within the same codebase through using Unified Memory. We test the codes on
NVIDIA's Grace Hopper chip and compare the GPU performance on each node to the
MPI version on a single CPU node (144 cores).

Conclusion: 论文总结了一维随机聚合物模型的局部本征值统计（LES），并证明在临界能量处LES由均匀钟进程描述，而在其他能量处则为泊松点过程。这些结果深化了对模型的理解，特别是临界能量与非平凡输运之间的关系。

Abstract: We study the local eigenvalue statistics (LES) associated with
one-dimensional lattice models of random polymers. We consider models
constructed from two polymers. Each polymer is a finite interval of lattice
points with a finite potential. These polymers are distributed along
$\mathbb{Z}$ according to a Bernoulli distribution. The deterministic spectrum
for these models is dense pure point, and is known to contain finitely-many
critical energies. In this paper, we prove that the LES centered at these
critical energies is described by a uniform clock process, and that the LES for
the unfolded eigenvalues, centered at any other energy in the deterministic
spectrum, is a Poisson point process. These results add to our understanding of
these models that exhibit dynamical localization in any energy interval
avoiding the critical energies [Damanik, Sims, Stolz] [De Bievre, Germinet],
and nontrivial transport for wave packets with initial states supported at an
integer point [Jitomirskaya, Schultz-Baldes, Stolz]. We show that the
projection of these initial states onto spectral subspaces associated with any
energy interval that contains all of the critical energies exhibit nontrivial
transport, refining the connection between nontrivial transport and the
critical energies. Finally, we also prove that the transition in the unfolded
LES is sharp at the critical energies.

Motivation: 研究稀疏rank-1随机图上q态Potts模型中关键逆温度β_c的决定性量t_c及其相关量t_c'和t_c''的性质，以加深对模型相变行为的理解。

Result: 得到了t_c、t_c'和t_c''的简单上界，如t_c<2ln(q−1)，t_c'<3/2ln(q−1)，t_c''<ln(q−1)，并证明了这些上界在极限情况下的紧性。

Conclusion: 本研究通过分析稀疏rank-1随机图上的q态Potts模型中关键逆温度β_c的决定性量t_c及其相关量t_c'和t_c''，推导出了一系列简单而有效的上界，并在特定情况下证明了这些上界的紧性。

Abstract: We consider in this work the crucial quantity $t_c$ that determines the
critical inverse temperature $\beta_c$ in the $q$-state Potts model on sparse
rank-1 random graphs where the vertices are equipped with a Pareto weight
density $(\tau-1)\,w^{-\tau}\,{\cal X}_{[1,\infty)}(w)$. It is shown in
\cite{ref1} that this $t_c$ is the unique positive zero of a function ${\cal
K}$ that is obtained by an appropriate combination of the stationarity
condition and the criticality condition for the case the external field $B$
equals 0 and that $q\geq3$ and $\tau\geq4$, see \cite{ref1}, Theorem~1.14 and
Theorem ~1.21 and their proofs in \cite{ref1}, Section~7.1 and Section~7.3.
From the proof of \cite{ref1}, Theorem~1.14, it is seen that ${\cal K}'$ and
${\cal K}''$ also have a unique positive zero, $t_c'$ and $t_c''$,
respectively, and $t_c'=t_b$ and $t_c''=t_{\ast}$, where $t_b$ and $t_{\ast}$
are the unique positive zeros of ${\cal F}_0(t)-t\,{\cal F}_0'(t)$ and ${\cal
F}_0''(t)$, respectively. Here, ${\cal
F}_0(t)=E\,[W(e^{tW}-1)/(E\,[W]\,(e^{tW}+q-1))]$, and $t_c$, $t_b$ and
$t_{\ast}$ play a key role in the graphical analysis of \cite{ref1},
Section~5.1 and Figure~1. Furthermore, $\gamma_c=\exp(\beta_c)-1$ and $t_c$ are
related according to $\gamma_c=t_c/{\cal F}_0(t_c)$.
  We analyse $t_c$, $t_c'$ and $t_c''$ for general real $\tau\geq4$ and general
real $q>2$ by an appropriate formulation of their defining equations ${\cal
K}(t_c)={\cal K}'(t_c')={\cal K}''(t_c'')=0$. Thus we find, along with the
inequality $0<t_c''<t_c'<t_c<\infty$, the simple upper bounds $t_c<2\,{\rm
ln}(q-1)$, $t_c'<\frac32\,{\rm ln}(q-1)$, $t_c''<{\rm ln}(q-1)$, as well as
certain sharpenings of these simple bounds and counterparts about the large-$q$
behaviour of $t_c$, $t_c$ and $t_c''$. We show that these bounds are sharp in
the sense that they hold with equality for the limiting homogeneous case
$\tau\to\infty$.

Motivation: 动机在于探索自由累积量的先驱多项式，以及这些多项式在有限$N$情况下的性质和行为。研究目的是为了理解它们在矩阵积分和随机矩阵理论中的作用。

Abstract: We introduce $\mathrm{U}(N)$ invariant polynomials on the space of $N\times
N$ matrices that are precursors of free cumulants in various respects. First,
they are polynomials of deterministic matrices, that are not yet evaluated over
some probability law, contrary to what is usually meant by cumulants. Secondly,
they converge towards the algebraic expression of free cumulants in terms of
moments as $N\to \infty$, with $1/N^2$ corrections expressed in terms of
monotone Hurwitz numbers. Their most crucial property is their additivity with
respect to averaging over sums of $\mathrm{U}(N)$ conjugacy orbits, providing a
finite $N$ version of the well-known additivity of free cumulants in free
probability. Finally, they extend several properties of free cumulants at
finite $N$, including a Wick rule for their average over a Gaussian weight and
their appearance in various matrix integrals. Building on the additivity
property of these precursors, we also define and compute a coproduct describing
the behaviour of general invariant polynomials with respect to the addition of
$\mathrm{U}(N)$ conjugacy orbits, as well as their expectation values on sums
of $\mathrm{U}(N)$-invariant random matrices. In our construction, a central
role is played by the so-called HCIZ integral, both for the definition of the
precursors and for the derivation of their properties.

Abstract: We consider a system of weakly interacting spinful lattice fermions coupled
to a dynamical $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field. The ground state lies in the sector
of a uniform $\pi$-flux per plaquette and the monopoles are massive. In the
presence of a staggered mass for the fermions, this yields a fully gapped,
four-dimensional ground state space on large tori. It is topologically ordered.
By considering adiabatic $\pi$-flux insertion, we construct dressed monopole
excitations and show that their braiding with the fermionic excitations are
those of the toric code.

equivalent time- and action-dependent descriptions which result in conformally
equivalent metrics.

Abstract: Short text clustering is a known use case in the text analytics community.
When the structure and content falls in the natural language domain e.g.
Twitter posts or instant messages, then natural language techniques can be
used, provided texts are of sufficient length to allow for use of (pre)trained
models to extract meaningful information, such as part-of-speech or topic
annotations. However, natural language models are not suitable for clustering
transaction counterparties, as they are found in bank payment messaging
systems, such as SWIFT. The manually typed tags are typically physical or legal
entity details, which lack sentence structure, while containing all the
variations and noise that manual entry introduces. This leaves a gap in an
investigator or counter-fraud professional's toolset when looking to augment
their knowledge of payment flow originator and beneficiary entities and trace
funds and assets. A gap that vendors traditionally try to close with fuzzy
matching tools. With these considerations in mind, we are proposing a hybrid
string similarity, topic modelling, hierarchical clustering and rule-based
pipeline to facilitate clustering of transaction counterparties, also catering
for unknown number of expected clusters. We are also devising metrics to
supplement the evaluation of the approach, based on the well-known measures of
precision and recall. Testing on a real-life labelled dataset demonstrates
significantly improved performance over a baseline rule-based ('keyword')
approach. The approach retains most of the interpretability found in rule-based
systems, as the former adds an additional level of cluster refinement to the
latter. The resulting workflow reduces the need for manual review. When only a
subset of the population needs to be investigated, such as in sanctions
investigations, the approach allows for better control of the risks of missing
entity variations.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) marks a fundamental shift in how artificial
intelligence is applied in healthcare. Instead of merely predicting outcomes,
RL actively decides interventions with long term goals. Unlike traditional
models that operate on fixed associations, RL systems learn through trial,
feedback, and long-term reward optimization, introducing transformative
possibilities and new risks. From an information fusion lens, healthcare RL
typically integrates multi-source signals such as vitals, labs clinical notes,
imaging and device telemetry using temporal and decision-level mechanisms.
These systems can operate within centralized, federated, or edge architectures
to meet real-time clinical constraints, and naturally span data, features and
decision fusion levels. This survey explore RL's rise in healthcare as more
than a set of tools, rather a shift toward agentive intelligence in clinical
environments. We first structure the landscape of RL techniques including
model-based and model-free methods, offline and batch-constrained approaches,
and emerging strategies for reward specification and uncertainty calibration
through the lens of healthcare constraints. We then comprehensively analyze RL
applications spanning critical care, chronic disease, mental health,
diagnostics, and robotic assistance, identifying their trends, gaps, and
translational bottlenecks. In contrast to prior reviews, we critically analyze
RL's ethical, deployment, and reward design challenges, and synthesize lessons
for safe, human-aligned policy learning. This paper serves as both a a
technical roadmap and a critical reflection of RL's emerging transformative
role in healthcare AI not as prediction machinery, but as agentive clinical
intelligence.

Abstract: Recent advancements in EEG-based emotion recognition have shown promising
outcomes using both deep learning and classical machine learning approaches;
however, most existing studies focus narrowly on binary valence prediction or
subject-specific classification, which limits generalizability and deployment
in real-world affective computing systems. To address this gap, this paper
presents a unified, multigranularity EEG emotion classification framework built
on the GAMEEMO dataset, which consists of 14-channel EEG recordings and
continuous self-reported emotion ratings (boring, horrible, calm, and funny)
from 28 subjects across four emotion-inducing gameplay scenarios. Our pipeline
employs a structured preprocessing strategy that comprises temporal window
segmentation, hybrid statistical and frequency-domain feature extraction, and
z-score normalization to convert raw EEG signals into robust, discriminative
input vectors. Emotion labels are derived and encoded across three
complementary axes: (i) binary valence classification based on the averaged
polarity of positive and negative emotion ratings, and (ii) Multi-class emotion
classification, where the presence of the most affective state is predicted.
(iii) Fine-grained multi-label representation via binning each emotion into 10
ordinal classes. We evaluate a broad spectrum of models, including Random
Forest, XGBoost, and SVM, alongside deep neural architectures such as LSTM,
LSTM-GRU, and CNN-LSTM. Among these, the LSTM-GRU model consistently
outperforms the others, achieving an F1-score of 0.932 in the binary valence
task and 94.5% and 90.6% in both multi-class and Multi-Label emotion
classification.

Abstract: Auditing the privacy leakage of synthetic data is an important but unresolved
problem. Most existing privacy auditing frameworks for synthetic data rely on
heuristics and unreasonable assumptions to attack the failure modes of
generative models, exhibiting limited capability to describe and detect the
privacy exposure of training data through synthetic data release. In this
paper, we study designing Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) that specifically
exploit the observation that tabular generative models tend to significantly
overfit to certain regions of the training distribution. Here, we propose
Generative Likelihood Ratio Attack (Gen-LRA), a novel, computationally
efficient No-Box MIA that, with no assumption of model knowledge or access,
formulates its attack by evaluating the influence a test observation has in a
surrogate model's estimation of a local likelihood ratio over the synthetic
data. Assessed over a comprehensive benchmark spanning diverse datasets, model
architectures, and attack parameters, we find that Gen-LRA consistently
dominates other MIAs for generative models across multiple performance metrics.
These results underscore Gen-LRA's effectiveness as a privacy auditing tool for
the release of synthetic data, highlighting the significant privacy risks posed
by generative model overfitting in real-world applications.

Conclusion: PVPO通过优势参考锚点和数据预采样有效提升了强化学习的效率和性能。

Abstract: Critic-free reinforcement learning methods, particularly group policies, have
attracted considerable attention for their efficiency in complex tasks.
However, these methods rely heavily on multiple sampling and comparisons within
the policy to estimate advantage, which may cause the policy to fall into local
optimum and increase computational cost. To address these issues, we propose
PVPO, an efficient reinforcement learning method enhanced by an advantage
reference anchor and data pre-sampling. Specifically, we use the reference
model to rollout in advance and employ the calculated reward score as a
reference anchor. Our approach effectively corrects the cumulative bias
introduced by intra-group comparisons and significantly reduces reliance on the
number of rollouts. Meanwhile, the reference model can assess sample difficulty
during data pre-sampling, enabling effective selection of high-gain data to
improve training efficiency. Experiments conducted on nine datasets across two
domains demonstrate that PVPO achieves State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) performance. Our
approach not only demonstrates robust generalization across multiple tasks, but
also exhibits scalable performance across models of varying scales.

Abstract: Adaptive gradient methods like Adagrad and its variants are widespread in
large-scale optimization. However, their use of diagonal preconditioning
matrices limits the ability to capture parameter correlations. Full-matrix
adaptive methods, approximating the exact Hessian, can model these correlations
and may enable faster convergence. At the same time, their computational and
memory costs are often prohibitive for large-scale models. To address this
limitation, we propose AdaGram, an optimizer that enables efficient full-matrix
adaptive gradient updates. To reduce memory and computational overhead, we
utilize fast symmetric factorization for computing the preconditioned update
direction at each iteration. Additionally, we maintain the low-rank structure
of a preconditioner along the optimization trajectory using matrix integrator
methods. Numerical experiments on standard machine learning tasks show that
AdaGram converges faster or matches the performance of diagonal adaptive
optimizers when using rank five and smaller rank approximations. This
demonstrates AdaGram's potential as a scalable solution for adaptive
optimization in large models.

Result: 在高概率下，证明了过参数化两层PINNs的线性收敛性。

Conclusion: 该研究为随机训练算法在PINNs中的应用提供了理论保证。

Abstract: Physics informed neural networks (PINNs) represent a very popular class of
neural solvers for partial differential equations. In practice, one often
employs stochastic gradient descent type algorithms to train the neural
network. Therefore, the convergence guarantee of stochastic gradient descent is
of fundamental importance. In this work, we establish the linear convergence of
stochastic gradient descent / flow in training over-parameterized two layer
PINNs for a general class of activation functions in the sense of high
probability. These results extend the existing result [18] in which gradient
descent was analyzed. The challenge of the analysis lies in handling the
dynamic randomness introduced by stochastic optimization methods. The key of
the analysis lies in ensuring the positive definiteness of suitable Gram
matrices during the training. The analysis sheds insight into the dynamics of
the optimization process, and provides guarantees on the neural networks
trained by stochastic algorithms.

Abstract: This paper presents a Deep Learning (DL) framework for 48-hour forecasting of
temperature, solar irradiance, and relative humidity to support Model
Predictive Control (MPC) in smart HVAC systems. The approach employs a stacked
Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) network with attention, capturing
temporal and cross-feature dependencies by jointly predicting all three

time features were used for training, while 2023 data evaluated generalization.
The model achieved Mean Absolute Errors of 1.3 degrees Celsius (temperature),
31 W/m2 (irradiance), and 6.7 percentage points (humidity), outperforming
state-of-the-art numerical weather prediction and machine learning benchmarks.
Integrated Gradients quantified feature contributions, and attention weights
revealed temporal patterns, enhancing interpretability. By combining
multivariate forecasting, attention-based DL, and explainability, this work
advances data-driven weather prediction. The demonstrated accuracy and
transparency highlight the framework's potential for energy-efficient building
control through reliable short-term meteorological forecasting.

Conclusion: 通过整合机器学习、强化学习和大型语言模型，本研究成功构建了一个全面的异常检测系统，能够帮助JPL工程师实时识别DSN设备中的异常和退化，并通过人机反馈不断完善系统。

Abstract: The Deep Space Network (DSN) is NASA's largest network of antenna facilities
that generate a large volume of multivariate time-series data. These facilities
contain DSN antennas and transmitters that undergo degradation over long
periods of time, which may cause costly disruptions to the data flow and
threaten the earth-connection of dozens of spacecraft that rely on the Deep
Space Network for their lifeline. The purpose of this study was to experiment
with different methods that would be able to assist JPL engineers with directly
pinpointing anomalies and equipment degradation through collected data, and
continue conducting maintenance and operations of the DSN for future space
missions around our universe. As such, we have researched various machine
learning techniques that can fully reconstruct data through predictive
analysis, and determine anomalous data entries within real-time datasets
through statistical computations and thresholds. On top of the fully trained
and tested machine learning models, we have also integrated the use of a
reinforcement learning subsystem that classifies identified anomalies based on
severity level and a Large Language Model that labels an explanation for each
anomalous data entry, all of which can be improved and fine-tuned over time
through human feedback/input. Specifically, for the DSN transmitters, we have
also implemented a full data pipeline system that connects the data extraction,
parsing, and processing workflow all together as there was no coherent program
or script for performing these tasks before. Using this data pipeline system,
we were able to then also connect the models trained from DSN antenna data,
completing the data workflow for DSN anomaly detection. This was all wrapped
around and further connected by an agentic AI system, where complex reasoning
was utilized to determine the classifications and predictions of anomalous
data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中缺乏完整的查询-LLM配对知识，且查询动态变化，传统监督学习方法不适用。

Method: 开发共享嵌入空间，结合LinUCB和在线成本策略（多选择背包问题）实现自适应路由。

Result: 提出了PILOT方法，能够自适应地选择最优LLM并高效利用资源。

Conclusion: 本文提出了PILOT方法，通过上下文老虎机问题和在线成本策略，有效解决了LLM路由问题，适应动态查询和资源限制。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing,
but their varying capabilities and costs pose challenges in practical
applications. LLM routing addresses this by dynamically selecting the most
suitable LLM for each query/task. Previous approaches treat this as a
supervised learning problem, assuming complete knowledge of optimal query-LLM
pairings. However, real-world scenarios lack such comprehensive mappings and
face evolving user queries. We thus propose to study LLM routing as a
contextual bandit problem, enabling adaptive decision-making using bandit
feedback without requiring exhaustive inference across all LLMs for all queries
(in contrast to supervised routing). To address this problem, we develop a
shared embedding space for queries and LLMs, where query and LLM embeddings are
aligned to reflect their affinity. This space is initially learned from offline
human preference data and refined through online bandit feedback. We
instantiate this idea through Preference-prior Informed Linucb fOr adaptive
rouTing (PILOT), a novel extension of LinUCB. To handle diverse user budgets
for model routing, we introduce an online cost policy modeled as a multi-choice
knapsack problem, ensuring resource-efficient routing.

Conclusion: DeepResESNs通过引入层次化的残差循环层，显著提升了记忆能力和长期时间建模能力，优于传统的浅层和深层RC方法。

Abstract: Echo State Networks (ESNs) are a particular type of untrained Recurrent
Neural Networks (RNNs) within the Reservoir Computing (RC) framework, popular
for their fast and efficient learning. However, traditional ESNs often struggle
with long-term information processing. In this paper, we introduce a novel
class of deep untrained RNNs based on temporal residual connections, called
Deep Residual Echo State Networks (DeepResESNs). We show that leveraging a
hierarchy of untrained residual recurrent layers significantly boosts memory
capacity and long-term temporal modeling. For the temporal residual
connections, we consider different orthogonal configurations, including
randomly generated and fixed-structure configurations, and we study their
effect on network dynamics. A thorough mathematical analysis outlines necessary
and sufficient conditions to ensure stable dynamics within DeepResESN. Our
experiments on a variety of time series tasks showcase the advantages of the
proposed approach over traditional shallow and deep RC.

Conclusion: 该论文通过引入一种新颖的元学习框架，结合Mixture of Experts（MoE）模型，动态优化结合三种最先进的替代模型的预测结果，显著减少了预测误差，为构建更强大、稳健且准确的复合材料替代模型提供了一种有效策略。

Abstract: The computational cost associated with high-fidelity CFD simulations remains
a significant bottleneck in the automotive design and optimization cycle. While
ML-based surrogate models have emerged as a promising alternative to accelerate
aerodynamic predictions, the field is characterized by a diverse and rapidly
evolving landscape of specialized neural network architectures, with no single
model demonstrating universal superiority. This paper introduces a novel
meta-learning framework that leverages this architectural diversity as a
strength. We propose a Mixture of Experts (MoE) model that employs a dedicated
gating network to dynamically and optimally combine the predictions from three
heterogeneous, state-of-the-art surrogate models: DoMINO, a decomposable
multi-scale neural operator; X-MeshGraphNet, a scalable multi-scale graph
neural network; and FigConvNet, a factorized implicit global convolution
network. The gating network learns a spatially-variant weighting strategy,
assigning credibility to each expert based on its localized performance in
predicting surface pressure and wall shear stress fields. To prevent model
collapse and encourage balanced expert contributions, we integrate an entropy
regularization term into the training loss function. The entire system is
trained and validated on the DrivAerML dataset, a large-scale, public benchmark
of high-fidelity CFD simulations for automotive aerodynamics. Quantitative
results demonstrate that the MoE model achieves a significant reduction in L-2
prediction error, outperforming not only the ensemble average but also the most
accurate individual expert model across all evaluated physical quantities. This
work establishes the MoE framework as a powerful and effective strategy for
creating more robust and accurate composite surrogate models by synergistically
combining the complementary strengths of specialized architectures.

Conclusion: FUTURE算法通过梯度优化的方式有效地解决了树集成模型的样本遗忘问题，并在实际数据集中表现出色。

Abstract: Tree ensembles are widely recognized for their effectiveness in
classification tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse
domains, including bioinformatics, finance, and medical diagnosis. With
increasing emphasis on data privacy and the \textit{right to be forgotten},
several unlearning algorithms have been proposed to enable tree ensembles to
forget sensitive information. However, existing methods are often tailored to a
particular model or rely on the discrete tree structure, making them difficult
to generalize to complex ensembles and inefficient for large-scale datasets. To
address these limitations, we propose FUTURE, a novel unlearning algorithm for
tree ensembles. Specifically, we formulate the problem of forgetting samples as
a gradient-based optimization task. In order to accommodate
non-differentiability of tree ensembles, we adopt the probabilistic model
approximations within the optimization framework. This enables end-to-end
unlearning in an effective and efficient manner. Extensive experiments on
real-world datasets show that FUTURE yields significant and successful
unlearning performance.

Motivation: 旨在形式化解码步骤中的“流形遍历”直觉，并提供精确的实践指导，如温度的作用以及top-k和nucleus采样的数学性质。

Method: 采用变分原理和多权重更新（熵镜像更新）方法，分析离散和连续时间限制下的行为。

Result: 证明了下一个词分布收敛于softmax均衡，并阐明了温度、top-k和nucleus采样的数学性质。

Conclusion: 论文为解码过程的数学基础提供了清晰的理论框架，并提出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Decoding in large language models is often described as scoring tokens and
normalizing with softmax. We give a minimal, self-contained account of this
step as a constrained variational principle on the probability simplex. The
discrete, normalization-respecting ascent is the classical
multiplicative-weights (entropic mirror) update; its continuous-time limit is
the replicator flow. From these ingredients we prove that, for a fixed context
and temperature, the next-token distribution follows a smooth trajectory inside
the simplex and converges to the softmax equilibrium. This formalizes the
common ``manifold traversal'' intuition at the output-distribution level. The
analysis yields precise, practice-facing consequences: temperature acts as an
exact rescaling of time along the same trajectory, while top-k and nucleus
sampling restrict the flow to a face with identical guarantees. We also outline
a controlled account of path-dependent score adjustments and their connection
to loop-like, hallucination-style behavior. We make no claims about training
dynamics or internal representations; those are deferred to future work.

Abstract: Recent advances in applying reinforcement learning (RL) to large language
models (LLMs) have led to substantial progress. In particular, a series of
remarkable yet often counterintuitive phenomena have been reported in LLMs,
exhibiting patterns not typically observed in traditional RL settings. For
example, notable claims include that a single training example can match the
performance achieved with an entire dataset, that the reward signal does not
need to be very accurate, and that training solely with negative samples can
match or even surpass sophisticated reward-based methods. However, the precise
conditions under which these observations hold - and, critically, when they
fail - remain unclear. In this work, we identify a key factor that
differentiates RL observations: whether the pretrained model already exhibits
strong Model-Task Alignment, as measured by pass@k accuracy on the evaluated
task. Through a systematic and comprehensive examination of a series of
counterintuitive claims, supported by rigorous experimental validation across
different model architectures and task domains, our findings show that while
standard RL training remains consistently robust across settings, many of these
counterintuitive results arise only when the model and task already exhibit
strong model-task alignment. In contrast, these techniques fail to drive
substantial learning in more challenging regimes, where standard RL methods
remain effective.

Motivation: 旨在解决持续学习中的内存效率和任务标签依赖问题，通过生成回放方法减少对原始数据存储的需求。

Method: 提出的框架结合了SOM和VAE，在高维输入空间（如CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100）中通过VAE的潜在空间操作，而在低维输入空间（如MNIST和FashionMNIST）中则独立使用SOM。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在类增量基准测试中表现优异，优于无内存方法，并在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100上分别提升性能约10%和7%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合自组织映射（SOM）和变分自编码器（VAE），提供了一种高效且可扩展的持续学习解决方案，无需存储原始数据或任务标签。

Abstract: This work introduces a novel generative continual learning framework based on
self-organizing maps (SOMs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs) to enable
memory-efficient replay, eliminating the need to store raw data samples or task
labels. For high-dimensional input spaces, such as of CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100,
we design a scheme where the SOM operates over the latent space learned by a
VAE, whereas, for lower-dimensional inputs, such as those found in MNIST and
FashionMNIST, the SOM operates in a standalone fashion. Our method stores a
running mean, variance, and covariance for each SOM unit, from which synthetic
samples are then generated during future learning iterations. For the VAE-based
method, generated samples are then fed through the decoder to then be used in
subsequent replay. Experimental results on standard class-incremental
benchmarks show that our approach performs competitively with state-of-the-art
memory-based methods and outperforms memory-free methods, notably improving
over best state-of-the-art single class incremental performance on CIFAR-10 and
CIFAR-100 by nearly $10$\% and $7$\%, respectively. Our methodology further
facilitates easy visualization of the learning process and can also be utilized
as a generative model post-training. Results show our method's capability as a
scalable, task-label-free, and memory-efficient solution for continual
learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文介绍了Relevance Patching（RelP），一种基于Layer-wise Relevance Propagation（LRP）的梯度方法，用于替代传统的高计算成本激活修补方法，提升了效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统激活修补方法计算成本高，而现有的基于梯度的方法（如attribution patching）在深度非线性网络中噪声大且可靠性低，因此需要一种更高效且可靠的方法。

Method: 提出Relevance Patching（RelP），利用LRP的传播系数替代局部梯度，通过两次前向传播和一次后向传播实现高效计算。

Result: RelP在多模型和多任务中表现优于传统attribution patching，尤其在GPT-2 Large的IOI任务中达到更高的Pearson相关性（0.956 vs.0.006），且无需额外计算成本。

Conclusion: RelP是一种高效且准确的机制解释方法，优于现有技术，适用于深度非线性网络的局部行为分析。

Abstract: Activation patching is a standard method in mechanistic interpretability for
localizing the components of a model responsible for specific behaviors, but it
is computationally expensive to apply at scale. Attribution patching offers a
faster, gradient-based approximation, yet suffers from noise and reduced
reliability in deep, highly non-linear networks. In this work, we introduce
Relevance Patching (RelP), which replaces the local gradients in attribution
patching with propagation coefficients derived from Layer-wise Relevance
Propagation (LRP). LRP propagates the network's output backward through the
layers, redistributing relevance to lower-level components according to local
propagation rules that ensure properties such as relevance conservation or
improved signal-to-noise ratio. Like attribution patching, RelP requires only
two forward passes and one backward pass, maintaining computational efficiency
while improving faithfulness. We validate RelP across a range of models and
tasks, showing that it more accurately approximates activation patching than
standard attribution patching, particularly when analyzing residual stream and
MLP outputs in the Indirect Object Identification (IOI) task. For instance, for
MLP outputs in GPT-2 Large, attribution patching achieves a Pearson correlation
of 0.006, whereas RelP reaches 0.956, highlighting the improvement offered by
RelP. Additionally, we compare the faithfulness of sparse feature circuits
identified by RelP and Integrated Gradients (IG), showing that RelP achieves
comparable faithfulness without the extra computational cost associated with
IG.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在联邦学习中，准确评估客户端的贡献对于公平奖励和高效模型收敛至关重要，但传统Shapley值计算复杂度高，难以在大规模联邦中应用。

Method: 提出FedOwen框架，利用Owen采样近似Shapley值，并采用自适应客户端选择策略，平衡高价值客户端的利用与低采样客户端的探索。

Result: 在相同的评估成本下，FedOwen在非独立同分布基准上比现有方法最高提升23%的最终准确率。

Conclusion: FedOwen通过Owen采样高效近似Shapley值，结合自适应客户端选择策略，显著提升了联邦学习的模型准确性和收敛速度。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) aggregates information from multiple clients to train
a shared global model without exposing raw data. Accurately estimating each
client's contribution is essential not just for fair rewards, but for selecting
the most useful clients so the global model converges faster. The Shapley value
is a principled choice, yet exact computation scales exponentially with the
number of clients, making it infeasible for large federations. We propose
FedOwen, an efficient framework that uses Owen sampling to approximate Shapley
values under the same total evaluation budget as existing methods while keeping
the approximation error small. In addition, FedOwen uses an adaptive client
selection strategy that balances exploiting high-value clients with exploring
under-sampled ones, reducing bias and uncovering rare but informative data.
Under a fixed valuation cost, FedOwen achieves up to 23 percent higher final
accuracy within the same number of communication rounds compared to
state-of-the-art baselines on non-IID benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统评估过于关注最终准确率，忽视了模型从零开始学习时的累积错误成本，G&L旨在填补这一空白。

Method: G&L通过四种实验模式（Scratch/Pretrained × Online/Batch）量化模型的适应性，包括错误轨迹、选择质量和偏差。

Result: 实验表明，小模型在早期学习中错误更少，而预训练模型的优势因领域而异，所有模型均与理想性能存在差距。

Conclusion: G&L为开发早期可靠的模型提供了可重复的评估框架，补充了传统基准测试的不足。

Abstract: Evaluation of machine learning models typically emphasizes final accuracy,
overlooking the cost of adaptation: the cumulative errors incurred while
learning from scratch. Guess-and- Learn (G&L) v1.0 addresses this gap by
measuring cold-start adaptability - the total mistakes a model makes while
sequentially labeling an unlabeled dataset. At each step, the learner selects
an instance, predicts its label, receives the ground truth, and updates
parameters under either online (per-sample) or batch (delayed) mode. The
resulting error trajectory exposes adaptation speed, selection quality, and
bias - dynamics invisible to endpoint metrics.
  G&L defines four tracks (Scratch/Pretrained $\times$ Online/Batch) to
disentangle the effects of initialization and update frequency. We formalize
the protocol, relate it to classical mistake-bound theory, and estimate a
heuristic "oracle reference band" for MNIST as a plausibility reference.
Baseline experiments on MNIST and AG News, spanning classical methods
(Perceptron, k-NN), convolutional architectures (CNN, ResNet-50), and
pretrained transformers (ViT-B/16, BERT-base), reveal systematic differences in
early-phase efficiency: smaller models can adapt with fewer initial errors,
while pretraining benefits vary by domain. Across settings, current models
remain well above the oracle band, highlighting an adaptability gap.
  By quantifying the mistake cost of early learning, G&L complements
conventional benchmarks and provides a reproducible framework for developing
learners that are not only accurate in the limit but also reliable from the
first examples.

Abstract: The detection of anomalies in non-stationary time-series streams is a
critical but challenging task across numerous industrial and scientific
domains. Traditional models, trained offline, suffer significant performance
degradation when faced with concept drift, where the underlying statistical
properties of the data change over time. This paper introduces CALM
(Continuous, Adaptive, and LLM-Mediated), a novel, end-to-end framework for
real-time anomaly detection designed to address this challenge. CALM is built
on the Apache Beam distributed processing framework and leverages the TimesFm
foundation model for forecasting-based anomaly detection. The framework's
novelty lies in two core contributions. First, it implements a closed-loop,
continuous fine-tuning mechanism that allows the anomaly detection model to
adapt to evolving data patterns in near real-time. Second, it introduces an
LLM-as-a-Judge component, a Large Language Model that provides semantic,
context-aware judgments on detected anomalies to curate a high-quality training
dataset, deciding whether an anomaly represents transient noise or a meaningful
pattern shift. We evaluate CALM on the comprehensive TSB-UAD benchmark. Our
results demonstrate that the continuously fine-tuned model improves the ROC AUC
score in most datasets compared to the static, pre-trained base model,
validating the efficacy of our adaptive, LLM-guided approach to maintaining

Abstract: Detecting domain shifts in myoelectric activations poses a significant
challenge due to the inherent non-stationarity of electromyography (EMG)
signals. This paper explores the detection of domain shifts using data stream
(DS) learning techniques, focusing on the DB6 dataset from the Ninapro
database. We define domains as distinct time-series segments based on different
subjects and recording sessions, applying Kernel Principal Component Analysis
(KPCA) with a cosine kernel to pre-process and highlight these shifts. By
evaluating multiple drift detection methods such as CUSUM, Page-Hinckley, and
ADWIN, we reveal the limitations of current techniques in achieving high
performance for real-time domain shift detection in EMG signals. Our results
underscore the potential of streaming-based approaches for maintaining stable
EMG decoding models, while highlighting areas for further research to enhance
robustness and accuracy in real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: MyGO是一种基于唤醒-睡眠周期的持续学习框架，通过生成模型避免存储原始数据，显著减轻灾难性遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 持续学习中的现有方法面临数据隐私、存储限制和任务不相似时性能下降的挑战，因此提出了基于生物唤醒-睡眠周期的MyGO框架。

Method: MyGO采用两阶段方法：在“唤醒”阶段快速学习新任务并训练生成模型（G-mem）；在“睡眠”阶段通过生成的伪数据（“梦境”）通过知识蒸馏整合新旧知识。

Result: MyGO在Split-MNIST和Split-AG News基准测试中显著减轻了灾难性遗忘，并保持了高平均准确率。

Conclusion: MyGO框架通过生物启发的唤醒-睡眠周期有效地解决了持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，证明了其在隐私保护和存储效率方面的优势，并且在计算机视觉和自然语言处理任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Continual or Lifelong Learning aims to develop models capable of acquiring
new knowledge from a sequence of tasks without catastrophically forgetting what
has been learned before. Existing approaches often rely on storing samples from
previous tasks (experience replay) or employing complex regularization terms to
protect learned weights. However, these methods face challenges related to data
privacy, storage limitations, and performance degradation when tasks are
dissimilar. To address these challenges, we introduce MyGO (Memory Yielding
Generative Offline-consolidation), a novel lifelong learning framework inspired
by the biological wake-sleep cycle. During the "wake" phase, the system rapidly
learns a new task and trains a compact generative model (Generative Memory,
G-mem) to capture its data distribution. During the "sleep" phase, the system
enters an offline state, using all learned G-mem models to generate pseudo-data
("dreams") and consolidate new and old knowledge into a core feature extractor
via knowledge distillation. This approach obviates the need to store any raw
data, retaining only compact generative models, which offers significant
advantages in privacy and storage efficiency. We evaluate MyGO on computer
vision (Split-MNIST) and natural language processing (Split-AG News)
benchmarks, comparing it against a sequential fine-tuning baseline. The results
demonstrate that MyGO significantly mitigates catastrophic forgetting and
maintains high average accuracy across tasks, proving the framework's
effectiveness and domain-generality.

TL;DR: VILA是一种高效遗忘学习框架，解决了FILA的局限性，显著提升了参数效率和训练速度，并实现了优异的基准性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在生成输出时可能包含敏感信息，传统的重新训练方法计算成本高。尽管FILA提出了参数高效的遗忘学习方法，但仍存在参数访问和Fisher信息假设不充分的问题。

Method: VILA提出了一种参数识别方法，无需访问整个模型，从而减少了计算成本。该方法通过考虑Fisher信息的基本假设，提高了参数识别的准确性。

Result: VILA在参数效率和训练速度上分别比FILA高出100倍和40倍，并在TOFU、WMDP和MUSE等基准测试中达到了最新的最优性能。

Conclusion: VILA是一种新型的遗忘学习框架，通过明确考虑FILA忽略的假设，显著提高了参数识别的准确性，并大幅降低了计算成本。在多个基准测试中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated remarkable performance across various tasks but face
challenges related to unintentionally generating outputs containing sensitive
information. A straightforward approach to address this issue is to retrain the
model after excluding the problematic data. However, this approach incurs
prohibitively high computational costs. To overcome this limitation, machine
unlearning has emerged as a promising solution that can effectively remove
sensitive information without the need to retrain the model from scratch.
Recently, FILA has been proposed as a parameter-efficient unlearning method by
integrating LoRA adapters. Specifically, it calculates the Fisher information
to identify parameters associated with the forget set and assigns them to LoRA
adapters for updates. Despite its innovative approach, FILA still requires
access to all model parameters and does not adequately account for fundamental
assumptions underlying Fisher information, leading to inaccuracies in
importance estimation. To address these limitations, we propose VILA, a novel
unlearning framework that explicitly considers the assumptions overlooked in
FILA, thereby enhancing the accuracy of parameter identification for the forget
set. Moreover, VILA significantly reduces computational costs by enabling
parameter identification without accessing the entire model. Our method
achieves up to 100x higher parameter efficiency and 40x faster training speed
compared to FILA, and sets new state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks
including TOFU, WMDP, and MUSE. Our code is available at
https://github.com/kyj93790/VILA.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种分析基于代理状态的Q学习算法收敛性的框架，证明其在正则化MDP下收敛，并通过实验验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究实践中常用的Q学习算法的收敛性，特别是针对那些使用非信念状态的代理状态和策略正则化的算法。

Method: 提出了一个框架，分析了基于代理状态的Q学习算法（RASQL）及其变体，研究了其在正则化MDP下的收敛性。

Result: RASQL及其变体在温和条件下收敛到正则化MDP的固定点，且数值实验支持理论结论。

Conclusion: 论文证明了RASQL在温和的技术条件下收敛到一个适当定义的正则化MDP的固定点，并通过数值实验验证了理论结果的正确性。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a framework to understand the convergence of
commonly used Q-learning reinforcement learning algorithms in practice. Two
salient features of such algorithms are: (i)~the Q-table is recursively updated
using an agent state (such as the state of a recurrent neural network) which is
not a belief state or an information state and (ii)~policy regularization is
often used to encourage exploration and stabilize the learning algorithm. We
investigate the simplest form of such Q-learning algorithms which we call
regularized agent-state-based Q-learning (RASQL) and show that it converges
under mild technical conditions to the fixed point of an appropriately defined
regularized MDP, which depends on the stationary distribution induced by the
behavioral policy. We also show that a similar analysis continues to work for a
variant of RASQL that learns periodic policies. We present numerical examples
to illustrate that the empirical convergence behavior matches with the proposed
theoretical limit.

TL;DR: Sampled-SAE 改进稀疏自编码器，通过灵活特征选择权衡全局一致性和细粒度重建，实验显示参数选择依赖于具体目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决 TopK SAE 在处理信息量不均的标记时的低效问题，以及 BatchTopK 可能导致的“激活彩票”问题，Sampled-SAE 被设计为一种更灵活的替代方案。

Method: Sampled-SAE 通过评分批处理激活矩阵的列（使用 L2 范数或熵），构建特征候选池，并通过 Top-K 从受限池中选择特征。该方法允许在不同级别上进行特征选择。

Result: 在 Pythia-160M 上的实验表明，Sampled-SAE 可以根据不同需求调整参数，实现了在共享结构、重建保真度和下游性能之间的灵活权衡。

Conclusion: Sampled-SAE 提出了一种灵活的方法，通过在批处理级别和标记特定选择之间进行权衡，优化稀疏自编码器的性能。实验表明，最优参数取决于具体的应用目标和权衡。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) decompose neural activations into interpretable
features. A widely adopted variant, the TopK SAE, reconstructs each token from
its K most active latents. However, this approach is inefficient, as some
tokens carry more information than others. BatchTopK addresses this limitation
by selecting top activations across a batch of tokens. This improves average
reconstruction but risks an "activation lottery," where rare high-magnitude
features crowd out more informative but lower-magnitude ones. To address this
issue, we introduce Sampled-SAE: we score the columns (representing features)
of the batch activation matrix (via $L_2$ norm or entropy), forming a candidate
pool of size $Kl$, and then apply Top-$K$ to select tokens across the batch
from the restricted pool of features. Varying $l$ traces a spectrum between
batch-level and token-specific selection. At $l=1$, tokens draw only from $K$
globally influential features, while larger $l$ expands the pool toward
standard BatchTopK and more token-specific features across the batch. Small $l$
thus enforces global consistency; large $l$ favors fine-grained reconstruction.
On Pythia-160M, no single value optimizes $l$ across all metrics: the best
choice depends on the trade-off between shared structure, reconstruction
fidelity, and downstream performance. Sampled-SAE thus reframes BatchTopK as a
tunable, distribution-aware family.

Motivation: 长期时间序列的生成由于复杂的长期依赖性和数据分布变化而具有挑战性。

Method: 提出Stage-Diff，通过分阶段序列生成和阶段间信息传递，结合通道独立和多通道融合建模。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上的实验验证了Stage-Diff的有效性。

Conclusion: Stage-Diff在长期时间序列生成任务中展现了良好的性能。

Abstract: Generative models have been successfully used in the field of time series
generation. However, when dealing with long-term time series, which span over
extended periods and exhibit more complex long-term temporal patterns, the task
of generation becomes significantly more challenging. Long-term time series
exhibit long-range temporal dependencies, but their data distribution also
undergoes gradual changes over time. Finding a balance between these long-term
dependencies and the drift in data distribution is a key challenge. On the
other hand, long-term time series contain more complex interrelationships
between different feature sequences, making the task of effectively capturing
both intra-sequence and inter-sequence dependencies another important
challenge. To address these issues, we propose Stage-Diff, a staged generative
model for long-term time series based on diffusion models. First, through
stage-wise sequence generation and inter-stage information transfer, the model
preserves long-term sequence dependencies while enabling the modeling of data
distribution shifts. Second, within each stage, progressive sequence
decomposition is applied to perform channel-independent modeling at different
time scales, while inter-stage information transfer utilizes multi-channel
fusion modeling. This approach combines the robustness of channel-independent
modeling with the information fusion advantages of multi-channel modeling,
effectively balancing the intra-sequence and inter-sequence dependencies of
long-term time series. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets
validate the effectiveness of Stage-Diff in long-term time series generation
tasks.

Conclusion: DLGAN通过双层生成对抗网络的设计，有效解决了时间序列合成中的时序依赖性和特征捕获问题，具有显著优势。

Abstract: Time series synthesis is an effective approach to ensuring the secure
circulation of time series data. Existing time series synthesis methods
typically perform temporal modeling based on random sequences to generate
target sequences, which often struggle to ensure the temporal dependencies in
the generated time series. Additionally, directly modeling temporal features on
random sequences makes it challenging to accurately capture the feature
information of the original time series. To address the above issues, we
propose a simple but effective generative model \textbf{D}ual-\textbf{L}ayer
\textbf{G}enerative \textbf{A}dversarial \textbf{N}etworks, named
\textbf{DLGAN}. The model decomposes the time series generation process into
two stages: sequence feature extraction and sequence reconstruction. First,
these two stages form a complete time series autoencoder, enabling supervised
learning on the original time series to ensure that the reconstruction process
can restore the temporal dependencies of the sequence. Second, a Generative
Adversarial Network (GAN) is used to generate synthetic feature vectors that
align with the real-time sequence feature vectors, ensuring that the generator
can capture the temporal features from real time series. Extensive experiments
on four public datasets demonstrate the superiority of this model across
various evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: AHTSGD通过动态调整注入噪声的分布，成功提升了模型的泛化能力和训练效率，尤其在噪声数据集上表现优异。

Abstract: In the era of large-scale neural network models, optimization algorithms
often struggle with generalization due to an overreliance on training loss. One
key insight widely accepted in the machine learning community is the idea that
wide basins (regions around a local minimum where the loss increases gradually)
promote better generalization by offering greater stability to small changes in
input data or model parameters. In contrast, sharp minima are typically more
sensitive and less stable. Motivated by two key empirical observations - the
inherent heavy-tailed distribution of gradient noise in stochastic gradient
descent and the Edge of Stability phenomenon during neural network training, in
which curvature grows before settling at a plateau, we introduce Adaptive Heavy
Tailed Stochastic Gradient Descent (AHTSGD). The algorithm injects
heavier-tailed noise into the optimizer during the early stages of training to
enhance exploration and gradually transitions to lighter-tailed noise as
sharpness stabilizes. By dynamically adapting to the sharpness of the loss
landscape throughout training, AHTSGD promotes accelerated convergence to wide
basins. AHTSGD is the first algorithm to adjust the nature of injected noise
into an optimizer based on the Edge of Stability phenomenon. AHTSGD
consistently outperforms SGD and other noise-based methods on benchmarks like
MNIST and CIFAR-10, with marked gains on noisy datasets such as SVHN. It
ultimately accelerates early training from poor initializations and improves
generalization across clean and noisy settings, remaining robust to learning
rate choices.

Result: 发现策略分布经常呈现非平滑轨迹，包括早期发现但随后丢弃的正确解、与最终输出相关性低的移动排名，以及直到网络后期才出现的高策略分歧。

Conclusion: 神经网络在表示构建过程中表现出非平滑的复杂性，与语言模型中观察到的平滑收敛形成鲜明对比。

Abstract: Do neural networks build their representations through smooth, gradual
refinement, or via more complex computational processes? We investigate this by
extending the logit lens to analyze the policy network of Leela Chess Zero, a
superhuman chess engine. We find strong monotonic trends in playing strength
and puzzle-solving ability across layers, yet policy distributions frequently
follow non-smooth trajectories. Evidence for this includes correct puzzle
solutions that are discovered early but subsequently discarded, move rankings
that remain poorly correlated with final outputs, and high policy divergence
until late in the network. These findings contrast with the smooth
distributional convergence typically observed in language models.

class and remains valid even when the mixture components come from different
distribution families. As an application, we develop MV-PMODE, which scales a
previously theoretical approach to high-dimensional density estimation to
settings with thousands of dimensions. Despite its simplicity, it performs
competitively against deep baselines on CIFAR-10 anomaly detection.

Abstract: Using data from mobile network utilization in Norway, we showcase the
possibility of monitoring the state of communication and mobility networks with
a non-invasive, low-cost method. This method transforms the network data into a
model within the framework of reservoir computing and then measures the model's
performance on proxy tasks. Experimentally, we show how the performance on
these proxies relates to the state of the network. A key advantage of this
approach is that it uses readily available data sets and leverages the
reservoir computing framework for an inexpensive and largely agnostic method.
Data from mobile network utilization is available in an anonymous, aggregated
form with multiple snapshots per day. This data can be treated like a weighted
network. Reservoir computing allows the use of weighted, but untrained networks
as a machine learning tool. The network, initialized as a so-called echo state
network (ESN), projects incoming signals into a higher dimensional space, on
which a single trained layer operates. This consumes less energy than deep
neural networks in which every weight of the network is trained. We use
neuroscience inspired tasks and trained our ESN model to solve them. We then
show how the performance depends on certain network configurations and also how
it visibly decreases when perturbing the network. While this work serves as
proof of concept, we believe it can be elevated to be used for near-real-time
monitoring as well as the identification of possible weak spots of both mobile
communication networks as well as transportation networks.

Result: 在标准基准测试中，CoM表现优异，达到了最优性能。

Conclusion: CoM通过有效缓解协变量偏移，提供了一种高效且稳健的模型合并方案。

Abstract: Fine-tuning pretrained models has become a standard pathway to achieve
state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of domains, leading to a
proliferation of task-specific model variants. As the number of such
specialized modules in-creases, merging them into a unified model without
retraining has become a critical challenge. Existing merging techniques often
rely on interference heuristics,importance weighting, or activation matching
while treating each layer independently, thereby failing to account for the
inter-layer dependencies inherent in deep networks. This simplification leads
to distributional mismatches, especially inactivation-based methods, when
changes in early layers are not properly reflected in downstream ones. We
identify these mismatches as a form of internal covariate shift, comparable to
the phenomenon encountered in the initial phases of neural networks training.
To address it, we propose Chain of Merges (CoM), a layer-wise merging procedure
that updates activation statistics in an auto-regressive fashion, explicitly
accounting for cross-layer interactions. CoM produces a coherent merged model
through a series of conditionally optimal updates, effectively mitigating
degradation caused by covariate shift. Experiments on standard bench-marks
demonstrate that CoM achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: The development of continuous biomanufacturing processes requires robust and
early anomaly detection, since even minor deviations can compromise yield and
stability, leading to disruptions in scheduling, reduced weekly production, and
diminished economic performance. These processes are inherently complex and
exhibit non-linear dynamics with intricate relationships between process
variables, thus making advanced methods for anomaly detection essential for
efficient operation. In this work, we present a novel framework for
unsupervised anomaly detection in continuous biomanufacturing based on an
ensemble of generative adversarial networks (GANs). We first establish a
benchmark dataset simulating both normal and anomalous operation regimes in a
continuous process for the production of a small molecule. We then demonstrate
the effectiveness of our GAN-based framework in detecting anomalies caused by
sudden feedstock variability. Finally, we evaluate the impact of using a hybrid
quantum/classical GAN approach with both a simulated quantum circuit and a real
photonic quantum processor on anomaly detection performance. We find that the
hybrid approach yields improved anomaly detection rates. Our work shows the
potential of hybrid quantum/classical approaches for solving real-world
problems in complex continuous biomanufacturing processes.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms typically optimize the expected
cumulative reward, i.e., the expected value of the sum of scalar rewards an
agent receives over the course of a trajectory. The expected value averages the
performance over an infinite number of trajectories. However, when deploying
the agent in the real world, this ensemble average may be uninformative for the
performance of individual trajectories. Thus, in many applications, optimizing
the long-term performance of individual trajectories might be more desirable.
In this work, we propose a novel RL algorithm that combines the standard
ensemble average with the time-average growth rate, a measure for the long-term
performance of individual trajectories. We first define the Bellman operator
for the time-average growth rate. We then show that, under multiplicative
reward dynamics, the geometric mean aligns with the time-average growth rate.
To address more general and unknown reward dynamics, we propose a modified
geometric mean with $N$-sliding window that captures the path-dependency as an
estimator for the time-average growth rate. This estimator is embedded as a
regularizer into the objective, forming a practical algorithm and enabling the
policy to benefit from ensemble average and time-average simultaneously. We
evaluate our algorithm in challenging simulations, where it outperforms
conventional RL methods.

Abstract: In recent years, with the large-scale expansion of graph data, there has been
an increased focus on Riemannian manifold data spaces other than Euclidean
space. In particular, the development of hyperbolic spaces has been remarkable,
and they have high expressive power for graph data with hierarchical
structures. Normalized Maximum Likelihood (NML) is employed in regret
minimization and model selection. However, existing formulations of NML have
been developed primarily in Euclidean spaces and are inherently dependent on
the choice of coordinate systems, making it non-trivial to extend NML to
Riemannian manifolds. In this study, we define a new NML that reflects the
geometric structure of Riemannian manifolds, called the Riemannian manifold NML
(Rm-NML). This Rm-NML is invariant under coordinate transformations and
coincides with the conventional NML under the natural parameterization in
Euclidean space. We extend existing computational techniques for NML to the
setting of Riemannian manifolds. Furthermore, we derive a method to simplify
the computation of Rm-NML on Riemannian symmetric spaces, which encompass data
spaces of growing interest such as hyperbolic spaces. To illustrate the
practical application of our proposed method, we explicitly computed the Rm-NML
for normal distributions on hyperbolic spaces.

Abstract: Recent advances in Structure-based Drug Design (SBDD) have leveraged
generative models for 3D molecular generation, predominantly evaluating model
performance by binding affinity to target proteins. However, practical drug
discovery necessitates high binding affinity along with synthetic feasibility
and selectivity, critical properties that were largely neglected in previous
evaluations. To address this gap, we identify fundamental limitations of
conventional diffusion-based generative models in effectively guiding molecule
generation toward these diverse pharmacological properties. We propose CByG, a
novel framework extending Bayesian Flow Network into a gradient-based
conditional generative model that robustly integrates property-specific
guidance. Additionally, we introduce a comprehensive evaluation scheme
incorporating practical benchmarks for binding affinity, synthetic feasibility,
and selectivity, overcoming the limitations of conventional evaluation methods.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed CByG framework
significantly outperforms baseline models across multiple essential evaluation
criteria, highlighting its effectiveness and practicality for real-world drug
discovery applications.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification in reinforcement learning can greatly improve
exploration and robustness. Approximate Bayesian approaches have recently been
popularized to quantify uncertainty in model-free algorithms. However, so far
the focus has been on improving the accuracy of the posterior approximation,
instead of studying the accuracy of the prior and likelihood assumptions
underlying the posterior. In this work, we demonstrate that there is a cold
posterior effect in Bayesian deep Q-learning, where contrary to theory,
performance increases when reducing the temperature of the posterior. To
identify and overcome likely causes, we challenge common assumptions made on
the likelihood and priors in Bayesian model-free algorithms. We empirically
study prior distributions and show through statistical tests that the common
Gaussian likelihood assumption is frequently violated. We argue that developing
more suitable likelihoods and priors should be a key focus in future Bayesian
reinforcement learning research and we offer simple, implementable solutions
for better priors in deep Q-learning that lead to more performant Bayesian
algorithms.

Motivation: 针对早期退出模型的现有校准方法可能导致计算浪费且不保留样本排名，研究者希望找到更有效的性能评估指标。

Method: 研究通过实验验证了校准方法的局限性，并提出了使用失败预测作为更可靠的早期退出模型评估指标。

Conclusion: 本文提出，失败预测比校准方法更适合作为早期退出模型性能的代理，因为它能够更好地反映样本排名的变化，并与效率提升密切相关。

Abstract: Early-exit models speed up inference by attaching internal classifiers to
intermediate layers of the model and allowing computation to stop once a
prediction satisfies an exit criterion. Most early-exit methods rely on
confidence-based exit strategies, which motivated some works to calibrate
intermediate classifiers to improve the performance of the entire model. In
this paper, we show that calibration measures can be misleading indicators of
the performance of multi-exit models: a well-calibrated classifier may still
waste computation, and common calibration methods do not preserve the sample
ranking within a classifier. We demonstrate empirical cases where miscalibrated
networks outperform calibrated ones. As an alternative, we propose to use
failure prediction as a more useful proxy for early-exit model performance.
Unlike calibration, failure prediction accounts for changes in the ranking of
samples and shows a strong correlation with efficiency improvements, making it
a more dependable basis for designing and evaluating early-exit models.

Motivation: 解决基于Transformer的强化学习代理在能源受限的边缘平台上效率不足的问题，同时利用脉冲神经网络的超低功耗特性。

Method: 通过在每个自注意力块中嵌入Leaky Integrate-and-Fire神经元，并使用替代梯度进行端到端训练，同时结合了生物启发的三因素可塑性、相移尖峰位置编码和轻量级树突路由模块。

Result: 在经典控制基准测试中表现优于或与标准Decision Transformer相当，且每个决策仅产生少于十个尖峰信号，能源消耗降低了四个数量级。

Conclusion: SNN-DT成功将序列建模与神经形态效率结合，为嵌入式设备和可穿戴设备提供了实时、低功耗的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning agents based on Transformer architectures have
achieved impressive performance on sequential decision-making tasks, but their
reliance on dense matrix operations makes them ill-suited for
energy-constrained, edge-oriented platforms. Spiking neural networks promise
ultra-low-power, event-driven inference, yet no prior work has seamlessly
merged spiking dynamics with return-conditioned sequence modeling. We present
the Spiking Decision Transformer (SNN-DT), which embeds Leaky
Integrate-and-Fire neurons into each self-attention block, trains end-to-end
via surrogate gradients, and incorporates biologically inspired three-factor
plasticity, phase-shifted spike-based positional encodings, and a lightweight
dendritic routing module. Our implementation matches or exceeds standard
Decision Transformer performance on classic control benchmarks (CartPole-v1,
MountainCar-v0, Acrobot-v1, Pendulum-v1) while emitting fewer than ten spikes
per decision, an energy proxy suggesting over four orders-of-magnitude
reduction in per inference energy. By marrying sequence modeling with
neuromorphic efficiency, SNN-DT opens a pathway toward real-time, low-power
control on embedded and wearable devices.

Motivation: 随着LLMs在高风险决策任务（如贷款审批）中的应用增加，其处理表格数据、确保公平性和提供可靠预测的能力面临挑战。

Method: 评估了LLMs在零样本学习和上下文学习（ICL）能力下的表现和公平性，重点关注不同序列化格式（如GReat和LIFT）的影响。

Result: 结果表明，序列化格式的选择显著影响LLMs的性能和公平性，ICL虽然提升了4.9-59.6%的性能，但对公平性的影响因数据集而异。

Conclusion: 本研究强调了有效的表格数据表示方法和公平性感知模型的重要性，以提高大语言模型（LLMs）在金融决策中的可靠性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in high-stakes
decision-making tasks, such as loan approvals. While their applications expand
across domains, LLMs struggle to process tabular data, ensuring fairness and
delivering reliable predictions. In this work, we assess the performance and
fairness of LLMs on serialized loan approval datasets from three geographically
distinct regions: Ghana, Germany, and the United States. Our evaluation focuses
on the model's zero-shot and in-context learning (ICL) capabilities. Our
results reveal that the choice of serialization (Serialization refers to the
process of converting tabular data into text formats suitable for processing by
LLMs.) format significantly affects both performance and fairness in LLMs, with
certain formats such as GReat and LIFT yielding higher F1 scores but
exacerbating fairness disparities. Notably, while ICL improved model
performance by 4.9-59.6% relative to zero-shot baselines, its effect on
fairness varied considerably across datasets. Our work underscores the
importance of effective tabular data representation methods and fairness-aware
models to improve the reliability of LLMs in financial decision-making.

Abstract: Recent studies show the promise of large language models (LLMs) for few-shot
tabular classification but highlight challenges due to the variability in
structured data. To address this, we propose distilling data into actionable
insights to enable robust and effective classification by LLMs. Drawing
inspiration from human learning processes, we introduce InsightTab, an insight
distillation framework guided by principles of divide-and-conquer, easy-first,
and reflective learning. Our approach integrates rule summarization, strategic
exemplification, and insight reflection through deep collaboration between LLMs
and data modeling techniques. The obtained insights enable LLMs to better align
their general knowledge and capabilities with the particular requirements of
specific tabular tasks. We extensively evaluate InsightTab on nine datasets.
The results demonstrate consistent improvement over state-of-the-art methods.
Ablation studies further validate the principle-guided distillation process,
while analyses emphasize InsightTab's effectiveness in leveraging labeled data
and managing bias.

Conclusion: 本文通过图曲率的视角解释了GNN在处理复杂SAT问题时的性能下降，并提出了未来工作的方向。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently shown promise as solvers for
Boolean Satisfiability Problems (SATs) by operating on graph representations of
logical formulas. However, their performance degrades sharply on harder
instances, raising the question of whether this reflects fundamental
architectural limitations. In this work, we provide a geometric explanation
through the lens of graph Ricci Curvature (RC), which quantifies local
connectivity bottlenecks. We prove that bipartite graphs derived from random
k-SAT formulas are inherently negatively curved, and that this curvature
decreases with instance difficulty. Building on this, we show that GNN-based
SAT solvers are affected by oversquashing, a phenomenon where long-range
dependencies become impossible to compress into fixed-length representations.
We validate our claims empirically across different SAT benchmarks and confirm
that curvature is both a strong indicator of problem complexity and can be used
to predict performance. Finally, we connect our findings to design principles
of existing solvers and outline promising directions for future work.

Conclusion: 虽然数据最小化在技术上可行，但其实际实施仍具有挑战性，且由于技术和用户背景的依赖性，难以制定通用的数据‘必要性’标准。

Abstract: Data minimization is a legal principle requiring personal data processing to
be limited to what is necessary for a specified purpose. Operationalizing this
principle for recommender systems, which rely on extensive personal data,
remains a significant challenge. This paper conducts a feasibility study on
minimizing implicit feedback inference data for such systems. We propose a
novel problem formulation, analyze various minimization techniques, and
investigate key factors influencing their effectiveness. We demonstrate that
substantial inference data reduction is technically feasible without
significant performance loss. However, its practicality is critically
determined by two factors: the technical setting (e.g., performance targets,
choice of model) and user characteristics (e.g., history size, preference
complexity). Thus, while we establish its technical feasibility, we conclude
that data minimization remains practically challenging and its dependence on
the technical and user context makes a universal standard for data `necessity'
difficult to implement.

Abstract: We introduce a novel wearable textile-garment featuring an innovative
electrode placement aimed at minimizing noise and motion artifacts, thereby
enhancing signal fidelity in Electrocardiography (ECG) recordings. We present a
comprehensive, sex-balanced evaluation involving 15 healthy males and 15
healthy female participants to ensure the device's suitability across
anatomical and physiological variations. The assessment framework encompasses
distinct evaluation approaches: quantitative signal quality indices to
objectively benchmark device performance; rhythm-based analyzes of
physiological parameters such as heart rate and heart rate variability; machine
learning classification tasks to assess application-relevant predictive
utility; morphological analysis of ECG features including amplitude and
interval parameters; and investigations of the effects of electrode projection
angle given by the textile / body shape, with all analyzes stratified by sex to
elucidate sex-specific influences. Evaluations were conducted across various
activity phases representing real-world conditions. The results demonstrate
that the textile system achieves signal quality highly concordant with
reference devices in both rhythm and morphological analyses, exhibits robust
classification performance, and enables identification of key sex-specific
determinants affecting signal acquisition. These findings underscore the
practical viability of textile-based ECG garments for physiological monitoring
as well as psychophysiological state detection. Moreover, we identify the
importance of incorporating sex-specific design considerations to ensure
equitable and reliable cardiac diagnostics in wearable health technologies.

Motivation: The need to address data scarcity and physical consistency challenges in conventional data-driven smart grid models.

Method: PINNs integrate physical laws into neural networks as loss functions, enforcing power balance, operational constraints, and grid stability. Performance is evaluated against XGBoost, Random Forest, and Linear Regression through interpolation, cross-validation, and episodic trajectory prediction experiments.

Result: PINNs outperform traditional models in error reduction and reliably capture state transitions in dynamic grid operations while maintaining physical feasibility, even though they slightly degrade in extreme regimes.

Conclusion: PINNs demonstrate superior generalization and physical consistency compared to traditional data-driven models, making them a promising tool for smart grid modeling and real-time control.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) present a transformative approach
for smart grid modeling by integrating physical laws directly into learning
frameworks, addressing critical challenges of data scarcity and physical
consistency in conventional data-driven methods. This paper evaluates PINNs'
capabilities as surrogate models for smart grid dynamics, comparing their
performance against XGBoost, Random Forest, and Linear Regression across three
key experiments: interpolation, cross-validation, and episodic trajectory
prediction. By training PINNs exclusively through physics-based loss functions
(enforcing power balance, operational constraints, and grid stability) we
demonstrate their superior generalization, outperforming data-driven models in
error reduction. Notably, PINNs maintain comparatively lower MAE in dynamic
grid operations, reliably capturing state transitions in both random and
expert-driven control scenarios, while traditional models exhibit erratic
performance. Despite slight degradation in extreme operational regimes, PINNs
consistently enforce physical feasibility, proving vital for safety-critical
applications. Our results contribute to establishing PINNs as a
paradigm-shifting tool for smart grid surrogation, bridging data-driven
flexibility with first-principles rigor. This work advances real-time grid
control and scalable digital twins, emphasizing the necessity of physics-aware
architectures in mission-critical energy systems.

Abstract: Ocean salinity plays a vital role in circulation, climate, and marine

Abstract: Decision theories offer principled methods for making choices under various
types of uncertainty. Algorithms that implement these theories have been
successfully applied to a wide range of real-world problems, including
materials and drug discovery. Indeed, they are desirable since they can
adaptively gather information to make better decisions in the future, resulting
in data-efficient workflows. In scientific discovery, where experiments are
costly, these algorithms can thus significantly reduce the cost of
experimentation. Theoretical analyses of these algorithms are crucial for
understanding their behavior and providing valuable insights for developing
next-generation algorithms. However, theoretical analyses in the literature are
often inaccessible to non-experts. This monograph aims to provide an
accessible, self-contained introduction to the theoretical analysis of commonly
used probabilistic decision-making algorithms, including bandit algorithms,
Bayesian optimization, and tree search algorithms. Only basic knowledge of
probability theory and statistics, along with some elementary knowledge about
Gaussian processes, is assumed.

Result: 模型在点赞预测上表现优异（R²=0.98），但在评论预测上表现较差（R²=0.41），表明评论受其他未包含的因素影响较大。

Conclusion: 研究表明，情感和时间元数据结合现有观看次数可以有效预测未来的社交媒体参与度，其中点赞的预测效果优于评论。

Abstract: We present a machine learning approach for predicting social media engagement
(comments and likes) from emotional and temporal features. The dataset contains
600 songs with annotations for valence, arousal, and related sentiment metrics.
A multi target regression model based on HistGradientBoostingRegressor is
trained on log transformed engagement ratios to address skewed targets.
Performance is evaluated with both a custom order of magnitude accuracy and
standard regression metrics, including the coefficient of determination (R^2).
Results show that emotional and temporal metadata, together with existing view
counts, predict future engagement effectively. The model attains R^2 = 0.98 for
likes but only R^2 = 0.41 for comments. This gap indicates that likes are
largely driven by readily captured affective and exposure signals, whereas
comments depend on additional factors not represented in the current feature
set.

Motivation: 为了提高深度模型在真实应用中的可靠性，需要有效区分训练分布内（ID）和分布外（OOD）的样本。

Method: 利用分类头权重矩阵的奇异值分解，将模型激活分解为决定性成分和不显著成分，并分别用于检测Far-OOD和Near-OOD数据。

Result: ActSub在Far-OOD和Near-OOD情况下均表现出色，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ActSub方法通过结合显著和不显著子空间的分析，在不同分布偏移情况下均表现出色，并在多个标准OOD基准测试中达到最优结果。

Abstract: To ensure the reliability of deep models in real-world applications,
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods aim to distinguish samples close to
the training distribution (in-distribution, ID) from those farther away (OOD).
In this work, we propose a novel OOD detection method that utilizes singular
value decomposition of the weight matrix of the classification head to
decompose the model's activations into decisive and insignificant components,
which contribute maximally, respectively minimally, to the final classifier
output. We find that the subspace of insignificant components more effectively
distinguishes ID from OOD data than raw activations in regimes of large
distribution shifts (Far-OOD). This occurs because the classification objective
leaves the insignificant subspace largely unaffected, yielding features that
are ''untainted'' by the target classification task. Conversely, in regimes of
smaller distribution shifts (Near-OOD), we find that activation shaping methods
profit from only considering the decisive subspace, as the insignificant
component can cause interference in the activation space. By combining two
findings into a single approach, termed ActSub, we achieve state-of-the-art
results in various standard OOD benchmarks.

Conclusion: 该研究通过改进的纵向回归不连续性设计（LRDD）框架，成功预测了COVID-19事件对美国各县焦虑水平的影响，展示了动态和静态变量结合的重要性，并为未来类似事件的社区特异性心理健康影响提供了新的预测可能性。

Abstract: Estimating community-specific mental health effects of local events is vital
for public health policy. While forecasting mental health scores alone offers
limited insights into the impact of events on community well-being,
quasi-experimental designs like the Longitudinal Regression Discontinuity
Design (LRDD) from econometrics help researchers derive more effects that are
more likely to be causal from observational data. LRDDs aim to extrapolate the
size of changes in an outcome (e.g. a discontinuity in running scores for
anxiety) due to a time-specific event. Here, we propose adapting LRDDs beyond
traditional forecasting into a statistical learning framework whereby future
discontinuities (i.e. time-specific shifts) and changes in slope (i.e. linear
trajectories) are estimated given a location's history of the score, dynamic
covariates (other running assessments), and exogenous variables (static
representations). Applying our framework to predict discontinuities in the
anxiety of US counties from COVID-19 events, we found the task was difficult
but more achievable as the sophistication of models was increased, with the
best results coming from integrating exogenous and dynamic covariates. Our
approach shows strong improvement ($r=+.46$ for discontinuity and $r = +.65$
for slope) over traditional static community representations. Discontinuity
forecasting raises new possibilities for estimating the idiosyncratic effects
of potential future or hypothetical events on specific communities.

TL;DR: SNL 和 Auto-SNL 通过 FPGA 上的实时机器学习推理，解决了高频 X 射线实验中的高数据吞吐量问题，并在延迟和资源效率上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高频 X 射线脉冲实验产生的高数据吞吐量（超过 1 TB/s）对传统数据传输和存储基础设施提出了巨大挑战，而现有的机器学习解决方案因延迟过高无法满足需求。

Method: SLAC 开发了 SLAC Neural Network Library (SNL)，这是一个专为 FPGA 设计的框架，支持动态更新模型权重；同时引入了 Auto-SNL，用于将 Python 神经网络模型转换为 SNL 兼容的代码。

Result: 基准测试表明，SNL 在大多数神经网络架构中实现了与当前最先进工具 hls4ml 相当甚至更低的延迟，同时在某些情况下还能节省 FPGA 资源。

Conclusion: SNL 及其扩展 Auto-SNL 为高数据吞吐量的实时机器学习推理提供了一个灵活且高效的解决方案，尤其在需要动态更新模型权重的场景中表现出色。

Abstract: The LCLS-II Free Electron Laser (FEL) will generate X-ray pulses for beamline
experiments at rates of up to 1~MHz, with detectors producing data throughputs
exceeding 1 TB/s. Managing such massive data streams presents significant
challenges, as transmission and storage infrastructures become prohibitively
expensive. Machine learning (ML) offers a promising solution for real-time data
reduction, but conventional implementations introduce excessive latency, making
them unsuitable for high-speed experimental environments. To address these
challenges, SLAC developed the SLAC Neural Network Library (SNL), a specialized
framework designed to deploy real-time ML inference models on
Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA). SNL's key feature is the ability to
dynamically update model weights without requiring FPGA resynthesis, enhancing
flexibility for adaptive learning applications. To further enhance usability
and accessibility, we introduce Auto-SNL, a Python extension that streamlines
the process of converting Python-based neural network models into
SNL-compatible high-level synthesis code. This paper presents a benchmark
comparison against hls4ml, the current state-of-the-art tool, across multiple
neural network architectures, fixed-point precisions, and synthesis
configurations targeting a Xilinx ZCU102 FPGA. The results showed that SNL
achieves competitive or superior latency in most tested architectures, while in
some cases also offering FPGA resource savings. This adaptation demonstrates
SNL's versatility, opening new opportunities for researchers and academics in
fields such as high-energy physics, medical imaging, robotics, and many more.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的多标签排序（MLR）方法UniMLR，通过利用正标签之间的排名信息，而非仅依赖正负标签的二分法，统一了MLR中的排序和分类任务，并引入了合成数据集验证方法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MLR框架仅利用正负标签二分法的信息，忽略了正标签内部的排序信息，限制了模型的性能提升。

Method: 提出UniMLR框架，通过将正标签的排序信息建模为概率分布，统一排序与分类任务，并设计了八个合成数据集（Ranked MNISTs）解决数据稀缺和标注偏差问题。

Result: 实验证明UniMLR能够准确学习正标签的排序顺序，且结果与真实排序一致并显著优于传统方法。

Conclusion: UniMLR通过整合正标签排序信息，显著提升了MLR任务的性能，并为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Existing multi-label ranking (MLR) frameworks only exploit information
deduced from the bipartition of labels into positive and negative sets.
Therefore, they do not benefit from ranking among positive labels, which is the
novel MLR approach we introduce in this paper. We propose UniMLR, a new MLR
paradigm that models implicit class relevance/significance values as
probability distributions using the ranking among positive labels, rather than
treating them as equally important. This approach unifies ranking and
classification tasks associated with MLR. Additionally, we address the
challenges of scarcity and annotation bias in MLR datasets by introducing eight
synthetic datasets (Ranked MNISTs) generated with varying
significance-determining factors, providing an enriched and controllable
experimental environment. We statistically demonstrate that our method
accurately learns a representation of the positive rank order, which is
consistent with the ground truth and proportional to the underlying
significance values. Finally, we conduct comprehensive empirical experiments on
both real-world and synthetic datasets, demonstrating the value of our proposed
framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实中数据异质性（源异质性和用户异质性）限制了心率预测模型的性能，现有方法无法有效解决这一挑战。

Method: 采用随机特征丢弃策略处理源异质性，结合时间感知注意力模块和对比学习目标来管理用户异质性。

Result: 在ParroTao和FitRec数据集上，模型性能分别比基线提升了17%和15%，且学习到的表示具有强判别力。

Conclusion: 论文提出的框架通过随机特征丢弃策略和时间感知注意力模块，有效解决了数据异质性问题，显著提升了心率预测的性能，并通过公开数据集验证了其实际价值。

Abstract: Heart rate prediction is vital for personalized health monitoring and
fitness, while it frequently faces a critical challenge when deploying in
real-world: data heterogeneity. We classify it in two key dimensions: source
heterogeneity from fragmented device markets with varying feature sets, and
user heterogeneity reflecting distinct physiological patterns across
individuals and activities. Existing methods either discard device-specific
information, or fail to model user-specific differences, limiting their
real-world performance. To address this, we propose a framework that learns
latent representations agnostic to both heterogeneity, enabling downstream
predictors to work consistently under heterogeneous data patterns.
Specifically, we introduce a random feature dropout strategy to handle source
heterogeneity, making the model robust to various feature sets. To manage user
heterogeneity, we employ a time-aware attention module to capture long-term
physiological traits and use a contrastive learning objective to build a
discriminative representation space. To reflect the heterogeneous nature of
real-world data, we created and publicly released a new benchmark dataset,
ParroTao. Evaluations on both ParroTao and the public FitRec dataset show that
our model significantly outperforms existing baselines by 17% and 15%,
respectively. Furthermore, analysis of the learned representations demonstrates
their strong discriminative power, and one downstream application task confirm
the practical value of our model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常需要完整的多模态数据或依赖人工选择策略，限制了在数据可用性不一致的真实临床环境中的应用。

Method: 提出MoE-Health框架，采用混合专家模型和动态门控机制，根据可用数据模态动态选择和组合专家网络。

Result: 在MIMIC-IV数据集上的实验表明，MoE-Health在三种临床预测任务中均优于现有方法，且对模态缺失具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MoE-Health框架通过动态选择专家网络，有效整合多模态信息，显著提升了临床预测任务的性能和在各种数据可用性情况下的鲁棒性，适用于数据异构的医疗环境。

Abstract: Healthcare systems generate diverse multimodal data, including Electronic
Health Records (EHR), clinical notes, and medical images. Effectively
leveraging this data for clinical prediction is challenging, particularly as
real-world samples often present with varied or incomplete modalities. Existing
approaches typically require complete modality data or rely on manual selection
strategies, limiting their applicability in real-world clinical settings where
data availability varies across patients and institutions. To address these
limitations, we propose MoE-Health, a novel Mixture of Experts framework
designed for robust multimodal fusion in healthcare prediction. MoE-Health
architecture is specifically developed to handle samples with differing
modalities and improve performance on critical clinical tasks. By leveraging
specialized expert networks and a dynamic gating mechanism, our approach
dynamically selects and combines relevant experts based on available data
modalities, enabling flexible adaptation to varying data availability
scenarios. We evaluate MoE-Health on the MIMIC-IV dataset across three critical
clinical prediction tasks: in-hospital mortality prediction, long length of
stay, and hospital readmission prediction. Experimental results demonstrate
that MoE-Health achieves superior performance compared to existing multimodal
fusion methods while maintaining robustness across different modality
availability patterns. The framework effectively integrates multimodal
information, offering improved predictive performance and robustness in
handling heterogeneous and incomplete healthcare data, making it particularly
suitable for deployment in diverse healthcare environments with heterogeneous
data availability.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对LoRA及其变种（如SVD-LoRA）在大模型上计算成本高且奇异向量难以解释的问题，提出一种更高效且易于解释的参数微调方法。

Method: 论文提出QR-LoRA方法，通过QR分解提取权重矩阵的正交基，并将LoRA更新表示为这些基向量的线性组合，仅训练标量系数以减少参数数量。

Result: 在GLUE任务上的实验表明，QR-LoRA性能优于或等同于全微调、标准LoRA和SVD-LoRA，且参数数量大幅减少（仅需601个参数）。

Conclusion: QR-LoRA是一种高效的参数微调方法，通过QR分解提取正交基并使用标量系数训练，显著减少参数数量，性能优于或等同于传统的LoRA和全微调方法。

Abstract: The growing scale of Large Language Models (LLMs) has necessitated the
development of parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques. Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA) has emerged as a promising approach, reducing the number of trainable
parameters by applying low-rank updates to pretrained weights. While standard
LoRA learns both update factors directly, several recent variants first
initialize those matrices via an SVD of the pretrained weights -- an operation
that can be expensive on large models and yields singular vectors that are not
always easy to interpret. In this work, we extract an orthonormal basis from
the pretrained weight matrix using QR decomposition with column pivoting, and
then express the LoRA update as a linear combination of these basis vectors --
training only the scalar coefficients, which imposes clear structure on
adaptation and drastically reduces parameter count. Experiments across GLUE
tasks show that QR-LoRA matches or exceeds the performance of full fine-tuning,
standard LoRA, and SVD-LoRA (LoRA with update matrices initialized via singular
value decomposition) with as few as 601 parameters -- a reduction of over 1000x
compared to full fine-tuning and 77x fewer than typical LoRA setups.

TL;DR: FLIP是一种基于变压器的生成模型，结合差分隐私和潜在对齐，用于生成公平且隐私保护的表格数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着GDPR、HIPAA等隐私法规和AI伦理框架的普及，如何在风险意识下共享数据并开发模型成为挑战。FLIP旨在解决隐私和公平性问题。

Method: FLIP是一种基于变压器的变分自编码器，通过潜在扩散生成异构表格数据，训练过程中采用Rényi差分隐私约束，并通过Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA)在潜在空间中促进公平性。

Result: 实证结果表明，FLIP在任务无关公平性和多样性下游任务中均显著提升了公平性。

Conclusion: FLIP在差分隐私约束下有效地提升了任务无关公平性，并在多样化的下游任务中表现出色。

Abstract: As privacy regulations such as the GDPR and HIPAA and responsibility
frameworks for artificial intelligence such as the AI Act gain traction, the
ethical and responsible use of real-world data faces increasing constraints.
Synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising solution to risk-aware
data sharing and model development, particularly for tabular datasets that are
foundational to sensitive domains such as healthcare. To address both privacy
and fairness concerns in this setting, we propose FLIP (Fair Latent
Intervention under Privacy guarantees), a transformer-based variational
autoencoder augmented with latent diffusion to generate heterogeneous tabular
data. Unlike the typical setup in fairness-aware data generation, we assume a
task-agnostic setup, not reliant on a fixed, defined downstream task, thus
offering broader applicability. To ensure privacy, FLIP employs R\'enyi
differential privacy (RDP) constraints during training and addresses fairness
in the input space with RDP-compatible balanced sampling that accounts for
group-specific noise levels across multiple sampling rates. In the latent
space, we promote fairness by aligning neuron activation patterns across
protected groups using Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA), a similarity measure
extending the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC). This alignment
encourages statistical independence between latent representations and the
protected feature. Empirical results demonstrate that FLIP effectively provides
significant fairness improvements for task-agnostic fairness and across diverse
downstream tasks under differential privacy constraints.

Abstract: We present an energy conservative, quadrature based model reduction framework
for the compressible Euler equations of Lagrangian hydrodynamics. Building on a
high order finite element discretization of the governing equations, we develop
a projection based reduced model using data driven reduced basis functions and
hyperreduction via the empirical quadrature procedure (EQP). We introduce a
strongly energy conservative variant of EQP that enforces exact discrete total
energy conservation during the hyperreduction process. Numerical experiments
for four benchmark problems -- Sedov blast, Gresho vortex, triple point and
Taylor-Green vortex -- demonstrate that the numerical implementation of our
proposed method conserves total energy to near machine precision while
maintaining accuracy comparable to the basic EQP formulation. These results
establish the energy conservative EQP (CEQP) method as an effective structure
preserving hyperreduction strategy for the reduced simulation of nonlinear
Lagrangian hydrodynamics.

Abstract: We consider parametrized variational inverse problems that are constrained by
partial differential equations (PDEs). We seek to efficiently compute the
solution of the inverse problem when auxiliary model parameters, which appear
in the governing PDE, are varied. Computing the solution of the inverse problem
for different auxiliary parameter values is crucial for uncertainty
quantification. This, however, is computationally challenging since it requires
solving many optimization problems for different realizations of the auxiliary
parameters. We leverage pseudo-time continuation and solve an initial value
problem to evolve the optimal solution along an auxiliary parameter path. This
article introduces the use of an adaptive quasi-Newton Hessian preconditioner
to accelerate the computation. Our proposed preconditioner exploits properties
of the pseudo-time continuation process to achieve reliable and efficient
computation. We elaborate our proposed framework and elucidate its properties
for two nonlinear inverse problems.

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法通过knapsack限制和人工粘性技术，成功实现了高精度、熵稳定且无超参数需求的有限差分格式，同时保持了计算效率。

Abstract: Entropy stable methods have become increasingly popular in the field of
computational fluid dynamics. They often work by satisfying some form of a
discrete entropy inequality: a discrete form of the 2nd law of thermodynamics.
Schemes which satisfy a (semi-)discrete entropy inequality typically behave
much more robustly, and do so in a way that is hyperparameter free. Recently, a
new strategy was introduced to construct entropy stable discontinuous Galerkin
methods: knapsack limiting, which blends together a low order, positivity
preserving, and entropy stable scheme with a high order accurate scheme, in
order to produce a high order accurate, entropy stable, and positivity
preserving scheme. Another recent strategy introduces an entropy correction
artificial viscosity into a high order scheme, aiming to satisfy a cell entropy
inequality.
  In this work, we introduce the techniques of knapsack limiting and artificial
viscosity for finite difference discretizations. The proposed schemes preserve
high order accuracy in sufficiently smooth conditions, are entropy stable, and
are hyperparameter free. Moreover, the proposed knapsack limiting scheme
provably preserves positivity for the compressible Euler and Navier-Stokes
equations. Both schemes achieve this goal without significant performance
tradeoffs compared to state of the art stabilized schemes.

Abstract: Quantum signal processing (QSP) and generalized quantum signal processing

value transformation (GQSVT). Subsequently, we implement the quantum BiCG
method, utilizing GQSVT and swap test, which has a relatively shallow circuit
depth and requires a small number of ancilla qubits.

Abstract: In this study, we present a simulation-based numerical method for solving a
class of singularly perturbed second-order differential equations that come
from a simplified biologically motivated model of human gait. Important
physical factors such as gravity, damping, and leg stiffness are included in
the model, which also depicts the vertical motion of the center of mass of the
body during walking or running. Most of the time, standard numerical methods
are ineffective in resolving boundary layer behavior that occurs due to the
small perturbation parameter in the governing equation. We use a domain
decomposition technique to divide the problem domain into inner and outer
regions to tackle this difficulty. The boundary layer resolves the steep
gradients. We applied a time-rescaling transformation to the inner region. Each
subdomain is discretized, and the resulting tridiagonal systems are efficiently
solved using the Thomas algorithm within the mixed finite difference framework.
A detailed convergence analysis demonstrates second-order accuracy in space.
The numerical results validate the proposed scheme's accuracy, stability, and
efficiency through experiments based on modified human gait models. The
framework serves as a fundamental tool for biomechanical simulation. The
modeling is a foundation for future research, incorporating nonlinearities,
time delays, and real-world scenarios data on how people walk.

Abstract: The ultra--relativistic Euler equations describe gases in the relativistic
case when the thermal energy dominates. These equations for an ideal gas are
given in terms of the pressure, the spatial part of the dimensionless
four-velocity, and the particle density. Kunik et al.\ (2024,
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2024.113330) proposed genuine multi--dimensional
benchmark problems for the ultra--relativistic Euler equations. In particular,
they compared full two-dimensional discontinuous Galerkin simulations for
radially symmetric problems with solutions computed using a specific
one-dimensional scheme. Of particular interest in the solutions are the
formation of shock waves and a pressure blow-up. In the present work we derive
an entropy-stable flux for the ultra--relativistic Euler equations. Therefore,
we derive the main field (or entropy variables) and the corresponding
potentials. We then present the entropy-stable flux and conclude with
simulation results for different test cases both in 2D and in 3D.

Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of reconstructing a random source from
statistical phaseless data for the two-dimensional Helmholtz equation. The
major challenge of this problem is non-uniqueness, which we overcome through a
reference source technique. Firstly, we introduce some artificially added point
sources into the inverse random source system and derive phase retrieval (PR)
formulas for the expectation and variance of the radiated fields. This paper
rigorously analyze the uniqueness and stability of the recovered statistics of
the radiated fields. Afterwards, since the direct problem has a unique mild
solution, by examining the expectation and variance of this solution and
combined with the phase retrieval formulas, we derive the Fredholm integral
equations to solve the inverse random source problem (IRSP). We prove the
stability of the corresponding integral equations. To quantify the uncertainty
of the random source, we utilize the Bayesian method to reconstruct the random
source and establish the well-posedness of the posterior distribution. Finally,
numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and
validate the theoretical results.

Abstract: Kemeny's constant quantifies a graph's connectivity by measuring the average
time for a random walker to reach any other vertex. We introduce two concepts
of the directional derivative of Kemeny's constant with respect to an edge and
use them to define centrality measures for edges and non-edges in the graph.
Additionally, we present a sensitivity measure of Kemeny's constant. An
explicit expression for these quantities involving the inverse of the modified
graph Laplacian is provided, which is valid even for cut-edges. These measures
are connected to the one introduced in [Altafini et al., SIMAX 2023], and
algorithms for their computation are included. The benefits of these measures

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于随机批次方法（RBM）的非重叠域分解技术，用于解决图形上的抛物型偏微分方程，无需空间或时间离散化，显著降低了计算和内存需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复杂系统（如大型管网中的气体传输）模拟需要解决图形上的偏微分方程，传统方法计算和内存成本高，需要更高效的方法。

Method: 采用随机批次方法（RBM），在PDE水平上对图形上的抛物型方程进行非重叠域分解，随机化系数和源项，无需预先离散化。

Result: 理论证明RBM方案均方收敛且时间均匀收敛于真实解，数值实验验证了一阶精度，并显示计算时间和内存消耗显著减少。

Conclusion: RBM方法在保持收敛性的同时，大幅提升了计算效率，适用于不同时间离散方案。

Abstract: The simulation of complex systems, such as gas transport in large pipeline
networks, often involves solving PDEs posed on intricate graph structures. Such
problems require considerable computational and memory resources. The Random
Batch Method (RBM) has shown promise in addressing these challenges via
stochastic decomposition techniques. In this paper, we apply the RBM at the PDE
level for parabolic equations on graphs, without assuming any preliminary
discretization in space or time. We consider a non-overlapping domain
decomposition in which the PDE coefficients and source terms are randomized. We
prove that the resulting RBM-based scheme converges, in the mean-square sense
and uniformly in time, to the true PDE solution with first-order accuracy in
the RBM step size. Numerical experiments confirm this convergence rate and
demonstrate substantial reductions in both memory usage and computational time
compared to solving on the full graph. Moreover, these advantages persist
across different time discretization schemes.

Conclusion: 该研究通过两种不同的数值离散方案解决了Darcy-Forchheimer流体流动模型与温度分布的耦合问题，并通过稳定性分析和迭代算法的收敛性证明，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: We present and analyze in a unified setting two schemes for the numerical
discretization of a Darcy-Forchheimer fluid flow model coupled with an
advection-diffusion equation modeling the temperature distribution in the
fluid. The first approach is based on fully discontinuous Galerkin
discretization spaces. In contrast, in the second approach, the velocity is
approximated in the Raviart-Thomas space, and the pressure and temperature are
still piecewise discontinuous. A fixed-point linearization strategy, naturally
inducing an iterative splitting solution, is proposed for treating the
nonlinearities of the problem. We present a unified stability analysis and
prove the convergence of the iterative algorithm under mild requirements on the
problem data. A wide set of two- and three-dimensional simulations is presented
to assess the error decay and demonstrate the practical performance of the
proposed approaches in physically sound test cases.

Abstract: This paper demonstrates the feasibility of trajectory learning for ensemble
forecasts by employing the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) as a loss

train both additive and multiplicative stochastic parametrizations to generate
ensemble predictions. Results indicate that CRPS-based trajectory learning
produces parametrizations that are both accurate and sharp. The resulting

approach is particularly promising for data assimilation applications due to
its accuracy over short lead times.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Comparing probability distributions is a core challenge across the natural,
social, and computational sciences. Existing methods, such as Maximum Mean
Discrepancy (MMD), struggle in high-dimensional and non-compact domains. Here
we introduce quantum probability metrics (QPMs), derived by embedding
probability measures in the space of quantum states: positive, unit-trace
operators on a Hilbert space. This construction extends kernel-based methods
and overcomes the incompleteness of MMD on non-compact spaces. Viewed as an
integral probability metric (IPM), QPMs have dual functions that uniformly
approximate all bounded, uniformly continuous functions on $\mathbb{R}^n$,
offering enhanced sensitivity to subtle distributional differences in high
dimensions. For empirical distributions, QPMs are readily calculated using
eigenvalue methods, with analytic gradients suited for learning and
optimization. Although computationally more intensive for large sample sizes
($O(n^3)$ vs. $O(n^2)$), QPMs can significantly improve performance as a
drop-in replacement for MMD, as demonstrated in a classic generative modeling
task. By combining the rich mathematical framework of quantum mechanics with
classical probability theory, this approach lays the foundation for powerful
tools to analyze and manipulate probability measures.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于随机加权支持点的生成建模方法，无需复杂假设即可高效生成多样化样本，性能优于GANs和DDPMs。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 支持点通过代表性点集对大数据集进行压缩表示，但传统生成建模方法（如GANs或DDPMs）通常依赖复杂假设或架构。因此，需要一种无需概率假设或神经网络的高效方法。

Method: 基于Dirichlet过程和贝叶斯自举启发的加权方案，提出了随机加权支持点的生成建模框架，并开发了基于凸凹过程（CCP）的高效优化算法。

Result: 在MNIST和CelebA-HQ数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法能以较低计算成本生成高质量且多样化的样本，优于黑盒替代方案。

Conclusion: 随机加权支持点提供了一种原则性、可扩展且可解释的生成建模替代方案，尤其在保持底层数据结构的同时生成多样化样本方面表现出色。

Abstract: Support points summarize a large dataset through a smaller set of
representative points that can be used for data operations, such as Monte Carlo
integration, without requiring access to the full dataset. In this sense,
support points offer a compact yet informative representation of the original
data. We build on this idea to introduce a generative modeling framework based
on random weighted support points, where the randomness arises from a weighting
scheme inspired by the Dirichlet process and the Bayesian bootstrap. The
proposed method generates diverse and interpretable sample sets from a fixed
dataset, without relying on probabilistic modeling assumptions or neural
network architectures. We present the theoretical formulation of the method and
develop an efficient optimization algorithm based on the Convex--Concave
Procedure (CCP). Empirical results on the MNIST and CelebA-HQ datasets show
that our approach produces high-quality and diverse outputs at a fraction of
the computational cost of black-box alternatives such as Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs) or Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs). These
results suggest that random weighted support points offer a principled,
scalable, and interpretable alternative for generative modeling. A key feature
is their ability to produce genuinely interpolative samples that preserve
underlying data structure.

Motivation: 改善生成矩匹配网络（GMMNs）在拟合copula随机数生成器时的学习能力，提升训练性能和模型预测效果。

Method: 通过自适应带宽选择程序增加核数量，并利用验证损失的相对误差作为早期停止标准。

Result: AGMMNs的训练时间与GMMNs相似，但训练性能显著提升，适用于高维copula生成和金融应用。

Conclusion: AGMMNs在训练性能和模型预测方面均优于传统GMMNs和经典参数化copula模型，适用于高维copula生成和金融数据分析。

Abstract: An adaptive bandwidth selection procedure for the mixture kernel in the
maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) for fitting generative moment matching networks
(GMMNs) is introduced, and its ability to improve the learning of copula random
number generators is demonstrated. Based on the relative error of the training
loss, the number of kernels is increased during training; additionally, the
relative error of the validation loss is used as an early stopping criterion.
While training time of such adaptively trained GMMNs (AGMMNs) is similar to
that of GMMNs, training performance is increased significantly in comparison to
GMMNs, which is assessed and shown based on validation MMD trajectories,
samples and validation MMD values. Superiority of AGMMNs over GMMNs, as well as
typical parametric copula models, is demonstrated in terms of three
applications. First, convergence rates of quasi-random versus pseudo-random
samples from high-dimensional copulas are investigated for three functionals of
interest and in dimensions as large as 100 for the first time. Second,
replicated validation MMDs, as well as Monte Carlo and quasi-Monte Carlo
applications based on the expected payoff of a basked call option and the risk
measure expected shortfall as functionals are used to demonstrate the improved
training of AGMMNs over GMMNs for a copula model fitted to the standardized
residuals of the 50 constituents of the S&P 500 index after deGARCHing. Last,
both the latter dataset and 50 constituents of the FTSE~100 are used to
demonstrate that the improved training of AGMMNs over GMMNs and in comparison
to the fitting of classical parametric copula models indeed also translates to
an improved model prediction.

Conclusion: 研究表明，在混合扩散算子中，分数拉普拉斯算子的影响优于经典拉普拉斯算子，尤其是在初始层中，决定了传播速率和尾部厚度的指数特性。

Abstract: Our investigation focuses on the asymptotic spreading behavior of the
Fisher-KPP equation with a mixed local-nonlocal operator in the diffusion (see
the work by X. Cabr\'e and J.-M. Roquejoffre, 2013, ref.[8]) to the setting of
mixed diffusion, which involves both the classical and the fractional Laplacian
in order to analyze the long-time dynamics of the equation. A key step in our
approach involves the construction and detailed study of the heat kernel
associated with the mixed operator, which we use to develop a theory of mild
solutions and establish a comparison principle in suitable weighted function
spaces.
  This framework allows us to rigorously establish the non-existence of
traveling waves and characterize the large-time spreading rate of solutions. We
show that the influence of the fractional Laplacian dominates over the
classical Laplacian, especially in the initial layer, where it dictates the
exponential propagation rate and the thickness of the solution tails.

Abstract: We consider the transmission eigenvalues for a bounded scatterer with a

contrast to be of one sign, in which case the transmission eigenvalue problem
can be written in terms of operators corresponding to a fourth order PDE with
periodic coefficients. We perform two-scale asymptotics for this biharmonic
type homogenization problem and show convergence estimates which require a
boundary corrector function, and this boundary corrector function appears in
the formula for the transmission eigenvalues correction.

Abstract: In this paper, we analyse the dynamics of a pattern-forming system close to
simultaneous Turing and Turing--Hopf instabilities, which have a 1:1 spatial
resonance, that is, they have the same critical wave number. For this, we
consider a system of coupled Swift--Hohenberg equations with dispersive terms
and general, smooth nonlinearities. Close to the onset of instability, we
derive a system of two coupled complex Ginzburg--Landau equations with a
singular advection term as amplitude equations and justify the approximation by
providing error estimates. We then construct space-time periodic solutions to
the amplitude equations, as well as fast-travelling front solutions, which
connect different space-time periodic states. This yields the existence of
solutions to the pattern-forming system on a finite, but long time interval,
which model the spatial transition between different patterns. The construction
is based on geometric singular perturbation theory exploiting the fast
travelling speed of the fronts. Finally, we construct global, spatially
periodic solutions to the pattern-forming system by using centre manifold
reduction, normal form theory and a variant of singular perturbation theory to
handle fast oscillatory higher-order terms.

Method: 通过分析调和函数梯度在具有正Hausdorff内容的集合上的小性，推导其在更大区域上的梯度上界。

Result: 证明了在单位球中，若调和函数的梯度在小集合上为$ϵ$-小，则在整个$B_{1/2}$上的梯度上界为$Cϵ^α$，其中$C,α$仅依赖于维度、$δ$和Hausdorff内容。

Conclusion: 本文证明了在特定条件下，调和函数的梯度在单位球中的小区域上的小性可以传播到更大的区域，且结果对维度和Hausdorff内容具有依赖性。

Abstract: Let $u$ be a harmonic function in the unit ball $B_1 \subset \mathbb R^n$,
normalized so that its gradient has magnitude at most 1 on the unit ball. We
show that if the gradient of $u$ is $\epsilon$-small in size on a set $E\subset
B_{1/2}$ with positive $(n-2+\delta)$-dimensional Hausdorff content for some
$\delta>0$, then $\sup_{B_{1/2}} |\nabla u| \leq C \epsilon^\alpha$ with
$C,\alpha>0$ depending only on $n,\delta$ and the $(n-2+\delta)$-Hausdorff
content of $E$. This is an improvement over a similar result of Logunov and
Malinnikova that required $\delta>1-c_n$ for a small dimensional constant $c_n$
and reaches the sharp threshold for the dimension of the smallness sets from
which propagation of smallness can occur.

Abstract: We prove stability results in hypercontractivity estimates for the Hopf--Lax

we use recent stability results for the Pr\'ekopa--Leindler inequality, due to
B\"or\"oczky and De (2021), Figalli and Ramos (2024) and Figalli, van Hintum,

results turn out to be sharp, as they are reflected in the optimal exponent
$1/2$ both in the hypercontractivity and $L^p$-logarithmic Sobolev deficits,
respectively. This approach also works for establishing stability of Gaussian

Conclusion: 论文的主要结论是建立了抛物控制系统的$F$-等价对的唯一性条件，并提供了快速稳定化半线性抛物系统的构造方法。

Abstract: We consider the $F$-equivalence problem for parabolic systems: under which
conditions a control system, governed by a parabolic operator $A$ and a control
operator $B$, can be made equivalent to an arbitrarily exponentially stable
evolution system through an appropriate control feedback law? While this
problem has been resolved for finite-dimensional systems fifty years ago, good
conditions for infinite-dimensional systems remain a challenge, especially for
systems in spatial dimension larger than one. Our main result establishes
optimal conditions for the existence of an $F$-equivalence pair $(T,K)$ for a
given parabolic control system $(A,B)$. We introduce an extended framework for
$F$-equivalence of parabolic operators, addressing key limitations of existing
approaches, and we prove that the pair $(T,K)$ is unique if and only if $(A,B)$
is approximately controllable. As a consequence, this provides a method to
construct feedback operators for the rapid stabilization of semilinear
parabolic systems, possibly multi-dimensional in space. We provide several
illustrative examples, including the rapid stabilization of the heat equation,
the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, the Navier-Stokes equations and the

TL;DR: 论文研究了带势能项和非齐次权重的广义Hartree方程，证明了在非径向初始数据下临界情况的散射性，并建立了小数据的全局适定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究的动机是解决广义非齐次Hartree方程在包含势能项和非齐次权重时的散射性问题，这在之前的工作中尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 作者通过Murphy的一般策略，结合Tao的散射准则和局部化Morawetz估计，处理了方程中的非齐次权重和势能项，并使用了合适的Strichartz对来建立小数据的全局适定性。

Result: 论文证明了在满足质量和势能条件的情况下，方程的解在临界情况下会散射。同时，作者还建立了小数据的全局适定性。

Conclusion: 论文证明了在非径向初始数据下，广义非齐次Hartree方程在临界情况下的散射性，并通过引入新的质量和势能条件扩展了传统的质量-能量阈值。

Abstract: In this work, we consider the focusing generalized inhomogeneous Hartree
equation with potential \[ i u_t + \Delta u - V(x)u + \left(I_{\gamma} *
|x|^{-b}|u|^{p}\right)|x|^{-b}|u|^{p-2}u = 0, \] where $0<\gamma<3$ and
$0<b<\frac{1+\gamma}{2}$. We prove scattering in the intercritical case for
nonradial initial data, under a mass-potential condition that generalizes the
usual mass-energy threshold. The main new points compared to previous works are
the inhomogeneous weight $|x|^{-b}$ and the presence of a potential $V$, which
lead us to study the perturbed operator $-\Delta + V$.
  Our proof follows the general strategy of Murphy, but we need to adapt
several steps to deal with the weight and the potential. We use Tao's
scattering criterion together with localized Morawetz estimates in this
setting. As a preliminary step, we establish global well-posedness for small
data, which, in the presence of $V$, requires careful analysis using
appropriate admissible Strichartz pairs.

TL;DR: 开发了一种便携式风扇阵列风洞，能在1米内生成线性剪切流，适用于无人机测试，并研究了多种流速分布下的湍流特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统风洞需要较长的流动发展距离才能实现特定的流速分布（如线性剪切流或边界层流），这在某些应用中不够灵活或便携。因此，开发一种更紧凑、便携的风洞系统，以满足现代无人机测试的需求。

Abstract: Wind tunnel's consisting an array of computer controlled/programmable fans
have evolved over the last three decades for simulating the atmospheric
turbulence to study the aerodynamic loads over bluff bodies such as buildings
and bridges. In addition to civil engineering structures, these wind tunnels
can also have applications extending towards free-flight aerodynamic tests on
drones and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Achieving velocity profiles such as
linearly sheared flows or boundary layer flows in a traditional wind tunnel
would require long fetch lengths for the flow to evolve. However, in this work,
with the aid of an array of computer-controlled fans, a perfectly linearly
sheared flow can be developed at a distance of 1 meter from the source. Unlike
the previous fan-array wind tunnels (FAWT) developed for atmospheric boundary
layer flows, the fan-array tunnel constructed in this work does not include a
contraction section or a honeycomb, offering portability and compactness for
performing unconfined flight tests. The current work involves the design and
development of a 10 x 10 two-dimensional array of multiple fans facing a 2.4 m
long, enclosed test section with a 1.44 $m^2$ cross-sectional area. A
comprehensive characterization of key flow parameters, including turbulence
intensity, mean velocity, and pressure, in the streamwise, spanwise, and
transverse directions of the test section is investigated in the developed
FAWT. These measurements were conducted under three distinct flow conditions,
namely uniform, linearly sheared, and parabolic. Additionally, this work also
presents the evolution of the turbulent length scales and time scales across
various sections inside the tunnel for a range of wind speeds by employing
autocorrelation techniques and power spectral analysis.

Method: 通过微扰方法解析推导了流函数和体积流量的级数解，并运用DPD和MPCD这两种基于粒子的介观方法进行模拟。

Result: DPD、MPCD与四阶级数解在多种微通道几何形状下表现良好，但介观方法在壁面存在滑移，导致速度和流量轻微高估。级数解在短通道或大振幅时失效。

Conclusion: DPD和MPCD是相对准确且方便的数值模拟方法，尤其在系列解法失效或难以实现时展现出优势。

Abstract: We computationally study the flow of Newtonian fluids through sinusoidal
expansion-contraction microchannels at low Reynolds number. We first use a
perturbation method to analytically derive series solutions for the stream
function and volumetric flow rate that extend prior work [P.K. Kitanidis and
B.B. Dykaar, Transport in Porous Media 26, 89-98 (1997)] up to tenth order. We
then employ two particle-based mesoscale methods, dissipative particle dynamics
(DPD) and multiparticle collision dynamics (MPCD), to simulate the same flows.
We find that the fluid velocity at the expansion and contraction points as well
as the volumetric flow rate are in good agreement between DPD, MPCD, and the
fourth-order series solution for a wide range of microchannel geometries. The
mesoscale fluid models exhibit some slip at the walls, leading to a small but
consistent overprediction of the velocity and volumetric flow rate. The series
solution fails for short microchannel lengths and large amplitudes; we identify
lengths and amplitudes for which it converges to a given order. Overall, we
find that DPD and MPCD are convenient and reasonably accurate methods,
particularly for microchannel geometries where the series solution fails or is
cumbersome to implement.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of Lagrangian trajectories in turbulent flow remains
challenging due to limited temporal information in transport functions. This
paper shows that even with sparse temporal observations, there might be enough
information from surrounding coherent motions, sharing the same dynamics, to
provide highly probable trajectories. The proposed coherent predictor is
derived from the concept of Lagrangian coherent structures (LCSs), which are
advective transport barriers that govern the cohesive motion of neighbouring
particles. Coherent trajectories are quantified using a local segmentation with
the finite-time Lyapunov exponents (FTLE). The coherent predictor incorporates
information from the particle's position history and neighbouring coherent
velocity and acceleration into a novel generic energy function to predict its
trajectory. We assess our proposed approach using both three-dimensional (3D)
synthetic and experimental data of the wake behind a smooth cylinder and
two-dimensional (2D) homogeneous isotropic turbulent (HIT) flow. The coherent
predictor is deemed generic due to its consistent behaviour regardless of flow
dimensions, Reynolds number, and flow topology. Our results demonstrate that
the optimal parameters of the proposed energy function can be modelled based on
measurement uncertainties, resulting in enhanced prediction accuracy and
reduced uncertainty compared to current methods. We reveal direct signatures of
flow topology, including the cylinder leading edge boundary layer, sideward
shear layers, and vortex formation structures, on the prediction error map.
These topologies, which are fundamental structures in fluid dynamics, are
marked by high Lagrangian gradients and 3D directional motions. These findings
on coherent predictions hold great potential for various Lagrangian analyses in
turbulence.

Motivation: 海山被视为海洋的'搅拌棒'，引发了对其附近湍流特征的兴趣，尤其是在潮汐与三维地形相互作用的情况下。

Method: 采用大涡模拟（LES）研究潮汐主导流（叠加较弱平均流的潮汐振荡）经过理想化陡峭海山的湍流混合过程。

Conclusion: 海山尾流在潮汐作用下显著促进混合，尤其在反转阶段效率最高，为海洋湍流混合研究提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Oceanic turbulence influences the transport and mixing of freshwater, heat,
nutrients, and other biogeochemical tracers. It also has broader implications
for oceanic and atmospheric circulations. Tides contribute substantially to the
mechanically driven turbulent ocean mixing through the internal waves resulting
from tide-topography interactions. Tidal currents also drive turbulent wakes
and shear layers when the topography is 3D. The hypothesis that seamounts are
the ``stirring rods'' of the ocean has motivated considerable recent interest
in turbulent flow features near 3D topography. It also motivates the present
LES of tidally dominated flows (tidal oscillations superposed on a weaker mean)
past an idealized steep seamount. Complex interactions occur between the
topography, the near wake, and previously shed vortices, especially during the
tidal phases when the flow direction is reversed. The topographic wake is shown
to be a hotspot for mixing, featuring large dissipation rates in the attached
shear layers, hydraulic jet, recirculation region in the near wake, and
peripheries of shed vortices. The majority of the observed dissipation is due
to the vertical shear. Over a tidal cycle, the volume-integrated local
dissipation within the wake is at least four times greater than the internal
wave flux that may be dissipated elsewhere. Furthermore, normalized dissipation
rates are maximized for the purely tidal setting. Within the tidal cycle, bulk
mixing efficiency ($\eta$) varies substantially and is maximized at $\eta
\approx 0.25$ around flow reversals.

Conclusion: 本研究揭示了连续相粘度对液-液两相Taylor-Couette流动转变的影响，发现不同流动阶段转变的幂律关系中，A值对连续相粘度有不同的依赖性。稳定带状流的形成机制与液滴惯性丧失相关。

Abstract: A liquid-liquid two-phase Taylor-Couette flow is of fundamental and practical
importance in multiphase flow systems. This study investigates the flow
transitions in such a system with constant axial flow and gradually increased
rotation of the inner cylinder. To clarify the effect of continuous-phase
viscosity on flow transitions, several concentrations of glycerol-water
solutions were employed as the continuous phase, while soybean oil was used as
the dispersed phase. Visualization experiments revealed that the flow undergoes
a cascade of transitions: stratified flow, disturbed stratified flow,
transitional droplet flow (observed only in limited cases), unstable banded
flow, and stable banded flow. A flow map was constructed using two
dimensionless parameters, Reynolds number (Re) and Weber number (We). The
transitions from disturbed stratified to unstable banded flow (TR I) and from
unstable to stable banded flow (TR II) were found to be approximately expressed
by a power-law relation of the form We ~ Re^A, where A is a fitting exponent.
For TR I, A showed no clear dependence on continuous-phase viscosity,
suggesting the combined effects of inertia, viscosity, and interfacial tension.
In contrast, A decreased with increasing viscosity in TR II, becoming nearly
zero at high glycerol concentration. Furthermore, to clarify the mechanism of
stable banded flow formation, the droplet inertia was evaluated using the
Stokes number (St). It was revealed that the stable banded structure results
from the loss of droplet inertia, associated with droplet micronization under
higher rotation and the increasing inertia of the continuous phase.

Abstract: This study establishes a symmetry-based framework to quantify non-equilibrium
processes in complex pressure gradient (PG) turbulent boundary layers (TBLs),
using a Lie-group-informed dilation-symmetry-breaking formalism. We derive a
universal multilayer defect scaling law for the evolution of total shear stress
(TSS). The law shows that gradually varying adverse pressure gradients (APGs)
break the dilation symmetry in the two-layer defect scaling of equilibrium TSS,
leading to three-layer TSS structures. For abrupt PG transitions, we identify
boundary-layer decoupling into: 1) an equilibrium internal boundary layer, and
2) a history-dependent outer flow, arising from disparate adaptation
timescales. The framework introduces a unified velocity scale mapping
non-equilibrium TSS to canonical zero-PG scaling. Validation spans different
aerodynamic systems, including developing APG on airfoils, APG-to-favorable-PG
transition on a Gaussian bump, and favorable PG to rapidly amplifying APG in a
converging-diverging channel. The work enables improved prediction of
non-equilibrium PG TBL behavior through unified characterization of stress
evolution dynamics, providing new physics-based parameterizations that could
promote machine learning of complex wall-bounded turbulent flows.

Conclusion: 该研究发现，尽管磁场对汞流的强烈阻尼效应通常具有稳定作用，但在特定参数下，两种流体在界面的相互作用以及气体层中的剪切诱导不稳定性可能导致流动失稳，尤其是在磁场增强的情况下。

Abstract: Long wave instability of a stratified two-phase MHD parallel flow between two
infinite plates is studied. It is argued that electric conductivity of the
plates affects qualitatively the base flow and its stability properties, which
calls for separate stability studies for the cases of perfectly insulating,
perfectly conducting boundaries, or boundaries with finite conductivity. In
this study we examine the effect of the transverse magnetic field on long wave
instability of a two-layer flow consisting of layers of conductive liquid and
non-conductive gas, for the cases of perfectly insulating or perfectly
conducting lower boundary, considering a mercury-air system as a representative
test case. To capture the behavior at small but finite wavenumbers, we extend
the conventional first-order long-wave stability analysis by incorporating
higher order terms. The results and discussion address the characteristics of
the base flow, stability maps and profiles of the most unstable disturbances.
The stability diagrams show that among the anticipated stabilizing effect of
the magnetic field, at certain parameters a destabilization is observed. It is
further argued that in spite the flow of mercury is strongly damped by the
magnetic field, interaction of the two fluids at the interface becomes the
strongest destabilizing effect, which, together with the shear-induced
instabilities in the gas layer, may lead to flow destabilization with the
increasing magnetic field.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了在水平圆柱体上薄黏性薄膜流动的复杂行为，高频率和低频率极限下的渐近分析表明，通过适当的初始条件和振幅控制可以延迟或避免薄膜的翻转问题。

Abstract: The flow of a thin viscous film on the outside of a horizontal circular
cylinder, whose angular velocity is time-periodic with specified frequency and
amplitude, is investigated. The constant angular velocity problem was
originally studied by Moffatt (1977) and Pukhnachev (1977). Surface tension is
neglected. The evolution equation for the film thickness is solved numerically
for a range of oscillation amplitudes and frequency. A blow-up map charted in
amplitude-frequency space reveals highly intricate fractal-like structures
exhibiting self-similarity. For a general initial condition the film surface
reaches a slope singularity at a finite time and tends to overturn. The
high-frequency and low-frequency limits are examined asymptotically using a
multiple-scales approach. At high frequency the analysis suggests that an
appropriate choice of initial profile can substantially delay the overturning
time, and even yield a time-periodic solution. In the low-frequency limit it is
possible to construct a quasi-periodic solution that does not overturn if the
oscillation amplitude lies below a threshold value. Above this value the
solution tends inexorably toward blow-up. It is shown how solutions exhibiting
either a single-shock or a double-shock may be constructed in common with the
steadily rotating cylinder problem.

Conclusion: CDHD方法在模拟跨临界流动时表现出较高的准确性和稳定性，尤其在减少能量守恒误差方面有显著改进，使其成为复杂真实气体流动模拟的可靠工具。

Abstract: The simulation of transcritical flows remains challenging due to strong
thermodynamic nonlinearities that induce spurious pressure oscillations in
conventional schemes.While primitive-variable formulations offer improved
robustness under such conditions, they are always limited by energy
conservation errors and the absence of systematic high-order treatments for
numerical fluxes. In this paper, we introduce the Central Differential flux
with High-Order Dissipation (CDHD), a novel numerical flux solver designed for
primitive-variable discretization. This method combines a central flux for
advection with a minimal, upwind-biased dissipation term to stabilize the
simulation while maintaining formal accuracy. The dissipation term effectively
suppresses oscillations and improves stability in transcritical flows. Compared
to traditional primitive-variable approaches, CDHD reduces the energy
conservation error in two order of magnitude. When incorporated into a hybrid
framework with a conservative shock-capturing scheme, the method robustly
handles both smooth transcritical phenomena and shock waves. Numerical tests
validate the accuracy, stability, and energy-preserving capabilities of CDHD,
demonstrating its potential as a reliable tool for complex real-gas flow
simulations.

Abstract: Accurate real-time forecasting of cryogenic tank behavior is essential for
the safe and efficient operation of propulsion and storage systems in future
deep-space missions. While cryogenic fluid management (CFM) systems
increasingly require autonomous capabilities, conventional simulation methods
remain hindered by high computational cost, model imperfections, and
sensitivity to unanticipated boundary condition changes. To address these
limitations, this study proposes an Adaptive Real-Time Forecasting Framework
for Cryogenic Propellant Management in Space Systems, featuring a lightweight,
non-intrusive method named ARCTIC (Adaptive Real-time Cryogenic Tank Inference
and Correction). ARCTIC integrates real-time sensor data with precomputed nodal
simulations through a data-driven correction layer that dynamically refines
forecast accuracy without modifying the underlying model. Two updating
mechanisms, auto-calibration and observation and correction, enable continuous
adaptation to evolving system states and transient disturbances. The method is
first assessed through synthetic scenarios representing self-pressurization,
sloshing, and periodic operations, then validated using experimental data from
NASA's Multipurpose Hydrogen Test Bed and K-Site facilities. Results
demonstrate that ARCTIC significantly improves forecast accuracy under model
imperfections, data noise, and boundary fluctuations, offering a robust
real-time forecasting capability to support autonomous CFM operations. The
framework's compatibility with existing simulation tools and its low
computational overhead make it especially suited for onboard implementation in
space systems requiring predictive autonomy.

Abstract: We study how architectural inductive biases influence the cognitive behavior
of large language models (LLMs) in instructional dialogue. We introduce a
symbolic scaffolding mechanism paired with a short-term memory schema designed
to promote adaptive, structured reasoning in Socratic tutoring. Using
controlled ablation across five system variants, we evaluate model outputs via
expert-designed rubrics covering scaffolding, responsiveness, symbolic
reasoning, and conversational memory. We present preliminary results using an
LLM-based evaluation framework aligned to a cognitively grounded rubric. This
enables scalable, systematic comparisons across architectural variants in
early-stage experimentation. The preliminary results show that our full system
consistently outperforms baseline variants. Analysis reveals that removing
memory or symbolic structure degrades key cognitive behaviors, including
abstraction, adaptive probing, and conceptual continuity. These findings
support a processing-level account in which architectural scaffolds can
reliably shape emergent instructional strategies in LLMs.

Abstract: In the past two years, large language model (LLM)-based chatbots, such as
ChatGPT, have revolutionized various domains by enabling diverse task
completion and question-answering capabilities. However, their application in
scientific research remains constrained by challenges such as hallucinations,
limited domain-specific knowledge, and lack of explainability or traceability
for the response. Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has
emerged as a promising approach to improving chatbot reliability by integrating
domain-specific contextual information before response generation, addressing
some limitations of standard LLMs. Despite its potential, there are only
limited studies that evaluate GraphRAG on specific domains that require
intensive knowledge, like Alzheimer's disease or other biomedical domains. In
this paper, we assess the quality and traceability of two popular GraphRAG
systems. We compile a database of 50 papers and 70 expert questions related to
Alzheimer's disease, construct a GraphRAG knowledge base, and employ GPT-4o as
the LLM for answering queries. We then compare the quality of responses

Motivation: 现有研究主要集中于单一或孤立的本体系统，缺乏对跨本体关系的整合，限制了医学概念表示学习的潜力。

Method: LINKO利用大型语言模型（LLM）增强的异构本体系统知识传播，包括纵向（层级内）和横向（跨本体）传播，以提升医学概念表示学习。

Result: LINKO在两个公开数据集上表现出优于现有基线的性能，并在数据有限和罕见疾病预测场景中展示了更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: LINKO作为一种插件式编码器，在数据有限和罕见疾病预测场景中表现出更强的鲁棒性，验证了其优越性能。

Abstract: Medical ontology graphs map external knowledge to medical codes in electronic
health records via structured relationships. By leveraging domain-approved
connections (e.g., parent-child), predictive models can generate richer medical
concept representations by incorporating contextual information from related
concepts. However, existing literature primarily focuses on incorporating
domain knowledge from a single ontology system, or from multiple ontology
systems (e.g., diseases, drugs, and procedures) in isolation, without
integrating them into a unified learning structure. Consequently, concept
representation learning often remains limited to intra-ontology relationships,
overlooking cross-ontology connections. In this paper, we propose LINKO, a
large language model (LLM)-augmented integrative ontology learning framework
that leverages multiple ontology graphs simultaneously by enabling dual-axis
knowledge propagation both within and across heterogeneous ontology systems to
enhance medical concept representation learning. Specifically, LINKO first
employs LLMs to provide a graph-retrieval-augmented initialization for ontology
concept embedding, through an engineered prompt that includes concept
descriptions, and is further augmented with ontology context. Second, our
method jointly learns the medical concepts in diverse ontology graphs by
performing knowledge propagation in two axes: (1) intra-ontology vertical
propagation across hierarchical ontology levels and (2) inter-ontology
horizontal propagation within every level in parallel. Last, through extensive
experiments on two public datasets, we validate the superior performance of
LINKO over state-of-the-art baselines. As a plug-in encoder compatible with
existing EHR predictive models, LINKO further demonstrates enhanced robustness
in scenarios involving limited data availability and rare disease prediction.

TL;DR: TiG框架通过语言建模和在线强化学习，使LLMs在交互任务中表现出色，并保持解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在复杂推理任务中表现出色，但在简单交互任务中表现不佳，这促使研究如何将静态知识转化为动态决策。

Method: TiG通过将基于强化学习的决策制定重新表述为语言建模任务，生成语言引导的策略，并通过在线强化学习迭代优化。

Result: TiG在降低数据和计算需求的同时，达到了与传统强化学习方法竞争的性能，并提供了逐步的自然语言解释。

Conclusion: TiG框架成功地将大型语言模型（LLMs）的声明性知识与程序性知识结合，在交互任务中表现出色，同时保持了模型的解释性和透明度。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning tasks such as
mathematics and coding, yet they frequently struggle with simple interactive
tasks that young children perform effortlessly. This discrepancy highlights a
critical gap between declarative knowledge (knowing about something) and
procedural knowledge (knowing how to do something). Although traditional
reinforcement learning (RL) agents can acquire procedural knowledge through
environmental interaction, they often operate as black boxes and require
substantial training data. In contrast, LLMs possess extensive world knowledge
and reasoning capabilities, but are unable to effectively convert this static
knowledge into dynamic decision-making in interactive settings. To address this
challenge, we propose Think in Games (TiG), a novel framework that empowers
LLMs to develop procedural understanding through direct interaction with game
environments, while retaining their inherent reasoning and explanatory
abilities. Specifically, TiG reformulates RL-based decision-making as a
language modeling task: LLMs generate language-guided policies, which are
refined iteratively through online reinforcement learning based on
environmental feedback. Our experimental results show that TiG successfully
bridges the gap between declarative and procedural knowledge, achieving
competitive performance with dramatically lower data and computational demands
compared to conventional RL methods. Moreover, TiG provides step-by-step
natural language explanations for its decisions, greatly improving transparency
and interpretability in complex interactive tasks.

TL;DR: AHELM是一个新的音频语言模型评估基准，通过标准化测试揭示了模型表现和不公平性，其中Gemini 2.5 Pro在多个方面领先但存在公平性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频语言模型的评估缺乏标准化和全面性，无法公平比较不同模型的表现。

Method: AHELM整合了多个数据集（包括新合成的PARADE和CoRe-Bench），并标准化了提示、推理参数和评估指标，以全面测试14个音频语言模型的能力。

Result: Gemini 2.5 Pro在10个方面中的5个表现最佳，但在ASR任务中存在群体不公平性（p=0.01）；基线系统表现不俗，其中一个甚至排名第五。

Conclusion: AHELM基准测试通过标准化评估方法和全面的测试覆盖，揭示了音频语言模型在不同方面的表现和不公平性，为未来模型开发提供了透明且持续更新的评估框架。

Abstract: Evaluations of audio-language models (ALMs) -- multimodal models that take
interleaved audio and text as input and output text -- are hindered by the lack
of standardized benchmarks; most benchmarks measure only one or two
capabilities and omit evaluative aspects such as fairness or safety.
Furthermore, comparison across models is difficult as separate evaluations test
a limited number of models and use different prompting methods and inference
parameters. To address these shortfalls, we introduce AHELM, a benchmark that
aggregates various datasets -- including 2 new synthetic audio-text datasets
called PARADE, which evaluates the ALMs on avoiding stereotypes, and
CoRe-Bench, which measures reasoning over conversational audio through
inferential multi-turn question answering -- to holistically measure the
performance of ALMs across 10 aspects we have identified as important to the
development and usage of ALMs: audio perception, knowledge, reasoning, emotion
detection, bias, fairness, multilinguality, robustness, toxicity, and safety.
We also standardize the prompts, inference parameters, and evaluation metrics
to ensure equitable comparisons across models. We test 14 open-weight and
closed-API ALMs from 3 developers and 3 additional simple baseline systems each
consisting of an automatic speech recognizer and a language model. Our results
show that while Gemini 2.5 Pro ranks top in 5 out of 10 aspects, it exhibits
group unfairness ($p=0.01$) on ASR tasks whereas most of the other models do
not. We also find that the baseline systems perform reasonably well on AHELM,
with one ranking 5th overall despite having only speech-to-text capabilities.
For transparency, all raw prompts, model generations, and outputs are available
on our website at https://crfm.stanford.edu/helm/audio/v1.0.0. AHELM is
intended to be a living benchmark and new datasets and models will be added
over time.

Conclusion: 本文不仅扩展了对认知状态中遗忘操作的理解，还为未来研究提供了新的框架和评估标准。

Abstract: Forgetting as a knowledge management operation deliberately ignores parts of
the knowledge and beliefs of an agent, for various reasons. Forgetting has many
facets, one may want to forget parts of the syntax, a proposition, or a
conditional. In the literature, two main operators suitable for performing
forgetting have been proposed and investigated in depth: First, variable
elimination is a syntactical method that blends out certain atomic variables to
focus on the rest of the language. It has been mainly used in the area of logic
programming and answer set programming. Second, contraction in AGM belief
revision theory effectively removes propositions from belief sets under logical
deduction. Both operations rely mainly on classical logics. In this article, we
take an epistemic perspective and study forgetting operations in epistemic
states with richer semantic structures, but with clear links to propositional
logic. This allows us to investigate what forgetting in the epistemic
background means, thereby lifting well-known and novel forgetting operations to
the epistemic level. We present five general types of epistemic forgetting and
instantiate them with seven concrete forgetting operations for Spohn's ranking
functions. We take inspiration from postulates of forgetting both from logic
programming and AGM theory to propose a rich landscape of axioms for evaluating
forgetting operations. Finally, we evaluate all concrete forgetting operations
according to all postulates, leading to a novel comprehensive overview
highlighting differences and commonalities among the forgetting operators.

TL;DR: 论文提出STRIPS+模型和SYNTH算法，用于从部分观测的状态-动作轨迹中学习模型，解决了现有方法对完全可观测性的依赖问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的状态和动作往往是不完整的，而现有的方法大多假设动作和状态是完全可观测的。因此，需要一种更灵活的方法来处理这种部分观测的场景。

Method: 论文引入了STRIPS+模型，允许在前提条件中隐含某些动作参数，并提出了一种分层构造前提表达式的方法。SYNTH算法通过构建预处理表达式的分层序列来学习模型。

Result: 实验结果证明，SYNTH算法能够有效学习STRIPS+模型，并在现有的STRIPS领域中表现出可扩展性。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种名为STRIPS+的变体模型，以解决从部分观测的状态-动作轨迹中学习模型的问题。通过SYNTH算法，成功地学习了STRIPS+模型，并在实验中验证了其正确性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Consider the problem of learning a lifted STRIPS model of the sliding-tile
puzzle from random state-action traces where the states represent the location
of the tiles only, and the actions are the labels up, down, left, and right,
with no arguments. Two challenges are involved in this problem. First, the
states are not full STRIPS states, as some predicates are missing, like the
atoms representing the position of the ``blank''. Second, the actions are not
full STRIPS either, as they do not reveal all the objects involved in the
actions effects and preconditions. Previous approaches have addressed different
versions of this model learning problem, but most assume that actions in the
traces are full STRIPS actions or that the domain predicates are all
observable. The new setting considered in this work is more ``realistic'', as
the atoms observed convey the state of the world but not full STRIPS states,
and the actions reveal the arguments needed for selecting the action but not
the ones needed for modeling it in STRIPS. For formulating and addressing the
learning problem, we introduce a variant of STRIPS, which we call STRIPS+,
where certain STRIPS action arguments can be left implicit in preconditions
which can also involve a limited form of existential quantification. The
learning problem becomes the problem of learning STRIPS+ models from STRIPS+
state-action traces. For this, the proposed learning algorithm, called SYNTH,
constructs a stratified sequence (conjunction) of precondition expressions or
``queries'' for each action, that denote unique objects in the state and ground
the implicit action arguments in STRIPS+. The correctness and completeness of
SYNTH is established, and its scalability is tested on state-action traces
obtained from STRIPS+ models derived from existing STRIPS domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态浏览基准测试往往依赖简单的固定工作流程，无法真正测试模型的细粒度视觉推理和多模态理解能力。

Method: 通过 Spatial-Temporal Extrapolation 方法构建 311 项任务，要求模型提取并传播局部视觉信号，并在检索噪声下进行交叉验证。

Result: 最强的模型在无搜索时准确率为 15.1%，搜索后提升至 36.0%，而开源模型 Qwen-2.5-VL-72B-Instruct 在无搜索时准确率为 0.0%，搜索后为 6.9%。

Conclusion: MMSearch-Plus 基准测试揭示了当前多模态语言模型在细粒度视觉推理、长时程工具使用和来源验证方面的不足，即使是表现最好的模型在这些任务上也表现不佳。

Abstract: Large multimodal language models (MLLMs) are increasingly deployed as web
agents, yet many multimodal browsing benchmarks can be solved by shallow, fixed
workflows that lean on high-recall image search and nearby text-masking the
genuinely multimodal challenges of fine-grained visual reasoning, provenance
verification, and long-horizon tool use. We introduce MMSearch-Plus, a
benchmark of 311 tasks that highly demand multimodal understanding while
preserving the difficulty profile of strong text-only browsing suites. Each
item is constructed to contain multiple weak, localized visual signals that
must be extracted, propagated through iterative text-image search, and
cross-validated under retrieval noise before answering. Our curation procedure,
Spatial-Temporal Extrapolation, seeds questions whose answers require
extrapolating from spatial cues (micro-text, part-level appearance, layouts,
signage) and temporal traces (broadcast overlays, seasonal context) to
out-of-image facts such as events, dates, and venues. We provide a
model-agnostic agent framework with browsing tools and evaluate a range of
closed and open MLLMs. The strongest agent (o3) attains 15.1% without search
and 36.0% accuracy with rollout under our framework, while a strong open-source
model (Qwen-2.5-VL-72B-Instruct) achieves 0.0% without search and 6.9% after 20
rounds of search. Beyond answer accuracy, we assess bounding-box production and
cropped-image search, and conduct an error analysis that surfaces failures in
source verification, part-based reasoning, and long-horizon planning.

Conclusion: 该研究通过模糊推理系统和Z数形式化智慧的多维度和不确定性，为心理学测量和AI系统提供了可解释的、基于置信度的推理方法。

Abstract: Background: Wisdom is a superordinate construct that embraces perspective
taking, reflectiveness, prosocial orientation, reflective empathetic action,
and intellectual humility. Unlike conventional models of reasoning that are
rigidly bound by binary thinking, wisdom unfolds in shades of ambiguity,
requiring both graded evaluation and self-reflective humility. Current measures
depend on self-reports and seldom reflect the humility and uncertainty inherent
in wise reasoning. A computational framework that takes into account both
multidimensionality and confidence has the potential to improve psychological
science and allow humane AI. Method: We present a fuzzy inference system with Z
numbers, each of the decisions being expressed in terms of a wisdom score
(restriction) and confidence score (certainty). As part of this study,
participants (N = 100) were exposed to culturally neutral pictorial moral
dilemma tasks to which they generated think-aloud linguistic responses, which
were mapped into five theoretically based components of wisdom. The scores of
each individual component were combined using a base of 21 rules, with
membership functions tuned via Gaussian kernel density estimation. Results: In
a proof of concept study, the system produced dual attribute wisdom
representations that correlated modestly but significantly with established
scales while showing negligible relations with unrelated traits, supporting
convergent and divergent validity. Contribution: The contribution is to
formalize wisdom as a multidimensional, uncertainty-conscious construct,
operationalized in the form of Z-numbers. In addition to progressing
measurement in psychology, it calculates how fuzzy Z numbers can provide AI
systems with interpretable, confidence-sensitive reasoning that affords a safe,
middle ground between rigorous computation and human-like judgment.

Result: 证明生成反事实场景的计算成本通常与规划问题求解相当，展示了方法的实用性。

Conclusion: 该框架为构建实际算法提供了基础，并展示了反事实场景在自动规划中的潜力。

Abstract: Counterfactual Explanations (CEs) are a powerful technique used to explain
Machine Learning models by showing how the input to a model should be minimally
changed for the model to produce a different output. Similar proposals have
been made in the context of Automated Planning, where CEs have been
characterised in terms of minimal modifications to an existing plan that would
result in the satisfaction of a different goal. While such explanations may
help diagnose faults and reason about the characteristics of a plan, they fail
to capture higher-level properties of the problem being solved. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel explanation paradigm that is based on
counterfactual scenarios. In particular, given a planning problem $P$ and an
\ltlf formula $\psi$ defining desired properties of a plan, counterfactual
scenarios identify minimal modifications to $P$ such that it admits plans that
comply with $\psi$. In this paper, we present two qualitative instantiations of
counterfactual scenarios based on an explicit quantification over plans that
must satisfy $\psi$. We then characterise the computational complexity of
generating such counterfactual scenarios when different types of changes are
allowed on $P$. We show that producing counterfactual scenarios is often only
as expensive as computing a plan for $P$, thus demonstrating the practical
viability of our proposal and ultimately providing a framework to construct
practical algorithms in this area.

Abstract: Process mining has emerged as a powerful analytical technique for
understanding complex healthcare workflows. However, its application faces
significant barriers, including technical complexity, a lack of standardized
approaches, and limited access to practical training resources. We introduce
HealthProcessAI, a GenAI framework designed to simplify process mining
applications in healthcare and epidemiology by providing a comprehensive
wrapper around existing Python (PM4PY) and R (bupaR) libraries. To address
unfamiliarity and improve accessibility, the framework integrates multiple
Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated process map interpretation and
report generation, helping translate technical analyses into outputs that
diverse users can readily understand. We validated the framework using sepsis
progression data as a proof-of-concept example and compared the outputs of five
state-of-the-art LLM models through the OpenRouter platform. To test its
functionality, the framework successfully processed sepsis data across four
proof-of-concept scenarios, demonstrating robust technical performance and its
capability to generate reports through automated LLM analysis. LLM evaluation
using five independent LLMs as automated evaluators revealed distinct model
strengths: Claude Sonnet-4 and Gemini 2.5-Pro achieved the highest consistency
scores (3.79/4.0 and 3.65/4.0) when evaluated by automated LLM assessors. By
integrating multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated interpretation
and report generation, the framework addresses widespread unfamiliarity with
process mining outputs, making them more accessible to clinicians, data
scientists, and researchers. This structured analytics and AI-driven
interpretation combination represents a novel methodological advance in
translating complex process mining results into potentially actionable insights
for healthcare applications.

Conclusion: 通用地标不仅能捕捉可解释的领域信息，还能通过少量计划实例发现，对自动规划器非常有用。

Abstract: We propose a new framework for discovering landmarks that automatically
generalize across a domain. These generalized landmarks are learned from a set
of solved instances and describe intermediate goals for planning problems where
traditional landmark extraction algorithms fall short. Our generalized
landmarks extend beyond the predicates of a domain by using state functions
that are independent of the objects of a specific problem and apply to all
similar objects, thus capturing repetition. Based on these functions, we
construct a directed generalized landmark graph that defines the landmark
progression, including loop possibilities for repetitive subplans. We show how
to use this graph in a heuristic to solve new problem instances of the same
domain. Our results show that the generalized landmark graphs learned from a
few small instances are also effective for larger instances in the same domain.
If a loop that indicates repetition is identified, we see a significant
improvement in heuristic performance over the baseline. Generalized landmarks
capture domain information that is interpretable and useful to an automated
planner. This information can be discovered from a small set of plans for the
same domain.

Method: 论文提出了IDPP方法，基于经典的联合均衡搜索框架，专门优化处理Det-Dec-POMDPs。

Result: IDPP能够高效解决大规模Det-Dec-POMDPs问题，而现有方法难以应对。

Conclusion: Det-Dec-POMDPs和IDPP为解决多智能体规划问题提供了新的理论和实践工具。

Abstract: Many high-level multi-agent planning problems, including multi-robot
navigation and path planning, can be effectively modeled using deterministic
actions and observations.
  In this work, we focus on such domains and introduce the class of
Deterministic Decentralized POMDPs (Det-Dec-POMDPs). This is a subclass of
Dec-POMDPs characterized by deterministic transitions and observations
conditioned on the state and joint actions.
  We then propose a practical solver called Iterative Deterministic POMDP
Planning (IDPP). This method builds on the classic Joint Equilibrium Search for
Policies framework and is specifically optimized to handle large-scale
Det-Dec-POMDPs that current Dec-POMDP solvers are unable to address
efficiently.

TL;DR: 结合网络优化与LLMs的框架，提供交互式供应链决策支持，案例验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决复杂运筹学输出与业务利益相关者理解之间的差距，提升供应链规划的效率和透明度。

Method: 结合混合整数规划的核心优化模型与LLMs生成自然语言摘要、可视化内容和定制化KPIs，通过AI代理、RESTful API和动态用户界面实现实时交互。

Result: 案例研究表明，该系统在避免缺货、降低成本和服务水平维持方面显著改善了规划效果。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的集成框架通过结合传统网络优化模型与大型语言模型（LLMs），为供应链规划提供了交互式、可解释且角色感知的决策支持系统。未来将整合更多技术（如私有LLMs、强化学习等）以进一步提升系统的可解释性和实时决策能力。

Abstract: This paper presents an integrated framework that combines traditional network
optimization models with large language models (LLMs) to deliver interactive,
explainable, and role-aware decision support for supply chain planning. The
proposed system bridges the gap between complex operations research outputs and
business stakeholder understanding by generating natural language summaries,
contextual visualizations, and tailored key performance indicators (KPIs). The
core optimization model addresses tactical inventory redistribution across a
network of distribution centers for multi-period and multi-item, using a
mixed-integer formulation. The technical architecture incorporates AI agents,
RESTful APIs, and a dynamic user interface to support real-time interaction,
configuration updates, and simulation-based insights. A case study demonstrates
how the system improves planning outcomes by preventing stockouts, reducing
costs, and maintaining service levels. Future extensions include integrating
private LLMs, transfer learning, reinforcement learning, and Bayesian neural
networks to enhance explainability, adaptability, and real-time
decision-making.

*Ramkumar Natarajan,Muhammad Suhail Saleem,William Xiao,Sandip Aine,Howie Choset,Maxim Likhachev*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究提出A-MHA*算法，扩展MHA*为Anytime版本，实现在有限时间内持续优化解的能力，并在多个领域验证了其性能优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MHA*算法虽然能利用多个部分优良但不可容许的启发式函数加速搜索，但无法在运行过程中持续改进解的质量。

Method: 研究将ARA*的概念精确应用于MHA*框架中，使其具备在运行时间内持续优化解的能力。

Result: A-MHA*不仅保留了MHA*的次优解和完备性保证，还在实际应用中表现出优于MHA*及其他Anytime算法的性能。

Conclusion: 研究通过扩展MHA*算法，开发了A-MHA*，使其能够在有限时间内不断改进解的质量，并在3D路径规划和滑动拼图等领域中验证了其性能提升。

Abstract: Designing good heuristic functions for graph search requires adequate domain
knowledge. It is often easy to design heuristics that perform well and
correlate with the underlying true cost-to-go values in certain parts of the
search space but these may not be admissible throughout the domain thereby
affecting the optimality guarantees of the search. Bounded suboptimal search
using several such partially good but inadmissible heuristics was developed in
Multi-Heuristic A* (MHA*). Although MHA* leverages multiple inadmissible
heuristics to potentially generate a faster suboptimal solution, the original
version does not improve the solution over time. It is a one shot algorithm
that requires careful setting of inflation factors to obtain a desired one time
solution. In this work, we tackle this issue by extending MHA* to an anytime
version that finds a feasible suboptimal solution quickly and continually
improves it until time runs out. Our work is inspired from the Anytime
Repairing A* (ARA*) algorithm. We prove that our precise adaptation of ARA*
concepts in the MHA* framework preserves the original suboptimal and
completeness guarantees and enhances MHA* to perform in an anytime fashion.
Furthermore, we report the performance of A-MHA* in 3-D path planning domain
and sliding tiles puzzle and compare against MHA* and other anytime algorithms.

*Farhad Abtahi,Mehdi Astaraki,Fernando Seoane*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MEDLEY框架通过保留AI模型的多样性和偏见，提升了医学推理的透明度和临床监督，为AI系统的发展提供了新思路。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的医学AI方法试图消除偏见，但人类推理本身依赖于偏见，因此探索如何利用这些多样性可能更具价值。

Method: 提出MEDLEY框架，通过集成多个AI模型并保留其多样性输出，同时将模型的偏见和幻觉视为潜在资源。

Result: 开发了一个概念验证演示器，展示了如何通过保留共识和少数观点来增强医学推理的透明度和临床监督。

Conclusion: MEDLEY通过保留多样性和框架化AI的不足，为医学AI系统的发展提供了新的监管、伦理和创新途径。

Abstract: Bias in medical artificial intelligence is conventionally viewed as a defect
requiring elimination. However, human reasoning inherently incorporates biases
shaped by education, culture, and experience, suggesting their presence may be
inevitable and potentially valuable. We propose MEDLEY (Medical Ensemble
Diagnostic system with Leveraged diversitY), a conceptual framework that
orchestrates multiple AI models while preserving their diverse outputs rather
than collapsing them into a consensus. Unlike traditional approaches that
suppress disagreement, MEDLEY documents model-specific biases as potential
strengths and treats hallucinations as provisional hypotheses for clinician
verification. A proof-of-concept demonstrator was developed using over 30 large
language models, creating a minimum viable product that preserved both
consensus and minority views in synthetic cases, making diagnostic uncertainty
and latent biases transparent for clinical oversight. While not yet a validated
clinical tool, the demonstration illustrates how structured diversity can
enhance medical reasoning under clinician supervision. By reframing AI
imperfection as a resource, MEDLEY offers a paradigm shift that opens new
regulatory, ethical, and innovation pathways for developing trustworthy medical
AI systems.

TL;DR: PosterForest是一种无需训练的科学海报生成框架，通过层次化表示和多智能体协作，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法忽视科学文档层次结构和图文语义整合的问题。

Method: 采用Poster Tree作为层次化中间表示，结合多智能体协作策略，优化内容摘要和布局规划。

Result: 在多个学术领域的实验中，PosterForest在质量和用户偏好上均优于基线，信息保存和结构清晰度表现突出。

Conclusion: PosterForest框架通过引入Poster Tree表示和智能体协作策略，显著提升了科学海报生成的逻辑一致性、内容保真度和视觉连贯性，其效果接近专家设计水平。

Abstract: We present a novel training-free framework, \textit{PosterForest}, for
automated scientific poster generation. Unlike prior approaches, which largely
neglect the hierarchical structure of scientific documents and the semantic
integration of textual and visual elements, our method addresses both
challenges directly. We introduce the \textit{Poster Tree}, a hierarchical
intermediate representation that jointly encodes document structure and
visual-textual relationships at multiple levels. Our framework employs a
multi-agent collaboration strategy, where agents specializing in content
summarization and layout planning iteratively coordinate and provide mutual
feedback. This approach enables the joint optimization of logical consistency,
content fidelity, and visual coherence. Extensive experiments on multiple
academic domains show that our method outperforms existing baselines in both
qualitative and quantitative evaluations. The resulting posters achieve quality
closest to expert-designed ground truth and deliver superior information
preservation, structural clarity, and user preference.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种变分算法，通过冻结优化的电路结构处理TSP问题，在中小规模实例中表现优异，但7城市时性能显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决TSP问题时，减少量子比特需求和优化算法的运行时间是关键挑战。通过冻结电路结构和复用优化的拓扑，可以显著降低测试时的结构研究成本，使其适用于NISQ硬件。

Method: 提出了一个结合紧凑排列编码和优化-冻结-重用策略的变分算法，首先通过模拟退火优化电路拓扑，然后冻结并复用该结构，仅重新优化电路参数。

Result: 在4-7个城市的随机对称实例中，算法在4、5、6城市上的平均最优路径采样概率分别为100%、90%和80%，但在7城市时降至20%，显示了规模扩展的局限性。

Conclusion: 该论文展示了变分算法在处理TSP问题时的潜力，但也揭示了其在规模扩大时的局限性。通过冻结Ansatz结构，算法在保持解质量的同时显著减少了求解时间。未来的研究方向包括扩展到更复杂的问题（如车辆路径和作业车间调度）。

Abstract: In this paper we present a variational algorithm for the Traveling Salesman
Problem (TSP) that combines (i) a compact encoding of permutations, which
reduces the qubit requirement too, (ii) an optimize-freeze-reuse strategy:
where the circuit topology (``Ansatz'') is first optimized on a training
instance by Simulated Annealing (SA), then ``frozen'' and re-used on novel
instances, limited to a rapid re-optimization of only the circuit parameters.
This pipeline eliminates costly structural research in testing, making the
procedure immediately implementable on NISQ hardware.
  On a set of $40$ randomly generated symmetric instances that span $4 - 7$
cities, the resulting Ansatz achieves an average optimal trip sampling
probability of $100\%$ for 4 city cases, $90\%$ for 5 city cases and $80\%$ for
6 city cases. With 7 cities the success rate drops markedly to an average of
$\sim 20\%$, revealing the onset of scalability limitations of the proposed
method.
  The results show robust generalization ability for moderate problem sizes and
indicate how freezing the Ansatz can dramatically reduce time-to-solution
without degrading solution quality. The paper also discusses scalability
limitations, the impact of ``warm-start'' initialization of parameters, and
prospects for extension to more complex problems, such as Vehicle Routing and
Job-Shop Scheduling.

Motivation: 时间序列分析中理解时间变量之间的因果关系是一个核心挑战，尤其是在完整因果结构未知的情况下。

Method: 提出了在给定摘要因果图背景知识和忠实因果充分分布的情况下，保证微观层面时间变量边可定向的条件。

Result: 研究结果为微观层面的边定向提供了理论保证，即使在宏观层面存在循环或双向边的情况下。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了在复杂时间系统中利用专家知识提供的摘要因果图（SCG）指导微观层面因果发现的实用性，尤其是在宏观层面存在循环或双向边的情况下。

Abstract: Understanding causal relations between temporal variables is a central
challenge in time series analysis, particularly when the full causal structure
is unknown. Even when the full causal structure cannot be fully specified,
experts often succeed in providing a high-level abstraction of the causal
graph, known as a summary causal graph, which captures the main causal
relations between different time series while abstracting away micro-level
details. In this work, we present conditions that guarantee the orientability
of micro-level edges between temporal variables given the background knowledge
encoded in a summary causal graph and assuming having access to a faithful and
causally sufficient distribution with respect to the true unknown graph. Our
results provide theoretical guarantees for edge orientation at the micro-level,
even in the presence of cycles or bidirected edges at the macro-level. These
findings offer practical guidance for leveraging SCGs to inform causal
discovery in complex temporal systems and highlight the value of incorporating
expert knowledge to improve causal inference from observational time series
data.

TL;DR: 树引导扩散规划器（TDP）是一种零样本测试时规划框架，通过结构化轨迹生成平衡探索与利用，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准梯度引导在非凸、非可微和多奖励结构的现实场景中效果有限，现有监督规划方法缺乏测试时灵活性和零样本泛化能力。

Method: TDP通过双层采样过程（多样父轨迹生成和快速条件去噪子轨迹优化）进行树搜索规划，仅依赖预训练模型和任务目标信号。

Result: TDP在迷宫拾金、机械臂操控和AntMaze多目标探索任务中均优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: TDP通过树引导扩散规划解决了梯度引导的局限性，展示了强大的零样本测试时规划能力。

Abstract: Planning with pretrained diffusion models has emerged as a promising approach
for solving test-time guided control problems. However, standard gradient
guidance typically performs optimally under convex and differentiable reward
landscapes, showing substantially reduced effectiveness in real-world scenarios
involving non-convex objectives, non-differentiable constraints, and
multi-reward structures. Furthermore, recent supervised planning approaches
require task-specific training or value estimators, which limits test-time
flexibility and zero-shot generalization. We propose a Tree-guided Diffusion
Planner (TDP), a zero-shot test-time planning framework that balances
exploration and exploitation through structured trajectory generation. We frame
test-time planning as a tree search problem using a bi-level sampling process:
(1) diverse parent trajectories are produced via training-free particle
guidance to encourage broad exploration, and (2) sub-trajectories are refined
through fast conditional denoising guided by task objectives. TDP addresses the
limitations of gradient guidance by exploring diverse trajectory regions and
harnessing gradient information across this expanded solution space using only
pretrained models and test-time reward signals. We evaluate TDP on three
diverse tasks: maze gold-picking, robot arm block manipulation, and AntMaze
multi-goal exploration. TDP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches on all tasks. The project page can be found at:

TL;DR: 提出了一种模拟临床团队的多代理系统，显著提升了临床问题识别的准确性和稳健性，但需注意群体思维的潜在影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床叙事解释的准确性对患者护理至关重要，但现有自动化方法（如单一大型语言模型）在高风险临床任务中缺乏稳健性。

Method: 引入了一个协作的多代理系统（MAS），该系统模拟临床咨询团队，通过分析SOAP笔记中的主观（S）和客观（O）部分来识别临床问题。系统由一个管理代理动态分配专家代理团队，进行分层、迭代的辩论以达成共识。

Result: 在420个MIMIC-III笔记的精选数据集上评估表明，动态多代理配置在识别充血性心力衰竭、急性肾损伤和脓毒症方面表现更优，但偶尔会受到群体思维的影响。

Conclusion: 通过模拟临床团队的推理过程，该系统为更准确、稳健和可解释的临床决策支持工具提供了一条有希望的途径。

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of clinical narratives is critical for patient care,
but the complexity of these notes makes automation challenging. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) show promise, single-model approaches can lack the
robustness required for high-stakes clinical tasks. We introduce a
collaborative multi-agent system (MAS) that models a clinical consultation team
to address this gap. The system is tasked with identifying clinical problems by
analyzing only the Subjective (S) and Objective (O) sections of SOAP notes,
simulating the diagnostic reasoning process of synthesizing raw data into an
assessment. A Manager agent orchestrates a dynamically assigned team of
specialist agents who engage in a hierarchical, iterative debate to reach a
consensus. We evaluated our MAS against a single-agent baseline on a curated
dataset of 420 MIMIC-III notes. The dynamic multi-agent configuration
demonstrated consistently improved performance in identifying congestive heart
failure, acute kidney injury, and sepsis. Qualitative analysis of the agent
debates reveals that this structure effectively surfaces and weighs conflicting
evidence, though it can occasionally be susceptible to groupthink. By modeling
a clinical team's reasoning process, our system offers a promising path toward
more accurate, robust, and interpretable clinical decision support tools.

Motivation: 三维有限元模拟在心血管血流预测中计算成本高，难以临床应用；现有的降阶模型（ROMs）虽然计算效率高，但在分岔处精度不足。论文旨在通过机器学习增强ROMs的精度，同时保持计算效率。

Method: 论文开发了一种电阻-电阻-电感（RRI）模型，利用神经网络从分岔几何形状预测压力-流量关系，并结合了线性/非线性电阻和电感效应。通过非量纲化和先验流量分割预测，减少了训练数据需求并优化了分岔特征描述。该方法通过基于优化的解决方案将RRI模型集成到0D模型中。

Result: 验证结果表明，RRI方法将标准0D模型的入口压力误差从54 mmHg（45%）降至25 mmHg（17%），而简化版的电阻-电感（RI）模型误差为31 mmHg（26%）。该方法在高雷诺数和复杂血管网络中表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的混合数值方法通过将机器学习预测的分岔系数集成到零维血流动力学模型中，显著提高了准确性，同时保持了计算效率，为临床决策支持、不确定性量化和心血管生物医学工程中的数字孪生提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) finite-element simulations of cardiovascular flows
provide high-fidelity predictions to support cardiovascular medicine, but their
high computational cost limits clinical practicality. Reduced-order models
(ROMs) offer computationally efficient alternatives but suffer reduced
accuracy, particularly at vessel bifurcations where complex flow physics are
inadequately captured by standard Poiseuille flow assumptions. We present an
enhanced numerical framework that integrates machine learning-predicted
bifurcation coefficients into zero-dimensional (0D) hemodynamic ROMs to improve
accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. We develop a
resistor-resistor-inductor (RRI) model that uses neural networks to predict
pressure-flow relationships from bifurcation geometry, incorporating linear and
quadratic resistances along with inductive effects. The method employs
non-dimensionalization to reduce training data requirements and apriori flow
split prediction for improved bifurcation characterization. We incorporate the
RRI model into a 0D model using an optimization-based solution strategy. We
validate the approach in isolated bifurcations and vascular trees, across
Reynolds numbers from 0 to 5,500, defining ROM accuracy by comparison to 3D
finite element simulation. Results demonstrate substantial accuracy
improvements: averaged across all trees and Reynolds numbers, the RRI method
reduces inlet pressure errors from 54 mmHg (45%) for standard 0D models to 25
mmHg (17%), while a simplified resistor-inductor (RI) variant achieves 31 mmHg
(26%) error. The enhanced 0D models show particular effectiveness at high
Reynolds numbers and in extensive vascular networks. This hybrid numerical
approach enables accurate, real-time hemodynamic modeling for clinical decision
support, uncertainty quantification, and digital twins in cardiovascular
biomedical engineering.

Abstract: In a recent work, we proposed a graph-based manifold learning scheme for the
nonlinear Galerkin-reduction of quasi-static solid mechanical problems [1]. The
resulting nonlinear approximation spaces can closely and flexibly represent
nonlinear solution manifolds. The present work discusses how this nonlinear
model order reduction (MOR) approach can be employed to reduce online
computational costs by multiple orders of magnitude while retaining high levels
of accuracy. We integrate two popular hyperreduction methods into the nonlinear
MOR framework and discuss how we achieve an algorithmic complexity which is
independent from the original system size. Furthermore, improvements are made
to the local online linearisation scheme for the sake of performance and
robustness. On an example RVE problem, the MOR scheme accelerates computations
by more than two orders of magnitude with little training data and negligible
loss of accuracy. Additionally, the algorithm Pareto-dominates alternative
approaches in the trade-off between accuracy and runtime on the considered
example.

Abstract: Architected materials of significant geometric complexity offer exceptional
mechanical properties that often surpass those of their constituent materials.
However, their fabrication through extrusion-based 3D printing remains hindered
by suboptimal printing trajectories, which is inherent to commercial slicing
software. They produce multiple non-continuous paths that compromise
fabrication time, shape fidelity, and structural integrity, particularly for
thin-walled lattice structures. To address this issue, we introduce GIPPO
(Graph-based, Iterative, Printing-Path Optimization), an open-source slicing
platform that transforms complex lattice designs into optimized printing
trajectories. Lattices are converted to graph networks to derive the optimal
printing trajectories through a modified version of Prim's algorithm. The
resulting paths are translated back to Euclidean coordinates and exported as a
ready-to-use G-code. We validated GIPPO's performance against conventional
slicing software across six architected lattice geometries fabricated from
thermoplastic polyurethane using fused deposition modeling. GIPPO-optimized
constructs demonstrated superior shape fidelity with reduced local thickness
deviations, no missing struts, and minimized excess material deposition
compared to conventionally printed controls. Mechanical testing revealed that
printing path optimization directly influences both uniaxial and out-of-plane
mechanical responses, with different optimization strategies yielding distinct
performance characteristics suited to specific loading conditions. Moreover,
the platform accommodates both planar and non-planar printing geometries and
enables fabrication of objects with varying infill patterns per layer. Our work
addresses critical limitations in commercial slicing software and opens new
opportunities for high-fidelity fabrication of complex architected materials.
