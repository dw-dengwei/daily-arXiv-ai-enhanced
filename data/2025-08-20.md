### [1] [YOLO11-CR: a Lightweight Convolution-and-Attention Framework for Accurate Fatigue Driving Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13205)
*Zhebin Jin,Ligang Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight YOLO-based fatigue detector (YOLO11-CR) with CAFM and RCM modules achieves strong real-time performance for in-vehicle fatigue monitoring, validated on DSM data with ablation confirming module effectiveness; future work includes temporal modeling and multi-modal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Driver fatigue detection is crucial for road safety. Vision-based methods are non-intrusive and scalable but face challenges with small/occluded objects and multi-scale features; there is a need for real-time, accurate, and robust detection suitable for in-vehicle deployment.

Method: Proposes YOLO11-CR, a lightweight object detector integrating Convolution-and-Attention Fusion Module (CAFM) to merge local CNN features with global Transformer context, and Rectangular Calibration Module (RCM) to capture horizontal/vertical contextual cues for better localization of profile faces and small objects, aiming for real-time fatigue detection.

Result: On the DSM dataset, achieves precision 87.17%, recall 83.86%, mAP@50 88.09%, and mAP@50-95 55.93%, outperforming baselines. Ablation studies show CAFM and RCM improve sensitivity and localization accuracy.

Conclusion: YOLO11-CR offers a practical, high-performing solution for in-vehicle fatigue monitoring with strong potential for real-world deployment; future enhancements include temporal modeling, multi-modal data integration, and embedded optimization.

Abstract: Driver fatigue detection is of paramount importance for intelligent
transportation systems due to its critical role in mitigating road traffic
accidents. While physiological and vehicle dynamics-based methods offer
accuracy, they are often intrusive, hardware-dependent, and lack robustness in
real-world environments. Vision-based techniques provide a non-intrusive and
scalable alternative, but still face challenges such as poor detection of small
or occluded objects and limited multi-scale feature modeling. To address these
issues, this paper proposes YOLO11-CR, a lightweight and efficient object
detection model tailored for real-time fatigue detection. YOLO11-CR introduces
two key modules: the Convolution-and-Attention Fusion Module (CAFM), which
integrates local CNN features with global Transformer-based context to enhance
feature expressiveness; and the Rectangular Calibration Module (RCM), which
captures horizontal and vertical contextual information to improve spatial
localization, particularly for profile faces and small objects like mobile
phones. Experiments on the DSM dataset demonstrated that YOLO11-CR achieves a
precision of 87.17%, recall of 83.86%, mAP@50 of 88.09%, and mAP@50-95 of
55.93%, outperforming baseline models significantly. Ablation studies further
validate the effectiveness of the CAFM and RCM modules in improving both
sensitivity and localization accuracy. These results demonstrate that YOLO11-CR
offers a practical and high-performing solution for in-vehicle fatigue
monitoring, with strong potential for real-world deployment and future
enhancements involving temporal modeling, multi-modal data integration, and
embedded optimization.

### [2] [MIRAGE: Towards AI-Generated Image Detection in the Wild](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13223)
*Cheng Xia,Manxi Lin,Jiexiang Tan,Xiaoxiong Du,Yang Qiu,Junjun Zheng,Xiangheng Kong,Yuning Jiang,Bo Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces Mirage, a new in-the-wild AIGI detection benchmark and Mirage-R1, a vision-language model with reflective reasoning for detection, trained via supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, with adaptive inference. achieves state-of-the-art results on Mirage and public benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In-the-wild AIGI detection is challenging due to noisy real-world images and the gap between lab-evaluated detectors and real-world data. A robust benchmark and advanced reasoning-based detector are needed to improve reliability and trust.

Method: Construct Mirage from internet-sourced, expert-verified AIGI samples and a synthesized dataset from collaborative expert generators to simulate realistic, diverse in-the-wild scenarios. Develop Mirage-R1, a vision-language model that employs heuristic-to-analytic reasoning and reflective reasoning. Train in two stages: supervised fine-tuning for cold start, followed by reinforcement learning; apply an inference-time adaptive thinking strategy to switch between quick judgments and robust conclusions.

Result: Mirage-R1 achieves 5% improvement over state-of-the-art detectors on Mirage and 10% on the public benchmark. The Mirage benchmark and code will be publicly released.

Conclusion: The proposed Mirage benchmark and Mirage-R1 detector advance in-the-wild AIGI detection, offering improved accuracy and a scalable evaluation framework for real-world misinformation safeguards.

Abstract: The spreading of AI-generated images (AIGI), driven by advances in generative
AI, poses a significant threat to information security and public trust.
Existing AIGI detectors, while effective against images in clean laboratory
settings, fail to generalize to in-the-wild scenarios. These real-world images
are noisy, varying from ``obviously fake" images to realistic ones derived from
multiple generative models and further edited for quality control. We address
in-the-wild AIGI detection in this paper. We introduce Mirage, a challenging
benchmark designed to emulate the complexity of in-the-wild AIGI. Mirage is
constructed from two sources: (1) a large corpus of Internet-sourced AIGI
verified by human experts, and (2) a synthesized dataset created through the
collaboration between multiple expert generators, closely simulating the
realistic AIGI in the wild. Building on this benchmark, we propose Mirage-R1, a
vision-language model with heuristic-to-analytic reasoning, a reflective
reasoning mechanism for AIGI detection. Mirage-R1 is trained in two stages: a
supervised-fine-tuning cold start, followed by a reinforcement learning stage.
By further adopting an inference-time adaptive thinking strategy, Mirage-R1 is
able to provide either a quick judgment or a more robust and accurate
conclusion, effectively balancing inference speed and performance. Extensive
experiments show that our model leads state-of-the-art detectors by 5% and 10%
on Mirage and the public benchmark, respectively. The benchmark and code will
be made publicly available.

### [3] [Uncertainty-Aware Learning Policy for Reliable Pulmonary Nodule Detection on Chest X-Ray](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13236)
*Hyeonjin Choi,Jinse Kim,Dong-yeon Yoo,Ju-sung Sun,Jung-won Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Uncertainty-aware learning combines physicians' background knowledge with chest X-ray lesion data to improve lung nodule diagnosis and reduce diagnostic uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Physician interpretation of chest X-rays varies with experience and fatigue. AI-based diagnosis faces mistrust due to predictive uncertainty and lack of integration of clinical background knowledge.

Method: Proposes an Uncertainty-Aware Learning Policy that jointly learns physicians' background knowledge and chest X-ray lesion information. Uses dataset of 2,517 lesion-free images and 656 nodule images from Ajou University Hospital.

Result: Achieves 92% IoU at IoU 0.2 and FPPI 2, with a 10% increase in sensitivity over a baseline model and a reduction of entropy by 0.2 (uncertainty).

Conclusion: Incorporating physician-like background knowledge into AI models can reduce diagnostic uncertainty and improve trust and performance in chest X-ray lesion diagnosis.

Abstract: Early detection and rapid intervention of lung cancer are crucial.
Nonetheless, ensuring an accurate diagnosis is challenging, as physicians'
ability to interpret chest X-rays varies significantly depending on their
experience and degree of fatigue. Although medical AI has been rapidly
advancing to assist in diagnosis, physicians' trust in such systems remains
limited, preventing widespread clinical adoption. This skepticism fundamentally
stems from concerns about its diagnostic uncertainty. In clinical diagnosis,
physicians utilize extensive background knowledge and clinical experience. In
contrast, medical AI primarily relies on repetitive learning of the target
lesion to generate diagnoses based solely on that data. In other words, medical
AI does not possess sufficient knowledge to render a diagnosis, leading to
diagnostic uncertainty. Thus, this study suggests an Uncertainty-Aware Learning
Policy that can address the issue of knowledge deficiency by learning the
physicians' background knowledge alongside the Chest X-ray lesion information.
We used 2,517 lesion-free images and 656 nodule images, all obtained from Ajou
University Hospital. The proposed model attained 92% (IoU 0.2 / FPPI 2) with a
10% enhancement in sensitivity compared to the baseline model while also
decreasing entropy as a measure of uncertainty by 0.2.

### [4] [DianJin-OCR-R1: Enhancing OCR Capabilities via a Reasoning-and-Tool Interleaved Vision-Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13238)
*Qian Chen,Xianyin Zhang,Lifan Guo,Feng Chen,Chi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A reasoning-enhanced LVLM for OCR, DianJin-OCR-R1, interleaves self-recognition with calls to expert OCR tools to reduce hallucinations and improve task-specific accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs suffer hallucinations and underperform on OCR tasks compared to expert models; need a framework that leverages domain-specific tools while maintaining end-to-end reasoning.

Method: Propose DianJin-OCR-R1 that first uses its own OCR to recognize content, then calls external expert models/tools to obtain references, then re-evaluates with image and final reasoning to output results. Uses tool interleaving and iterative reasoning, enabling smaller expert models to contribute. Evaluations on ReST and OmniDocBench.

Result: Consistent improvements over non-reasoning baselines and comparable or better than expert OCR models; reduced hallucinations and improved OCR performance.

Conclusion: Reasoning-and-tool interleaving in LVLMs enhances OCR accuracy and robustness; leveraging domain-specific tools makes LVLMs cheaper and more reliable for document parsing tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have enabled a new
paradigm of end-to-end document image parsing, excelling in Optical Character
Recognition (OCR) tasks such as text, table, and formula recognition. However,
generative LVLMs, similarly to large language models (LLMs), are prone to
hallucinations--generating words that do not exist in input images.
Furthermore, LVLMs are designed for general purposes and tend to be less
effective on OCR tasks compared to expert models that are trained on
domain-specific datasets. In this paper, we propose DianJin-OCR-R1, a
reasoning-enhanced framework designed to address these limitations through
training reasoning-and-tool interleaved VLMs. Given a recognition instruction,
our DianJin-OCR-R1 model first recognizes the content in the input image by its
own OCR capabilities, and then calls other tools (i.e., other expert models) to
obtain their results as references, finally looks again the image and rethinks
about the reasoning process to provide the final recognized content. Since
architectures of expert models are tailored for specific OCR tasks, which makes
them less prone to hallucinations, their results can help VLMs mitigate
hallucinations. Additionally, expert models are typically smaller in scale and
easy to iterate, enabling performance improvements for VLMs at a lower cost. We
evaluate our model on ReST and OmniDocBench, and experimental results show that
our DianJin-OCR-R1 models consistently outperform their non-reasoning
counterparts and expert OCR models, which proves the effectiveness of our
method.

### [5] [Exploration of Deep Learning Based Recognition for Urdu Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13245)
*Sumaiya Fazal,Sheeraz Ahmed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A CNN-based, component-wise Urdu OCR framework using permutation-generated data and CC-based ligature extraction, implemented as a two-level hierarchical network; reports 0.99% component classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urdu OCR is hampered by context sensitivity and difficult segmentation; segmentation-based recognition yields high error. A component-based, segmentation-free approach leveraging CNNs could improve accuracy, especially for ligatures.

Method: Generate Urdu-like dataset by permuting three-character sequences; filter to ligatures using connected components; train/test a two-level hierarchical CNN for component and ligature classification.

Result: Achieves 0.99% accuracy for component classification on the constructed dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed hierarchical CNN component-based approach shows promise for Urdu OCR by reducing reliance on segmentation and focusing on component-level discrimination; further work needed to validate on real data and larger vocabulary.

Abstract: Urdu is a cursive script language and has similarities with Arabic and many
other South Asian languages. Urdu is difficult to classify due to its complex
geometrical and morphological structure. Character classification can be
processed further if segmentation technique is efficient, but due to context
sensitivity in Urdu, segmentation-based recognition often results with high
error rate. Our proposed approach for Urdu optical character recognition system
is a component-based classification relying on automatic feature learning
technique called convolutional neural network. CNN is trained and tested on
Urdu text dataset, which is generated through permutation process of three
characters and further proceeds to discarding unnecessary images by applying
connected component technique in order to obtain ligature only. Hierarchical
neural network is implemented with two levels to deal with three degrees of
character permutations and component classification Our model successfully
achieved 0.99% for component classification.

### [6] [CLoE: Curriculum Learning on Endoscopic Images for Robust MES Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13280)
*Zeynep Ozdemir,Hacer Yalim Keles,Omer Ozgur Tanriover*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A curriculum learning framework (CLoE) uses image-quality-based difficulty ordering and ResizeMix to improve MES ordinal classification for ulcerative colitis on LIMUC and HyperKvasir, outperforming baselines with CNNs/Transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MES grading for ulcerative colitis is limited by label noise from inter-observer variability and the ordinal nature of scores; there is a need for methods that account for label reliability and ordinal structure.

Method: CLoE orders training samples by estimated annotation confidence via an image-quality proxy derived from a lightweight BBPS-trained model; combines with ResizeMix augmentation; evaluated with CNNs and Transformers on LIMUC and HyperKvasir; uses accuracy and Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) as metrics.

Result: Consistent performance gains over strong supervised and self-supervised baselines; ConvNeXt-Tiny achieves 82.5% accuracy and QWK 0.894 on LIMUC with low computational cost; demonstrates robustness and cross-dataset effectiveness.

Conclusion: Difficulty-aware curriculum learning that accounts for label reliability and ordinal targets can improve ordinal classification under label uncertainty, with practical impact and potential for open-source adoption.

Abstract: Estimating disease severity from endoscopic images is essential in assessing
ulcerative colitis, where the Mayo Endoscopic Subscore (MES) is widely used to
grade inflammation. However, MES classification remains challenging due to
label noise from inter-observer variability and the ordinal nature of the
score, which standard models often ignore. We propose CLoE, a curriculum
learning framework that accounts for both label reliability and ordinal
structure. Image quality, estimated via a lightweight model trained on Boston
Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS) labels, is used as a proxy for annotation
confidence to order samples from easy (clean) to hard (noisy). This curriculum
is further combined with ResizeMix augmentation to improve robustness.
Experiments on the LIMUC and HyperKvasir datasets, using both CNNs and
Transformers, show that CLoE consistently improves performance over strong
supervised and self-supervised baselines. For instance, ConvNeXt-Tiny reaches
82.5\% accuracy and a QWK of 0.894 on LIMUC with low computational cost. These
results highlight the potential of difficulty-aware training strategies for
improving ordinal classification under label uncertainty. Code will be released
at https://github.com/zeynepozdemir/CLoE.

### [7] [GaitCrafter: Diffusion Model for Biometric Preserving Gait Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13300)
*Sirshapan Mitra,Yogesh S. Rawat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion-based framework (GaitCrafter) to synthesize realistic, controllable gait silhouette sequences from scratch, boosting gait recognition and enabling privacy-preserving, novel identities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of large-scale labeled gait datasets and privacy concerns by generating diverse, privacy-preserving gait data.

Method: Train a video diffusion model from scratch on gait silhouette data; generate temporally coherent, identity-preserving sequences; condition on covariates (clothing, carried objects, view angle); interpolate identity embeddings to produce novel synthetic identities.

Result: Synthetic gait data improves gait recognition performance, especially in challenging conditions; novel identities exhibit consistent gait patterns and are useful for training while protecting real subjects' privacy.

Conclusion: Diffusion-based gait synthesis is a promising, controllable, privacy-aware approach for augmenting gait datasets and training robust recognizers.

Abstract: Gait recognition is a valuable biometric task that enables the identification
of individuals from a distance based on their walking patterns. However, it
remains limited by the lack of large-scale labeled datasets and the difficulty
of collecting diverse gait samples for each individual while preserving
privacy. To address these challenges, we propose GaitCrafter, a diffusion-based
framework for synthesizing realistic gait sequences in the silhouette domain.
Unlike prior works that rely on simulated environments or alternative
generative models, GaitCrafter trains a video diffusion model from scratch,
exclusively on gait silhouette data. Our approach enables the generation of
temporally consistent and identity-preserving gait sequences. Moreover, the
generation process is controllable-allowing conditioning on various covariates
such as clothing, carried objects, and view angle. We show that incorporating
synthetic samples generated by GaitCrafter into the gait recognition pipeline
leads to improved performance, especially under challenging conditions.
Additionally, we introduce a mechanism to generate novel identities-synthetic
individuals not present in the original dataset-by interpolating identity
embeddings. These novel identities exhibit unique, consistent gait patterns and
are useful for training models while maintaining privacy of real subjects.
Overall, our work takes an important step toward leveraging diffusion models
for high-quality, controllable, and privacy-aware gait data generation.

### [8] [Prune2Drive: A Plug-and-Play Framework for Accelerating Vision-Language Models in Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13305)
*Minhao Xiong,Zichen Wen,Zhuangcheng Gu,Xuyang Liu,Rui Zhang,Hengrui Kang,Jiabing Yang,Junyuan Zhang,Weijia Li,Conghui He,Yafei Wang,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A plug-and-play visual token pruning framework (Prune2Drive) for multi-view vision-language models in autonomous driving that reduces token counts with a diversity-aware token selection and a view-adaptive pruning controller, enabling significant speedups and memory savings with minimal performance loss, without model retraining or access to attention maps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous driving with high-resolution, multi-view inputs imposes large computational overhead for vision-language models due to quadratic self-attention. There is a need for efficient, retraining-free token pruning that preserves task performance while reducing latency and memory usage.

Method: Two core components: (1) diversity-aware token selection inspired by farthest point sampling to ensure semantic and spatial coverage across views, not solely attention scores; (2) a view-adaptive pruning controller that learns optimal per-view pruning ratios based on each camera's importance to downstream driving tasks. The approach is plug-and-play and compatible with efficient attention implementations, requiring no retraining or access to attention maps.

Result: On DriveLM and DriveLMM-o1 benchmarks, Prune2Drive achieves substantial speedups and memory savings. With only 10% of visual tokens retained, it delivers a 6.40× speedup in the prefilling phase and uses 13.4% of the original FLOPs, with only a 3% drop in performance on the DriveLM benchmark.

Conclusion: Prune2Drive offers an effective, retraining-free token pruning solution for multi-view VLMs in autonomous driving, enabling efficient deployment while maintaining driving-task performance; its view-aware pruning adapts to camera importance, and it is compatible with modern efficient attention implementations.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as a promising paradigm in
autonomous driving (AD), offering a unified framework for perception,
reasoning, and decision-making by jointly modeling visual inputs and natural
language instructions. However, their deployment is hindered by the significant
computational overhead incurred when processing high-resolution, multi-view
images, a standard setup in AD systems with six or more synchronized cameras.
This overhead stems from the large number of visual tokens generated during
encoding, increasing inference latency and memory consumption due to the
quadratic complexity of self-attention. To address these challenges, we propose
Prune2Drive, a plug-and-play visual token pruning framework for multi-view VLMs
in autonomous driving. Prune2Drive introduces two core innovations: (i) a
diversity-aware token selection mechanism inspired by farthest point sampling,
which prioritizes semantic and spatial coverage across views rather than
relying solely on attention scores, and (ii) a view-adaptive pruning controller
that learns optimal pruning ratios for each camera view based on their
importance to downstream driving tasks. Unlike prior methods, Prune2Drive does
not require model retraining or access to attention maps, making it compatible
with modern efficient attention implementations. Extensive experiments on two
large-scale multi-view driving benchmarks, DriveLM and DriveLMM-o1, show that
Prune2Drive achieves significant speedups and memory savings while maintaining
or improving task performance. When retaining only 10% of the visual tokens,
our method achieves a 6.40$\times$ speedup in the prefilling phase and consumes
13.4% of the original FLOPs, with only a 3% performance drop on the DriveLM
benchmark.

### [9] [DAASH: A Meta-Attack Framework for Synthesizing Effective and Stealthy Adversarial Examples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13309)
*Abdullah Al Nomaan Nafi,Habibur Rahaman,Zafaryab Haider,Tanzim Mahfuz,Fnu Suya,Swarup Bhunia,Prabuddha Chakraborty*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DAASH is a differentiable meta-attack framework that composes Lp-based attacks in a multi-stage process with adaptive weighting and a meta-loss to produce perceptually aligned adversarial examples, outperforms state-of-the-art perceptual attacks, and generalizes to unseen defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Lp-bounded adversarial examples often do not align with human perceptual similarity. The paper investigates whether Lp-attack insights can improve perceptual efficacy and introduces a framework that leverages multiple base attacks to generate perceptually aligned adversaries.

Method: A fully differentiable, multi-stage framework. At each stage, DAASH aggregates candidate adversaries from multiple base Lp-based attacks using learned adaptive weights, then passes the result to the next stage. A meta-loss jointly minimizes misclassification and perceptual distortion to modulate each base attack's contribution over stages.

Result: DAASH significantly outperforms AdvAD on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, achieving higher attack success rates (approx. 20.63% improvement) and better perceptual quality as measured by SSIM, LPIPS, and FID (improvements ≈ 11, 0.015, and 5.7, respectively). It also generalizes well to unseen defenses, making it a strong baseline for robustness evaluation without defense-specific handcrafted attacks.

Conclusion: A practical, generalizable method for generating perceptually aligned adversarial examples by leveraging existing Lp-based attacks within a differentiable, multi-stage meta-attack framework; suitable for robust evaluation across datasets and defenses.

Abstract: Numerous techniques have been proposed for generating adversarial examples in
white-box settings under strict Lp-norm constraints. However, such norm-bounded
examples often fail to align well with human perception, and only recently have
a few methods begun specifically exploring perceptually aligned adversarial
examples. Moreover, it remains unclear whether insights from Lp-constrained
attacks can be effectively leveraged to improve perceptual efficacy. In this
paper, we introduce DAASH, a fully differentiable meta-attack framework that
generates effective and perceptually aligned adversarial examples by
strategically composing existing Lp-based attack methods. DAASH operates in a
multi-stage fashion: at each stage, it aggregates candidate adversarial
examples from multiple base attacks using learned, adaptive weights and
propagates the result to the next stage. A novel meta-loss function guides this
process by jointly minimizing misclassification loss and perceptual distortion,
enabling the framework to dynamically modulate the contribution of each base
attack throughout the stages. We evaluate DAASH on adversarially trained models
across CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet. Despite relying solely on
Lp-constrained based methods, DAASH significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
perceptual attacks such as AdvAD -- achieving higher attack success rates
(e.g., 20.63\% improvement) and superior visual quality, as measured by SSIM,
LPIPS, and FID (improvements $\approx$ of 11, 0.015, and 5.7, respectively).
Furthermore, DAASH generalizes well to unseen defenses, making it a practical
and strong baseline for evaluating robustness without requiring handcrafted
adaptive attacks for each new defense.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable objective, reproducible, data-driven assessment of aesthetic outcomes following facial plastic surgery for planning, counseling, and multi-practice benchmarking.

Method: A pipeline combining automated landmark detection, geometric facial symmetry computation, deep-learning–based age estimation, and nasal morphology analysis. Utilizes the largest curated dataset of paired pre- and post-operative facial images (7,160 photos from 1,259 patients), including a rhinoplasty-focused subset (732 images from 366 patients). Performs statistical analyses of nasal metrics and global symmetry/age, and evaluates identity preservation and inter-practitioner variability.

Result: In rhinoplasty subset, 96.2% improved in at least one nasal measurement; significant changes in alar width to face width (77.0%), nose length to face height (41.5%), alar width to intercanthal (39.3%) with p<0.001. In the broader frontal-view cohort (989 filtered), 71.3% showed significant improvements in global symmetry or perceived age (p<0.01). Identity remains highly stable post-operatively (True Match Rates 99.5% and 99.6% at FMR 0.01% for rhinoplasty-specific and general cohorts). Dataset size: 7,160 photos (1,259 patients); rhinoplasty subset: 732 photos (366 patients). Provides reproducible benchmarks and a dataset to support data-driven surgical planning and outcome evaluation across practices.

Conclusion: The framework delivers scalable, interpretable, and objective outcome evaluation with strong evidence of nasal and global aesthetic improvements, high identity preservation, and inter-practitioner benchmarking, facilitating data-driven planning and counseling across practices.

Abstract: We introduce a scalable, interpretable computer-vision framework for
quantifying aesthetic outcomes of facial plastic surgery using frontal
photographs. Our pipeline leverages automated landmark detection, geometric
facial symmetry computation, deep-learning-based age estimation, and nasal
morphology analysis. To perform this study, we first assemble the largest
curated dataset of paired pre- and post-operative facial images to date,
encompassing 7,160 photographs from 1,259 patients. This dataset includes a
dedicated rhinoplasty-only subset consisting of 732 images from 366 patients,
96.2% of whom showed improvement in at least one of the three nasal
measurements with statistically significant group-level change. Among these
patients, the greatest statistically significant improvements (p < 0.001)
occurred in the alar width to face width ratio (77.0%), nose length to face
height ratio (41.5%), and alar width to intercanthal ratio (39.3%). Among the
broader frontal-view cohort, comprising 989 rigorously filtered subjects, 71.3%
exhibited significant enhancements in global facial symmetry or perceived age
(p < 0.01). Importantly, our analysis shows that patient identity remains
consistent post-operatively, with True Match Rates of 99.5% and 99.6% at a
False Match Rate of 0.01% for the rhinoplasty-specific and general patient
cohorts, respectively. Additionally, we analyze inter-practitioner variability
in improvement rates. By providing reproducible, quantitative benchmarks and a
novel dataset, our pipeline facilitates data-driven surgical planning, patient
counseling, and objective outcome evaluation across practices.

### [11] [Applications of Small Language Models in Medical Imaging Classification with a Focus on Prompt Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13378)
*Yiting Wang,Ziwei Wang,Jiachen Zhong,Di Zhu,Weiyi Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Prompt engineering enables small language models (SLMs) to approach LLM performance on a medical imaging classification task, reducing cost and privacy concerns in healthcare; three prompt strategies (baseline, incremental summaries, correction-based reflective prompts) were tested on NIH Chest X-ray data for AP vs PA classification, with some SLMs achieving competitive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of large language models in healthcare (high compute cost, limited accessibility, data privacy) by evaluating whether SLMs can perform a medically relevant task competitively through careful prompt design.

Method: Evaluate multiple small language models on an NIH Chest X-ray dataset task of classifying chest X-ray positions (AP vs PA). Compare three prompt designs: 1) baseline instruction prompts, 2) incremental summary prompts, 3) correction-based reflective prompts.

Result: Certain SLMs achieved competitive accuracy with well-crafted prompts; prompt engineering substantially enhances SLM performance in healthcare applications, reducing the need for deep AI expertise by end users.

Conclusion: Prompt engineering can unlock competitive performance of SLMs for healthcare classification tasks, offering a more accessible and cost-effective alternative to heavyweight LLMs without sacrificing accuracy when designed thoughtfully.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in natural
language processing and multi-modal understanding. However, their high
computational cost, limited accessibility, and data privacy concerns hinder
their adoption in resource-constrained healthcare environments. This study
investigates the performance of small language models (SLMs) in a medical
imaging classification task, comparing different models and prompt designs to
identify the optimal combination for accuracy and usability. Using the NIH
Chest X-ray dataset, we evaluate multiple SLMs on the task of classifying chest
X-ray positions (anteroposterior [AP] vs. posteroanterior [PA]) under three
prompt strategies: baseline instruction, incremental summary prompts, and
correction-based reflective prompts. Our results show that certain SLMs achieve
competitive accuracy with well-crafted prompts, suggesting that prompt
engineering can substantially enhance SLM performance in healthcare
applications without requiring deep AI expertise from end users.

### [13] [Mitigating Easy Option Bias in Multiple-Choice Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13428)
*Hao Zhang,Chen Li,Basura Fernando*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Easy-Options Bias (EOB) lets vision-language models answer VQA questions using only vision and options, not the question; GroundAttack generates hard, visually plausible negatives to remove this shortcut; applying it to NExT-QA and MMStar yields EOB-free annotations where models perform near random under (V+O) and poorly (non-saturated) even with (V+Q+O).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To diagnose and quantify shortcut biases in VQA benchmarks that let models exploit dataset artifacts instead of truly reasoning about the question; to push toward more robust evaluation by eliminating visual-option shortcuts and exposing genuine VQA ability.

Method: Identify EOB bias across multiple benchmarks. GroundAttack toolkit automatically creates hard negative options that are visually plausible with correct answers. Apply GroundAttack to NExT-QA and MMStar to produce EOB-free annotations. Evaluate current VLMs under (V+O) and (V+Q+O) settings on these annotations.

Result: Found that models under EOB-free annotations perform near random with (V+O) and fail to saturate even with (V+Q+O), indicating that prior gains were largely due to EOB shortcuts. GroundAttack provides a practical approach to generate challenging negatives and reveal true VQA ability.

Conclusion: EOB is a systemic bias in VQA benchmarks that inflates apparent model capabilities. Removing it via EOB-free annotations yields a more realistic evaluation and highlights the need for bias-aware benchmark design. GroundAttack offers a viable toolkit for constructing more challenging datasets; expect code and new annotations to be released.

Abstract: In this early study, we observe an Easy-Options Bias (EOB) issue in some
multiple-choice Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks such as MMStar,
RealWorldQA, SEED-Bench, Next-QA, STAR benchmark and Video-MME. This bias
allows vision-language models (VLMs) to select the correct answer using only
the vision (V) and options (O) as inputs, without the need for the question
(Q). Through grounding experiments, we attribute the bias to an imbalance in
visual relevance: the correct answer typically aligns more closely with the
visual contents than the negative options in feature space, creating a shortcut
for VLMs to infer the answer via simply vision-option similarity matching. To
fix this, we introduce GroundAttack, a toolkit that automatically generates
hard negative options as visually plausible as the correct answer. We apply it
to the NExT-QA and MMStar datasets, creating new EOB-free annotations. On these
EOB-free annotations, current VLMs approach to random accuracies under (V+O)
settings, and drop to non-saturated accuracies under (V+Q+O) settings,
providing a more realistic evaluation of VLMs' QA ability. Codes and new
annotations will be released soon.

### [14] [Structured Prompting and Multi-Agent Knowledge Distillation for Traffic Video Interpretation and Risk Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13439)
*Yunxiang Yang,Ningning Xu,Jidong J. Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A 3B VLM named VISTA distills knowledge from GPT-4o and o3-mini via structured CoT prompts to generate pseudo-annotations and train a lightweight model for real-time, risk-aware traffic captioning from low-res videos, achieving strong metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scalability, generalization, and real-time edge deployment for highway scene understanding; manual annotation is costly; aim to leverage multi-agent LLMs to produce high-quality pseudo-annotations for training a compact model.

Method: Structured prompting with Chain-of-Thought across two VLMs (GPT-4o and o3-mini) to generate rich, multi-perspective outputs used as pseudo-annotations; supervised fine-tuning of a 3B-scale student VLM (VISTA) for low-resolution traffic video captioning and risk-aware descriptions.

Result: VISTA achieves strong captioning metrics (BLEU-4, METEOR, ROUGE-L, CIDEr) with far fewer parameters than the teacher models, enabling edge deployment and real-time risk monitoring.

Conclusion: Knowledge distillation with structured multi-agent supervision can empower compact VLMs to capture complex reasoning for intelligent traffic analysis, enabling efficient, edge-friendly ITS solutions.

Abstract: Comprehensive highway scene understanding and robust traffic risk inference
are vital for advancing Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and autonomous
driving. Traditional approaches often struggle with scalability and
generalization, particularly under the complex and dynamic conditions of
real-world environments. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel
structured prompting and knowledge distillation framework that enables
automatic generation of high-quality traffic scene annotations and contextual
risk assessments. Our framework orchestrates two large Vision-Language Models
(VLMs): GPT-4o and o3-mini, using a structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) strategy
to produce rich, multi-perspective outputs. These outputs serve as
knowledge-enriched pseudo-annotations for supervised fine-tuning of a much
smaller student VLM. The resulting compact 3B-scale model, named VISTA (Vision
for Intelligent Scene and Traffic Analysis), is capable of understanding
low-resolution traffic videos and generating semantically faithful, risk-aware
captions. Despite its significantly reduced parameter count, VISTA achieves
strong performance across established captioning metrics (BLEU-4, METEOR,
ROUGE-L, and CIDEr) when benchmarked against its teacher models. This
demonstrates that effective knowledge distillation and structured multi-agent
supervision can empower lightweight VLMs to capture complex reasoning
capabilities. The compact architecture of VISTA facilitates efficient
deployment on edge devices, enabling real-time risk monitoring without
requiring extensive infrastructure upgrades.

### [15] [EDTalk++: Full Disentanglement for Controllable Talking Head Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13442)
*Shuai Tan,Bin Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A four-space disentanglement framework (mouth, pose, eye, expression) for controllable talking head generation with orthogonal bases and an audio-to-motion module, enabling independent, cross-modal synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve independent control over multiple facial motions and support diverse input modalities; existing methods often fail to decouple and share representations across inputs.

Method: Four lightweight modules decompose facial dynamics into latent spaces: mouth, pose, eye, expression; each space uses learnable bases with orthogonality enforced; training allocates motion responsibilities without external priors; bases stored in banks to enable shared priors with audio input; includes an Audio-to-Motion module for audio-driven synthesis; supports video or audio conditioned inputs.

Result: Experiments demonstrate effective disentanglement and cross-modal sharing, validating the framework's ability to independently control facial motions and leverage shared priors across modalities.

Conclusion: EDTalk++ provides a comprehensive disentanglement framework for controllable talking head generation, enabling modular, audio-driven synthesis with orthogonal bases and motion banks.

Abstract: Achieving disentangled control over multiple facial motions and accommodating
diverse input modalities greatly enhances the application and entertainment of
the talking head generation. This necessitates a deep exploration of the
decoupling space for facial features, ensuring that they a) operate
independently without mutual interference and b) can be preserved to share with
different modal inputs, both aspects often neglected in existing methods. To
address this gap, this paper proposes EDTalk++, a novel full disentanglement
framework for controllable talking head generation. Our framework enables
individual manipulation of mouth shape, head pose, eye movement, and emotional
expression, conditioned on video or audio inputs. Specifically, we employ four
lightweight modules to decompose the facial dynamics into four distinct latent
spaces representing mouth, pose, eye, and expression, respectively. Each space
is characterized by a set of learnable bases whose linear combinations define
specific motions. To ensure independence and accelerate training, we enforce
orthogonality among bases and devise an efficient training strategy to allocate
motion responsibilities to each space without relying on external knowledge.
The learned bases are then stored in corresponding banks, enabling shared
visual priors with audio input. Furthermore, considering the properties of each
space, we propose an Audio-to-Motion module for audio-driven talking head
synthesis. Experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of
EDTalk++.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision Transformers (ViTs) outperform CNNs in kidney stone classification on endoscopic images, especially in complex patches, with ViT-base pretrained on ImageNet-21k achieving the strongest results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess whether ViTs can capture long-range dependencies and generalize better under variable endoscopic imaging conditions compared to CNNs (ResNet50) for kidney stone classification.

Method: Compare ViT-base (ImageNet-21k pretrained) to ResNet50 on two ex vivo datasets (CCD camera and flexible ureteroscope images), using subsets such as Section patches (complex) and mixed-view, evaluating accuracy, F1-score, precision, and recall.

Result: ViT-base consistently outperforms ResNet50 across imaging conditions. In the most visually complex subset (Section patches), ViT achieves 95.2% accuracy and 95.1% F1-score vs 64.5% and 59.3% for ResNet50. In the mixed-view CCD-camera subset, ViT reaches 87.1% accuracy vs 78.4% for CNN, with improvements in precision and recall.

Conclusion: ViT-based architectures offer superior classification performance and present a scalable alternative to CNNs for kidney stone image analysis.

Abstract: Kidney stone classification from endoscopic images is critical for
personalized treatment and recurrence prevention. While convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) have shown promise in this task, their limited ability to
capture long-range dependencies can hinder performance under variable imaging
conditions. This study presents a comparative analysis between Vision
Transformers (ViTs) and CNN-based models, evaluating their performance on two
ex vivo datasets comprising CCD camera and flexible ureteroscope images. The
ViT-base model pretrained on ImageNet-21k consistently outperformed a ResNet50
baseline across multiple imaging conditions. For instance, in the most visually
complex subset (Section patches from endoscopic images), the ViT model achieved
95.2% accuracy and 95.1% F1-score, compared to 64.5% and 59.3% with ResNet50.
In the mixed-view subset from CCD-camera images, ViT reached 87.1% accuracy
versus 78.4% with CNN. These improvements extend across precision and recall as
well. The results demonstrate that ViT-based architectures provide superior
classification performance and offer a scalable alternative to conventional
CNNs for kidney stone image analysis.

### [19] [MINR: Efficient Implicit Neural Representations for Multi-Image Encoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13471)
*Wenyong Zhou,Taiqiang Wu,Zhengwu Liu,Yuxin Cheng,Chen Zhang,Ngai Wong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MINR shares selective intermediate layers across multiple images in implicit neural representations to cut parameters by up to 60% while preserving performance, with per-image input/output layers and a per-image projection layer; scalable to 100 images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training separate INRs for each image is memory and compute inefficient for multi-image tasks. The authors observe that corresponding intermediate-layer weight distributions are similar across trained INRs, motivating layer sharing to compress the model while maintaining image-specific capabilities.

Method: Identify and share intermediate layers across images while keeping input and output layers image-specific. Add a per-image projection layer to capture unique features. Evaluate on image reconstruction and super-resolution, testing robustness across backbones and scaling to many images.

Result: Achieves up to 60% parameter savings with performance comparable to separate INRs. Scales to 100 images while maintaining an average PSNR around 34 dB. Demonstrates robustness across backbone architectures.

Conclusion: MINR provides a robust, efficient framework for multi-image implicit representations by sharing layers across images and adding image-specific projection layers, enabling scalable parameter savings without sacrificing quality.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) aim to parameterize discrete signals
through implicit continuous functions. However, formulating each image with a
separate neural network~(typically, a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)) leads to
computational and storage inefficiencies when encoding multi-images. To address
this issue, we propose MINR, sharing specific layers to encode multi-image
efficiently. We first compare the layer-wise weight distributions for several
trained INRs and find that corresponding intermediate layers follow highly
similar distribution patterns. Motivated by this, we share these intermediate
layers across multiple images while preserving the input and output layers as
input-specific. In addition, we design an extra novel projection layer for each
image to capture its unique features. Experimental results on image
reconstruction and super-resolution tasks demonstrate that MINR can save up to
60\% parameters while maintaining comparable performance. Particularly, MINR
scales effectively to handle 100 images, maintaining an average peak
signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 34 dB. Further analysis of various backbones
proves the robustness of the proposed MINR.

### [20] [Distribution-Aware Hadamard Quantization for Hardware-Efficient Implicit Neural Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13478)
*Wenyong Zhou,Jiachen Ren,Taiqiang Wu,Yuxin Cheng,Zhengwu Liu,Ngai Wong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DHQ (distribution-aware Hadamard quantization) quantizes both weights and activations in Implicit Neural Representations by using a Hadamard transform to standardize layer-wise distributions into a unified bell-shaped form, enabling a single quantizer. It is implemented on FPGA and shows substantial hardware savings over full-precision and prior quantization methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: INRs require full-precision computation for high accuracy. Prior work mainly quantized weights, neglecting activations, leading to limited hardware gains. Layer-wise distribution differences (first/last layer vs. middle, last activation vs. earlier) motivate a unified, hardware-friendly quantization strategy.

Method: Apply Hadamard transformation to reshape diverse weight/activation distributions into a unified distribution, then apply a standard quantizer (DHQ) to both weights and activations. Validate with FPGA implementation and image reconstruction tasks.

Result: DHQ outperforms prior quantization methods, achieving latency reduction of 32.7%, energy reduction of 40.1%, and resource utilization reduction up to 98.3% compared to full-precision baselines.

Conclusion: DHQ provides hardware-efficient, distribution-aware quantization for INRs by standardizing distributions with Hadamard transform, enabling effective joint quantization of weights and activations and substantial hardware savings without sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) encode discrete signals using
Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) with complex activation functions. While INRs
achieve superior performance, they depend on full-precision number
representation for accurate computation, resulting in significant hardware
overhead. Previous INR quantization approaches have primarily focused on weight
quantization, offering only limited hardware savings due to the lack of
activation quantization. To fully exploit the hardware benefits of
quantization, we propose DHQ, a novel distribution-aware Hadamard quantization
scheme that targets both weights and activations in INRs. Our analysis shows
that the weights in the first and last layers have distributions distinct from
those in the intermediate layers, while the activations in the last layer
differ significantly from those in the preceding layers. Instead of customizing
quantizers individually, we utilize the Hadamard transformation to standardize
these diverse distributions into a unified bell-shaped form, supported by both
empirical evidence and theoretical analysis, before applying a standard
quantizer. To demonstrate the practical advantages of our approach, we present
an FPGA implementation of DHQ that highlights its hardware efficiency.
Experiments on diverse image reconstruction tasks show that DHQ outperforms
previous quantization methods, reducing latency by 32.7\%, energy consumption
by 40.1\%, and resource utilization by up to 98.3\% compared to full-precision
counterparts.

*Wenyong Zhou,Yuxin Cheng,Zhengwu Liu,Taiqiang Wu,Chen Zhang,Ngai Wong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Robust INRs: a robust loss to defend against weight perturbations achieving up to 7.5 dB PSNR gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) encode signals continuously via neural networks but are vulnerable to weight perturbations, challenging real-world deployment. This study is the first to examine INR robustness and aims to preserve reconstruction quality under perturbations.

Method: Formulate robustness by minimizing the difference between losses with and without weight perturbations; derive a novel robust loss that regulates the gradient of the reconstruction loss with respect to weights, thus improving stability under perturbations.

Result: Experiments across multiple modalities show up to 7.5 dB improvement in PSNR under noisy conditions compared to original INRs.

Conclusion: The proposed robust loss enhances INR robustness, enabling more reliable real-world deployment of INR-based reconstruction across diverse modalities.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) encode discrete signals in a
continuous manner using neural networks, demonstrating significant value across
various multimedia applications. However, the vulnerability of INRs presents a
critical challenge for their real-world deployments, as the network weights
might be subjected to unavoidable perturbations. In this work, we investigate
the robustness of INRs for the first time and find that even minor
perturbations can lead to substantial performance degradation in the quality of
signal reconstruction. To mitigate this issue, we formulate the robustness
problem in INRs by minimizing the difference between loss with and without
weight perturbations. Furthermore, we derive a novel robust loss function to
regulate the gradient of the reconstruction loss with respect to weights,
thereby enhancing the robustness. Extensive experiments on reconstruction tasks
across multiple modalities demonstrate that our method achieves up to a 7.5~dB
improvement in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) values compared to original
INRs under noisy conditions.

*Liangyu Fu,Xuecheng Wu,Danlei Huang,Xinyi Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-task fused 2D/3D CNN architecture (FAMNet) merges AMNet2D and AMNet3D with a shared ResNet-18 backbone and attention modules to improve micro-expressions recognition by jointly learning FAUD; achieves strong UAR/UF1 on SAMM, CASME II, MMEW, and CAS(ME)3 datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Micro-expressions are brief and low in intensity, making it hard to capture fine-grained spatiotemporal cues; existing MER methods use static/dynamic inputs and struggle to extract omni-directional features; a fusion of 2D/3D CNNs with multi-task learning can better encode fine-grained ME dynamics.

Method: A fusion architecture FAMNet that merges 2D AMNet2D and 3D AMNet3D, both built on a shared ResNet-18 backbone with attention modules; employs dataset-specific data loading for each branch; jointly trained on micro-expression recognition (MER) and facial action unit detection (FAUD) with hard parameter sharing to promote information exchange.

Result: On SAMM, CASME II, and MMEW, FAMNet achieves 83.75% UAR and 84.03% UF1; on CAS(ME)^3, it achieves 51% UAR and 43.42% UF1.

Conclusion: The proposed FAMNet effectively extracts omni-directional spatiotemporal ME features and benefits from multi-task learning, yielding significant improvements in MER performance across multiple datasets.

Abstract: Micro-expressions recognition (MER) has essential application value in many
fields, but the short duration and low intensity of micro-expressions (MEs)
bring considerable challenges to MER. The current MER methods in deep learning
mainly include three data loading methods: static images, dynamic image
sequence, and a combination of the two streams. How to effectively extract MEs'
fine-grained and spatiotemporal features has been difficult to solve. This
paper proposes a new MER method based on multi-task learning and hierarchical
attention, which fully extracts MEs' omni-directional features by merging 2D
and 3D CNNs. The fusion model consists of a 2D CNN AMNet2D and a 3D CNN
AMNet3D, with similar structures consisting of a shared backbone network
Resnet18 and attention modules. During training, the model adopts different
data loading methods to adapt to two specific networks respectively, jointly
trains on the tasks of MER and facial action unit detection (FAUD), and adopts
the parameter hard sharing for information association, which further improves
the effect of the MER task, and the final fused model is called FAMNet.
Extensive experimental results show that our proposed FAMNet significantly
improves task performance. On the SAMM, CASME II and MMEW datasets, FAMNet
achieves 83.75% (UAR) and 84.03% (UF1). Furthermore, on the challenging
CAS(ME)$^3$ dataset, FAMNet achieves 51% (UAR) and 43.42% (UF1).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CORENet is a plug-and-play cross-modal denoising framework that uses LiDAR supervision during training to denoise 4D radar data for voxel-based object detection, while enabling radar-only inference; it shows improved detection robustness on the noisy Dual-Radar dataset compared to mainstream methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 4D radar point clouds are sparse and noisy, which degrades perception. Leveraging LiDAR during training can help identify noise patterns and learn discriminative features without requiring LiDAR at inference.

Method: A cross-modal denoising network (CORENet) that uses LiDAR supervision to identify noise and extract robust features from raw 4D radar. It is designed as a plug-and-play module that can be integrated into existing voxel-based detectors without modifying pipelines; LiDAR data is used only during training for supervision; inference uses radar data only.

Result: Evaluated on the challenging Dual-Radar dataset with high noise levels; CORENet achieves superior robustness and outperforms existing mainstream approaches in detection performance.

Conclusion: LiDAR-guided training can enhance radar-based 4D perception and the proposed CORENet provides a practical, plug-and-play solution for robust radar perception without changing inference-time requirements.

Abstract: 4D radar-based object detection has garnered great attention for its
robustness in adverse weather conditions and capacity to deliver rich spatial
information across diverse driving scenarios. Nevertheless, the sparse and
noisy nature of 4D radar point clouds poses substantial challenges for
effective perception. To address the limitation, we present CORENet, a novel
cross-modal denoising framework that leverages LiDAR supervision to identify
noise patterns and extract discriminative features from raw 4D radar data.
Designed as a plug-and-play architecture, our solution enables seamless
integration into voxel-based detection frameworks without modifying existing
pipelines. Notably, the proposed method only utilizes LiDAR data for
cross-modal supervision during training while maintaining full radar-only
operation during inference. Extensive evaluation on the challenging Dual-Radar
dataset, which is characterized by elevated noise level, demonstrates the
effectiveness of our framework in enhancing detection robustness. Comprehensive
experiments validate that CORENet achieves superior performance compared to
existing mainstream approaches.

### [26] [Multi-view Clustering via Bi-level Decoupling and Consistency Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13499)
*Shihao Dong,Yuhui Zheng,Huiying Xu,Xinzhong Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BDCL introduces a bi-level decoupling and consistency learning framework to enhance multi-view clustering by decoupling feature and cluster spaces, combining reconstruction and contrastive learning to preserve view-private information, and enforcing cross-view clustering consistency to improve intra-cluster compactness and inter-cluster separability, validated on five benchmarks with state-of-the-art results and open-sourced code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-view data exposes both shared (consistent) and view-specific (private) information. Prior work often emphasizes clustering results but underutilizes representation learning for improving clustering quality. BDCL targets both inter-cluster discriminability and intra-cluster compactness by learning richer, decoupled, and consistent representations.

Method: 1) Multi-view instance learning module: reconstructs each view via an autoencoder and uses contrastive learning to align consistent information while preserving private features. 2) Bi-level decoupling: separates feature space and cluster space to enhance discriminability at both levels. 3) Consistency learning: treats different views of the sample and their neighbors as positive pairs to learn consistent clustering assignments and to compress intra-cluster space.

Result: Experimental evaluation on five benchmark datasets shows that BDCL achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods. The approach is accompanied by publicly available code at the authors' repository.

Conclusion: BDCL provides a comprehensive framework that jointly learns decoupled but consistent representations with cross-view clustering consistency, leading to improved intra-cluster compactness and inter-cluster discriminability in multi-view clustering.

Abstract: Multi-view clustering has shown to be an effective method for analyzing
underlying patterns in multi-view data. The performance of clustering can be
improved by learning the consistency and complementarity between multi-view
features, however, cluster-oriented representation learning is often
overlooked. In this paper, we propose a novel Bi-level Decoupling and
Consistency Learning framework (BDCL) to further explore the effective
representation for multi-view data to enhance inter-cluster discriminability
and intra-cluster compactness of features in multi-view clustering. Our
framework comprises three modules: 1) The multi-view instance learning module
aligns the consistent information while preserving the private features between
views through reconstruction autoencoder and contrastive learning. 2) The
bi-level decoupling of features and clusters enhances the discriminability of
feature space and cluster space. 3) The consistency learning module treats the
different views of the sample and their neighbors as positive pairs, learns the
consistency of their clustering assignments, and further compresses the
intra-cluster space. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared with the SOTA
methods. Our code is published on https://github.com/LouisDong95/BDCL.

### [27] [MR6D: Benchmarking 6D Pose Estimation for Mobile Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13775)
*Anas Gouda,Shrutarv Awasthi,Christian Blesing,Lokeshwaran Manohar,Frank Hoffmann,Alice Kirchheim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MR6D introduces 92 real-world scenes with 16 objects for 6D pose estimation in mobile robotics, highlighting challenges like distant viewpoints and heavy occlusion, and showing that current methods struggle—especially 2D segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 6D pose datasets focus on small household objects used with manipulators, which do not reflect mobile robots' need to perceive and interact with larger objects at a distance under varied perspectives and occlusions. MR6D addresses this gap for industrial/mobile settings.

Method: Dataset collection of 92 real-world scenes with 16 unique objects, including static and dynamic interactions. The scenes are designed to reflect mobile robot challenges: distant viewpoints, varied object configurations, larger object sizes, and complex occlusion/self-occlusion. Initial experiments evaluate current 6D pose pipelines and identify 2D segmentation as a bottleneck.

Result: Baseline 6D pipelines underperform in MR6D’s conditions; 2D segmentation is a notable hurdle in achieving robust pose estimates.

Conclusion: MR6D provides a foundation for developing and evaluating pose estimation methods tailored to mobile robotics in industrial environments and is publicly available for research use.

Abstract: Existing 6D pose estimation datasets primarily focus on small household
objects typically handled by robot arm manipulators, limiting their relevance
to mobile robotics. Mobile platforms often operate without manipulators,
interact with larger objects, and face challenges such as long-range
perception, heavy self-occlusion, and diverse camera perspectives. While recent
models generalize well to unseen objects, evaluations remain confined to
household-like settings that overlook these factors. We introduce MR6D, a
dataset designed for 6D pose estimation for mobile robots in industrial
environments. It includes 92 real-world scenes featuring 16 unique objects
across static and dynamic interactions. MR6D captures the challenges specific
to mobile platforms, including distant viewpoints, varied object
configurations, larger object sizes, and complex occlusion/self-occlusion
patterns. Initial experiments reveal that current 6D pipelines underperform in
these settings, with 2D segmentation being another hurdle. MR6D establishes a
foundation for developing and evaluating pose estimation methods tailored to
the demands of mobile robotics. The dataset is available at

### [28] [AdaptiveAE: An Adaptive Exposure Strategy for HDR Capturing in Dynamic Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13503)
*Tianyi Xu,Fan Zhang,Boxin Shi,Tianfan Xue,Yujin Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AdaptiveAE is a reinforcement learning-based HDR exposure scheduler that optimizes shutter speed and ISO for dynamic scenes, incorporating motion blur and noise modeling in training; claims state-of-the-art HDR reconstruction given an exposure budget.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional HDR methods treat exposure parameters separately and neglect their interaction with motion blur and sensor noise, especially in dynamic scenes; a joint optimization under a budget is needed.

Method: Uses reinforcement learning to choose ISO and shutter sequences; includes an image synthesis pipeline simulating motion blur and noise; leverages semantic information and exposure histograms; adapts to a user-defined exposure-time budget.

Result: Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art HDR reconstruction quality.

Conclusion: AdaptiveAE provides a better exposure schedule by jointly optimizing shutter speed and ISO while modeling blur and noise, improving HDR results in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Mainstream high dynamic range imaging techniques typically rely on fusing
multiple images captured with different exposure setups (shutter speed and
ISO). A good balance between shutter speed and ISO is crucial for achieving
high-quality HDR, as high ISO values introduce significant noise, while long
shutter speeds can lead to noticeable motion blur. However, existing methods
often overlook the complex interaction between shutter speed and ISO and fail
to account for motion blur effects in dynamic scenes.
  In this work, we propose AdaptiveAE, a reinforcement learning-based method
that optimizes the selection of shutter speed and ISO combinations to maximize
HDR reconstruction quality in dynamic environments. AdaptiveAE integrates an
image synthesis pipeline that incorporates motion blur and noise simulation
into our training procedure, leveraging semantic information and exposure
histograms. It can adaptively select optimal ISO and shutter speed sequences
based on a user-defined exposure time budget, and find a better exposure
schedule than traditional solutions. Experimental results across multiple
datasets demonstrate that it achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: We introduce ResPlan, a large-scale dataset of 17,000 detailed, structurally
rich, and realistic residential floor plans, created to advance spatial AI
research. Each plan includes precise annotations of architectural elements
(walls, doors, windows, balconies) and functional spaces (such as kitchens,
bedrooms, and bathrooms). ResPlan addresses key limitations of existing
datasets such as RPLAN (Wu et al., 2019) and MSD (van Engelenburg et al., 2024)
by offering enhanced visual fidelity and greater structural diversity,
reflecting realistic and non-idealized residential layouts. Designed as a
versatile, general-purpose resource, ResPlan supports a wide range of
applications including robotics, reinforcement learning, generative AI, virtual
and augmented reality, simulations, and game development. Plans are provided in
both geometric and graph-based formats, enabling direct integration into
simulation engines and fast 3D conversion. A key contribution is an open-source
pipeline for geometry cleaning, alignment, and annotation refinement.
Additionally, ResPlan includes structured representations of room connectivity,
supporting graph-based spatial reasoning tasks. Finally, we present comparative
analyses with existing benchmarks and outline several open benchmark tasks
enabled by ResPlan. Ultimately, ResPlan offers a significant advance in scale,
realism, and usability, providing a robust foundation for developing and
benchmarking next-generation spatial intelligence systems.

### [30] [Bridging the Gap: Doubles Badminton Analysis with Singles-Trained Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13507)
*Seungheon Baek,Jinhyuk Yun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Extends singles-trained pose-based shot recognition to doubles badminton by transferring models, using ViT-Pose for keypoints, contrastive ST-GCN embeddings, a custom multi-object tracker, and a Transformer classifier to detect shots; demonstrates feasibility and sets groundwork for doubles analytics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Doubles badminton is understudied due to data and tracking challenges; developing methods to leverage existing singles data to enable reliable doubles shot recognition and analytics.

Method: Extract keypoints from ShuttleSet singles data with ViT-Pose; embed via contrastive learning built on ST-GCN; employ a custom multi-object tracking algorithm to stabilize player IDs during fast, overlapping duels; train a Transformer-based classifier to predict shot occurrences from learned embeddings.

Result: Demonstrates feasibility of extending pose-based shot recognition to doubles; enables broader analytics; establishes a foundation for doubles-specific datasets.

Conclusion: Transferable singles-trained pose analysis can support doubles badminton analytics and guide future data collection and model development for this dominant but understudied format.

Abstract: Badminton is known as one of the fastest racket sports in the world. Despite
doubles matches being more prevalent in international tournaments than singles,
previous research has mainly focused on singles due to the challenges in data
availability and multi-person tracking. To address this gap, we designed an
approach that transfers singles-trained models to doubles analysis. We
extracted keypoints from the ShuttleSet single matches dataset using ViT-Pose
and embedded them through a contrastive learning framework based on ST-GCN. To
improve tracking stability, we incorporated a custom multi-object tracking
algorithm that resolves ID switching issues from fast and overlapping player
movements. A Transformer-based classifier then determines shot occurrences
based on the learned embeddings. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of
extending pose-based shot recognition to doubles badminton, broadening
analytics capabilities. This work establishes a foundation for doubles-specific
datasets to enhance understanding of this predominant yet understudied format
of the fast racket sport.

### [31] [2D Gaussians Meet Visual Tokenizer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13515)
*Yiang Shi,Xiaoyang Guo,Wei Yin,Mingkai Jia,Qian Zhang,Xiaolin Hu,Wenyu Liu,Xinggang Wan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VGQ adds a 2D Gaussian-based tokenizer to capture structure in images, improving over VQ-GAN by modeling geometry (position, rotation, scale) and density-controlled token richness, achieving state-of-the-art reconstruction on ImageNet 256x256.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantization-based tokenizers like VQ-GAN focus on texture/color due to patch-based design, often neglecting geometric structure. A tokenizer that explicitly models spatial structure could improve reconstruction and AR image generation.

Method: Encode image latents as 2D Gaussian distributions and integrate them into a (visual) codebook quantization framework. Model structure-related parameters (position, rotation, scale) and increase Gaussian density to trade off token efficiency against visual richness.

Result: On ImageNet 256x256, VGQ achieves rFID 1.00; with higher Gaussian density, rFID improves to 0.556 and PSNR reaches 24.93, surpassing existing methods.

Conclusion: VGQ enables explicit structural modeling in tokenizers, offering a flexible density-based trade-off between efficiency and visual richness and setting a new benchmark for reconstruction quality; code will be released.

Abstract: The image tokenizer is a critical component in AR image generation, as it
determines how rich and structured visual content is encoded into compact
representations. Existing quantization-based tokenizers such as VQ-GAN
primarily focus on appearance features like texture and color, often neglecting
geometric structures due to their patch-based design. In this work, we explored
how to incorporate more visual information into the tokenizer and proposed a
new framework named Visual Gaussian Quantization (VGQ), a novel tokenizer
paradigm that explicitly enhances structural modeling by integrating 2D
Gaussians into traditional visual codebook quantization frameworks. Our
approach addresses the inherent limitations of naive quantization methods such
as VQ-GAN, which struggle to model structured visual information due to their
patch-based design and emphasis on texture and color. In contrast, VGQ encodes
image latents as 2D Gaussian distributions, effectively capturing geometric and
spatial structures by directly modeling structure-related parameters such as
position, rotation and scale. We further demonstrate that increasing the
density of 2D Gaussians within the tokens leads to significant gains in
reconstruction fidelity, providing a flexible trade-off between token
efficiency and visual richness. On the ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, VGQ achieves
strong reconstruction quality with an rFID score of 1.00. Furthermore, by
increasing the density of 2D Gaussians within the tokens, VGQ gains a
significant boost in reconstruction capability and achieves a state-of-the-art
reconstruction rFID score of 0.556 and a PSNR of 24.93, substantially
outperforming existing methods. Codes will be released soon.

### [32] [Calibrating Biased Distribution in VFM-derived Latent Space via Cross-Domain Geometric Consistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13518)
*Yanbiao Ma,Wei Dai,Bowei Liu,Jiayi Chen,Wenke Huang,Guancheng Wan,Zhiwu Lu,Junchi Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A geometric knowledge-guided distribution calibration framework uses transferable feature geometry from off-the-shelf vision foundation models to align distributions across domains, enabling improved performance in federated learning and long-tailed recognition by generating samples and transferring information from rich to tail classes under privacy and heterogeneity constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a persistent gap between observed training samples and the true data distribution due to sampling bias, noise, and data heterogeneity. Foundation-model–based feature geometry exhibits cross-domain transferability, which can be exploited to calibrate distributions under privacy constraints and imbalanced data.

Method: Extract feature geometry from off-the-shelf vision foundation models (e.g., CLIP, DINOv2). In federated learning, infer the global geometric shape under privacy constraints and use it to synthesize new client samples to bridge local-global gaps. In long-tailed recognition, transfer geometric knowledge from data-rich classes to recover the true distribution for tail classes, via distribution calibration driven by geometry.

Result: Empirical evaluations show that the proposed geometric knowledge-guided distribution calibration mitigates information deficits caused by data heterogeneity and sampling imbalance, yielding boosted performance across benchmarks in both federated learning and long-tailed recognition.

Conclusion: Geometric knowledge-guided distribution calibration effectively leverages transferable feature geometry from foundation-model features to bridge distribution gaps, enhance cross-domain transfer, and improve performance in challenging settings characterized by privacy constraints and long-tailed data.

Abstract: Despite the fast progress of deep learning, one standing challenge is the gap
of the observed training samples and the underlying true distribution. There
are multiple reasons for the causing of this gap e.g. sampling bias, noise etc.
In the era of foundation models, we show that when leveraging the off-the-shelf
(vision) foundation models (e.g., CLIP, DINOv2) for feature extraction, the
geometric shapes of the resulting feature distributions exhibit remarkable
transferability across domains and datasets. To verify its practical
usefulness, we embody our geometric knowledge-guided distribution calibration
framework in two popular and challenging settings: federated learning and
long-tailed recognition. In the federated setting, we devise a technique of
acquiring the global geometric shape under privacy constraints, then leverage
this knowledge to generate new samples for clients, in the aim of bridging the
gap between local and global observations. In long-tailed learning, it utilizes
the geometric knowledge transferred from sample-rich categories to recover the
true distribution for sample-scarce tail classes. Comprehensive experiments
show that our proposed geometric knowledge-guided distribution calibration
effectively overcomes information deficits caused by data heterogeneity and
sample imbalance, with boosted performance across benchmarks.

### [33] [Evaluating Open-Source Vision Language Models for Facial Emotion Recognition against Traditional Deep Learning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13524)
*Vamsi Krishna Mulukutla,Sai Supriya Pavarala,Srinivasa Raju Rudraraju,Sridevi Bonthu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Open-source vision-language models underperform traditional CNNs on FER-2013; a GFPGAN-based restoration pipeline helps but CNNs (notably EfficientNet-B0 and ResNet-50) still achieve higher accuracy; the study provides a reproducible benchmark and cost analysis to guide deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess whether current VLMs can handle noisy, low-resolution FER data and establish a fair benchmark against strong CNN baselines.

Method: Evaluate Phi-3.5 Vision, CLIP, VGG19, ResNet-50, EfficientNet-B0 on FER-2013; integrate GFPGAN image restoration to mitigate noise; measure precision, recall, F1-score, accuracy; analyze preprocessing/training/inference/evaluation costs.

Result: CNNs outperform VLMs on FER-2013 with Acceptable numbers: EfficientNet-B0 86.44%, ResNet-50 85.72%; CLIP 64.07%, Phi-3.5 Vision 51.66%; highlighting limitations of VLMs in noisy low-quality data; GFPGAN helps but not enough to close the gap.

Conclusion: VLMs need adaptation for noisy FER tasks; the work calls for robust VLM training or specialized pipelines for low-quality data and provides a reproducible benchmark to guide future improvements.

Abstract: Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) is crucial for applications such as
human-computer interaction and mental health diagnostics. This study presents
the first empirical comparison of open-source Vision-Language Models (VLMs),
including Phi-3.5 Vision and CLIP, against traditional deep learning models
VGG19, ResNet-50, and EfficientNet-B0 on the challenging FER-2013 dataset,
which contains 35,887 low-resolution grayscale images across seven emotion
classes. To address the mismatch between VLM training assumptions and the noisy
nature of FER data, we introduce a novel pipeline that integrates GFPGAN-based
image restoration with FER evaluation. Results show that traditional models,
particularly EfficientNet-B0 (86.44%) and ResNet-50 (85.72%), significantly
outperform VLMs like CLIP (64.07%) and Phi-3.5 Vision (51.66%), highlighting
the limitations of VLMs in low-quality visual tasks. In addition to performance
evaluation using precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy, we provide a
detailed computational cost analysis covering preprocessing, training,
inference, and evaluation phases, offering practical insights for deployment.
This work underscores the need for adapting VLMs to noisy environments and
provides a reproducible benchmark for future research in emotion recognition.

### [34] [EAvatar: Expression-Aware Head Avatar Reconstruction with Generative Geometry Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13537)
*Shikun Zhang,Cunjian Chen,Yiqun Wang,Qiuhong Ke,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduce EAvatar, a 3DGS-based head reconstruction framework with sparse expression control and 3D-prior guidance, yielding better local deformations, texture detail, and convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D Gaussian Splatting methods struggle to capture fine-grained facial expressions and preserve local texture continuity in highly deformable head regions, limiting high-fidelity head avatars.

Method: Proposes a sparse expression control mechanism where a few key Gaussians influence neighboring Gaussians to model local deformations; leverages high-quality 3D priors from pretrained generative models to provide reliable facial geometry that guides training and improves convergence stability.

Result: Experiments show improved accuracy, visual coherence, expression controllability, and detail fidelity compared to baselines.

Conclusion: EAvatar effectively combines sparse expression control with 3D priors to advance high-fidelity, controllable head avatar reconstruction using 3D Gaussian Splatting.

Abstract: High-fidelity head avatar reconstruction plays a crucial role in AR/VR,
gaming, and multimedia content creation. Recent advances in 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) have demonstrated effectiveness in modeling complex geometry
with real-time rendering capability and are now widely used in high-fidelity
head avatar reconstruction tasks. However, existing 3DGS-based methods still
face significant challenges in capturing fine-grained facial expressions and
preserving local texture continuity, especially in highly deformable regions.
To mitigate these limitations, we propose a novel 3DGS-based framework termed
EAvatar for head reconstruction that is both expression-aware and
deformation-aware. Our method introduces a sparse expression control mechanism,
where a small number of key Gaussians are used to influence the deformation of
their neighboring Gaussians, enabling accurate modeling of local deformations
and fine-scale texture transitions. Furthermore, we leverage high-quality 3D
priors from pretrained generative models to provide a more reliable facial
geometry, offering structural guidance that improves convergence stability and
shape accuracy during training. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method produces more accurate and visually coherent head reconstructions with
improved expression controllability and detail fidelity.

### [35] [FLAIR: Frequency- and Locality-Aware Implicit Neural Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13544)
*Sukhun Ko,Dahyeon Kye,Kyle Min,Chanho Eom,Jihyong Oh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FLAIR introduces RC-GAUSS and WEGE to give implicit neural representations explicit frequency selectivity, locality, and sparsity, addressing spectral bias and improving 2D/3D tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: INRs currently lack frequency selectivity, spatial localization, and sparse representations, leading to spectral bias toward low frequencies and poor high-frequency detail capture.

Method: Two innovations: RC-GAUSS activation for explicit frequency selection and spatial localization under the time-frequency uncertainty principle; WEGE (Wavelet-Energy-Guided Encoding) uses discrete wavelet transform to compute energy scores and explicitly guide frequency information to the network.

Result: Consistently outperforms existing INRs in 2D image representation and restoration, and in 3D reconstruction.

Conclusion: FLAIR effectively addresses frequency selectivity and locality shortcomings of INRs, enabling better representations and broad applicability across vision tasks.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) leverage neural networks to map
coordinates to corresponding signals, enabling continuous and compact
representations. This paradigm has driven significant advances in various
vision tasks. However, existing INRs lack frequency selectivity, spatial
localization, and sparse representations, leading to an over-reliance on
redundant signal components. Consequently, they exhibit spectral bias, tending
to learn low-frequency components early while struggling to capture fine
high-frequency details. To address these issues, we propose FLAIR (Frequency-
and Locality-Aware Implicit Neural Representations), which incorporates two key
innovations. The first is RC-GAUSS, a novel activation designed for explicit
frequency selection and spatial localization under the constraints of the
time-frequency uncertainty principle (TFUP). The second is
Wavelet-Energy-Guided Encoding (WEGE), which leverages the discrete wavelet
transform (DWT) to compute energy scores and explicitly guide frequency
information to the network. Our method consistently outperforms existing INRs
in 2D image representation and restoration, as well as 3D reconstruction.

*Farhaan Ebadulla,Chiraag Mudlapur,Gaurav BV*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Software-only gaze prediction for VR foveated rendering (GazeProphet) using a Spherical Vision Transformer and an LSTM temporal encoder, achieving a median angular error of 3.83° and 24% improvement over saliency baselines, with confidence estimates and robust performance across scenes, enabling hardware-free adoption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the high computational load of foveated rendering and the barrier of expensive eye-tracking hardware. Seeks to enable practical, hardware-free gaze prediction for VR to broaden adoption across platforms and applications.

Method: A three-part architecture: (1) Spherical Vision Transformer to process 360° VR scenes, (2) LSTM-based temporal encoder to capture gaze sequence dynamics, (3) a multi-modal fusion network that combines spatial scene features with temporal gaze dynamics to predict future gaze locations with confidence estimates. Trained and evaluated on a comprehensive VR dataset, with statistical significance testing.

Result: Median angular error of 3.83°, 24% improvement over traditional saliency baselines, reliable confidence calibration, consistent performance across spatial regions and scene types, statistically significant improvements across evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that software-only gaze prediction is viable for VR foveated rendering, reducing hardware requirements and broadening platform/app applicability while providing actionable confidence estimates for rendering pipelines.

Abstract: Foveated rendering significantly reduces computational demands in virtual
reality applications by concentrating rendering quality where users focus their
gaze. Current approaches require expensive hardware-based eye tracking systems,
limiting widespread adoption due to cost, calibration complexity, and hardware
compatibility constraints. This paper presents GazeProphet, a software-only
approach for predicting gaze locations in VR environments without requiring
dedicated eye tracking hardware. The approach combines a Spherical Vision
Transformer for processing 360-degree VR scenes with an LSTM-based temporal
encoder that captures gaze sequence patterns. A multi-modal fusion network
integrates spatial scene features with temporal gaze dynamics to predict future
gaze locations with associated confidence estimates. Experimental evaluation on
a comprehensive VR dataset demonstrates that GazeProphet achieves a median
angular error of 3.83 degrees, outperforming traditional saliency-based
baselines by 24% while providing reliable confidence calibration. The approach
maintains consistent performance across different spatial regions and scene
types, enabling practical deployment in VR systems without additional hardware
requirements. Statistical analysis confirms the significance of improvements
across all evaluation metrics. These results show that software-only gaze
prediction can work for VR foveated rendering, making this performance boost
more accessible to different VR platforms and apps.

*Zihan Zhang,Shanzhi Yin,Bolin Chen,Ru-Ling Liao,Shiqi Wang,Yan Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Lightweight GFVC using dual-mode optimization reduces model size and compute by ~90% while preserving perceptual quality, outperforming VVC; enables mobile deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GFVC offers high rate-distortion performance via deep generative models but suffers from large parameter counts and heavy computation, hindering practical deployment. A lightweight, efficient framework is needed without sacrificing perceptual quality.

Method: Architectural slimming by replacing 3x3 convolutions with slimmer, more efficient layers, reducing complexity while maintaining expressiveness. A two-stage adaptive channel pruning strategy: (1) soft pruning during training using learnable thresholds to identify redundant channels, (2) hard pruning post-training using a derived mask to permanently remove those channels, ensuring training stability and fast inference.

Result: The approach achieves 90.4% parameter reduction and 88.9% computation savings versus the baseline and delivers superior perceptual-quality performance compared to the state-of-the-art VVC standard.

Conclusion: The dual-mode optimization enables efficient GFVC suitable for deployment on resource-constrained devices. Further details on datasets, baselines, and broader evaluation would help assess generalization and practicality.

Abstract: Generative Face Video Coding (GFVC) achieves superior rate-distortion
performance by leveraging the strong inference capabilities of deep generative
models. However, its practical deployment is hindered by large model parameters
and high computational costs. To address this, we propose a lightweight GFVC
framework that introduces dual-mode optimization - combining architectural
redesign and operational refinement - to reduce complexity whilst preserving
reconstruction quality. Architecturally, we replace traditional 3 x 3
convolutions with slimmer and more efficient layers, reducing complexity
without compromising feature expressiveness. Operationally, we develop a
two-stage adaptive channel pruning strategy: (1) soft pruning during training
identifies redundant channels via learnable thresholds, and (2) hard pruning
permanently eliminates these channels post-training using a derived mask. This
dual-phase approach ensures both training stability and inference efficiency.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed lightweight dual-mode
optimization for GFVC can achieve 90.4% parameter reduction and 88.9%
computation saving compared to the baseline, whilst achieving superior
performance compared to state-of-the-art video coding standard Versatile Video
Coding (VVC) in terms of perceptual-level quality metrics. As such, the
proposed method is expected to enable efficient GFVC deployment in
resource-constrained environments such as mobile edge devices.

### [38] [Color Spike Data Generation via Bio-inspired Neuron-like Encoding with an Artificial Photoreceptor Layer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13558)
*Hsieh Ching-Teng,Wang Yuan-Kai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Biologically inspired neuron-like spike encoding with a photoreceptor layer to carry color and luminance, boosting spike information content and SNN performance while staying neuromorphic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SNNs lag CNNs due to limited spike information; need to enhance information content of spike-based data without abandoning spike-based neuromorphic processing.

Method: Introduce a Neuron-like Encoding method guided by biological neurons and incorporate an artificial photoreceptor layer to encode color and luminance into spike data; validate with Integrate-and-Fire neuron models.

Result: Spike data become richer in information and SNN performance improves, while maintaining neuromorphic principles.

Conclusion: The approach shows strong potential to advance neuromorphic computing and broaden SNN applications; further development could help overcome current limitations.

Abstract: In recent years, neuromorphic computing and spiking neural networks (SNNs)
have ad-vanced rapidly through integration with deep learning. However, the
performance of SNNs still lags behind that of convolutional neural networks
(CNNs), primarily due to the limited information capacity of spike-based data.
Although some studies have attempted to improve SNN performance by training
them with non-spiking inputs such as static images, this approach deviates from
the original intent of neuromorphic computing, which emphasizes spike-based
information processing. To address this issue, we propose a Neuron-like
Encoding method that generates spike data based on the intrinsic operational
principles and functions of biological neurons. This method is further enhanced
by the incorporation of an artificial pho-toreceptor layer, enabling spike data
to carry both color and luminance information, thereby forming a complete
visual spike signal. Experimental results using the Integrate-and-Fire neuron
model demonstrate that this biologically inspired approach effectively
increases the information content of spike signals and improves SNN
performance, all while adhering to neuromorphic principles. We believe this
concept holds strong potential for future development and may contribute to
overcoming current limitations in neuro-morphic computing, facilitating broader
applications of SNNs.

### [39] [DictAS: A Framework for Class-Generalizable Few-Shot Anomaly Segmentation via Dictionary Lookup](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13560)
*Zhen Qu,Xian Tao,Xinyi Gong,ShiChen Qu,Xiaopei Zhang,Xingang Wang,Fei Shen,Zhengtao Zhang,Mukesh Prasad,Guiguang Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DictAS proposes a dictionary-based, self-supervised framework for few-shot anomaly segmentation (FSAS) that enables cross-category anomaly detection in unseen object categories without retraining, using only normal reference images as visual prompts. It builds a dictionary from normal features, performs sparse dictionary lookup for query features to identify anomalies, and uses discrimination regularization (contrastive query constraint and text alignment) to improve anomaly detection. It achieves state-of-the-art performance across seven datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current FSAS methods relying on seen anomaly samples or prior knowledge struggle to generalize to unseen categories. There is a need for zero-shot or few-shot cross-category anomaly detection without retraining. DictAS aims to transfer dictionary lookup capabilities to FSAS through self-supervised learning, using only normal references as prompts to detect anomalies in unseen classes.

Method: (1) Dictionary Construction: build a dictionary from features of normal reference images to simulate index/content of a real dictionary. (2) Dictionary Lookup: retrieve query region features from the dictionary via a sparse lookup; if a query cannot be retrieved, classify as anomaly. (3) Query Discrimination Regularization: enhance anomaly discrimination by making abnormal features harder to retrieve; include Contrastive Query Constraint and Text Alignment Constraint to enforce discriminative querying.

Result: Extensive experiments on seven public industrial and medical datasets show that DictAS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FSAS methods.

Conclusion: DictAS provides a unified model for detecting visual anomalies in unseen object categories without retraining on target data, leveraging a self-supervised dictionary-lookup mechanism guided by normal references and enhanced by discrimination regularization; it achieves strong cross-category anomaly detection performance across diverse datasets.

Abstract: Recent vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) have demonstrated remarkable
class-generalizable ability to unseen classes in few-shot anomaly segmentation
(FSAS), leveraging supervised prompt learning or fine-tuning on seen classes.
However, their cross-category generalization largely depends on prior knowledge
of real seen anomaly samples. In this paper, we propose a novel framework,
namely DictAS, which enables a unified model to detect visual anomalies in
unseen object categories without any retraining on the target data, only
employing a few normal reference images as visual prompts. The insight behind
DictAS is to transfer dictionary lookup capabilities to the FSAS task for
unseen classes via self-supervised learning, instead of merely memorizing the
normal and abnormal feature patterns from the training set. Specifically,
DictAS mainly consists of three components: (1) **Dictionary Construction** -
to simulate the index and content of a real dictionary using features from
normal reference images. (2) **Dictionary Lookup** - to retrieve queried region
features from the dictionary via a sparse lookup strategy. When a query feature
cannot be retrieved, it is classified as an anomaly. (3) **Query Discrimination
Regularization**- to enhance anomaly discrimination by making abnormal features
harder to retrieve from the dictionary. To achieve this, Contrastive Query
Constraint and Text Alignment Constraint are further proposed. Extensive
experiments on seven public industrial and medical datasets demonstrate that
DictAS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FSAS methods.

### [40] [Learnable SMPLify: A Neural Solution for Optimization-Free Human Pose Inverse Kinematics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13562)
*Yuchen Yang,Linfeng Dong,Wei Wang,Zhihang Zhong,Xiao Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Learnable SMPLify replaces SMPLify's iterative IK with a single-pass neural regression, achieving ~200x speedups while maintaining accuracy and generalization. It uses temporal data construction, a human-centric normalization, and residual learning. It supports sequential inference and plug-in post-processing and generalizes to unseen data; code available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SMPLify's IK optimization is computationally expensive, limiting practicality. A fast, data-driven alternative is desirable to enable real-time or large-scale pose estimation while preserving accuracy and generalization.

Method: Replace iterative fitting with a single-pass regression model. Construct training data via a temporal sampling strategy that generates initialization-target pairs from sequential frames. Apply a human-centered normalization and residual learning to constrain the solution space and improve generalization. Support sequential inference and plug-in post-processing; model-agnostic to other image-based estimators.

Result:  achieves nearly 200x faster runtime than SMPLify; generalizes to unseen 3DPW and RICH; effective as a plug-in on LucidAction; code released at the provided GitHub link.

Conclusion: Learnable SMPLify demonstrates that a well-designed neural IK approach can dramatically accelerate 3D pose and shape estimation without sacrificing performance, offering a practical, simple baseline and broad applicability across datasets and systems.

Abstract: In 3D human pose and shape estimation, SMPLify remains a robust baseline that
solves inverse kinematics (IK) through iterative optimization. However, its
high computational cost limits its practicality. Recent advances across domains
have shown that replacing iterative optimization with data-driven neural
networks can achieve significant runtime improvements without sacrificing
accuracy. Motivated by this trend, we propose Learnable SMPLify, a neural
framework that replaces the iterative fitting process in SMPLify with a
single-pass regression model. The design of our framework targets two core
challenges in neural IK: data construction and generalization. To enable
effective training, we propose a temporal sampling strategy that constructs
initialization-target pairs from sequential frames. To improve generalization
across diverse motions and unseen poses, we propose a human-centric
normalization scheme and residual learning to narrow the solution space.
Learnable SMPLify supports both sequential inference and plug-in
post-processing to refine existing image-based estimators. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method establishes itself as a practical and
simple baseline: it achieves nearly 200x faster runtime compared to SMPLify,
generalizes well to unseen 3DPW and RICH, and operates in a model-agnostic
manner when used as a plug-in tool on LucidAction. The code is available at

### [41] [Generative Model-Based Feature Attention Module for Video Action Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13565)
*Guiqin Wang,Peng Zhao,Cong Zhao,Jing Huang,Siyan Guo,Shusen Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A generative attention-based model learns feature semantics in video features to improve action recognition and detection for IoT, addressing the shortcomings of proposal-centric methods; it leverages foreground/background differences to capture frame- and segment-level temporal semantics and demonstrates strong results on recognition and detection benchmarks with code available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video action analysis methods often ignore feature semantics during feature extraction and emphasize action proposals, which undermines precision in high-performance IoT applications (e.g., autonomous driving) that require robust, scalable video analytics.

Method: Introduce a generative attention-based model that learns relations among feature semantics. The approach uses foreground-background differences to jointly capture frame- and segment-level dependencies of temporal action features, thereby making feature semantics more effective in feature extraction.

Result: Extensive experiments on action recognition and action detection show superiority, particularly in action detection datasets; the method generalizes to recognition tasks as well. Code is publicly available.

Conclusion: The model effectively leverages feature semantics to enhance temporal action feature representations, offering robust, scalable video analytics for IoT; demonstrated success across recognition and detection tasks with open-source code.

Abstract: Video action analysis is a foundational technology within the realm of
intelligent video comprehension, particularly concerning its application in
Internet of Things(IoT). However, existing methodologies overlook feature
semantics in feature extraction and focus on optimizing action proposals, thus
these solutions are unsuitable for widespread adoption in high-performance IoT
applications due to the limitations in precision, such as autonomous driving,
which necessitate robust and scalable intelligent video analytics analysis. To
address this issue, we propose a novel generative attention-based model to
learn the relation of feature semantics. Specifically, by leveraging the
differences of actions' foreground and background, our model simultaneously
learns the frame- and segment-dependencies of temporal action feature
semantics, which takes advantage of feature semantics in the feature extraction
effectively. To evaluate the effectiveness of our model, we conduct extensive
experiments on two benchmark video task, action recognition and action
detection. In the context of action detection tasks, we substantiate the
superiority of our approach through comprehensive validation on widely
recognized datasets. Moreover, we extend the validation of the effectiveness of
our proposed method to a broader task, video action recognition. Our code is
available at https://github.com/Generative-Feature-Model/GAF.

*Ruixin Zhang,Jiaqing Fan,Yifan Liao,Qian Qiao,Fanzhang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A Temporal-Conditional Referring Video Object Segmentation (TCRVOS) model that uses a text-to-video diffusion feature extractor, removes the traditional noise predictor to reduce randomness, and introduces a Temporal Context Mask Refinement (TCMR) module to enhance boundary segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art results on four RVOS benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RVOS work emphasizes feature extraction and temporal modeling but largely neglects segmentation-head design, particularly boundary handling. There is room to improve segmentation quality by refining the segmentation head and by leveraging diffusion-based feature extraction to mitigate limitations of VAEs.

Method: Propose Temporal-Conditional Referring Video Object Segmentation model that integrates existing segmentation methods to boost boundary segmentation. Employ a text-to-video diffusion model for feature extraction and remove the noise-prediction module to simplify the model and reduce randomness. Introduce Temporal Context Mask Refinement (TCMR) to address VAE feature- extraction limits without adding substantial complexity.

Result: Consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance on four public RVOS benchmarks.

Conclusion: The approach shows that focusing on segmentation-head design, aided by diffusion-based features and a lightweight TCMR module, yields substantial gains in boundary accuracy and overall RVOS performance, validating the design choices and simplifications.

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment specific objects
in a video according to textual descriptions. We observe that recent RVOS
approaches often place excessive emphasis on feature extraction and temporal
modeling, while relatively neglecting the design of the segmentation head. In
fact, there remains considerable room for improvement in segmentation head
design. To address this, we propose a Temporal-Conditional Referring Video
Object Segmentation model, which innovatively integrates existing segmentation
methods to effectively enhance boundary segmentation capability. Furthermore,
our model leverages a text-to-video diffusion model for feature extraction. On
top of this, we remove the traditional noise prediction module to avoid the
randomness of noise from degrading segmentation accuracy, thereby simplifying
the model while improving performance. Finally, to overcome the limited feature
extraction capability of the VAE, we design a Temporal Context Mask Refinement
(TCMR) module, which significantly improves segmentation quality without
introducing complex designs. We evaluate our method on four public RVOS
benchmarks, where it consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance.

### [43] [Bridging Clear and Adverse Driving Conditions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13592)
*Yoel Shapiro,Yahia Showgan,Koustav Mullick*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hybrid data-generation pipeline that converts clear-weather images to adverse conditions (fog, rain, snow, night) using simulated data, GAN-based models, and diffusion-GAN hybrids; leverages both synthetic paired data and real images to boost AD perception under challenging conditions, showing gains on ACDC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous driving systems perform poorly in adverse weather; adverse-condition data is underrepresented and costly to collect/annotate. A sim-to-real bridging approach using diverse data-generation pipelines can improve robustness by training on synthetic adverse images that are aligned with labeled clear images.

Method: Develop and evaluate multiple pipelines (simulation-only, GAN-based, hybrid diffusion-GAN) to synthesize photorealistic adverse-weather imagery from labeled clear-weather images. Extend an existing DA GAN with auxiliary inputs, adopt a training recipe using both simulated and real data, mitigate diffusion hallucinations by adaptive blending with progenitor images, and fine-tune downstream models on synthetic data. Evaluate on ACDC.

Result: Achieves 1.85% absolute improvement in semantic segmentation overall, and 4.62% improvement for nighttime scenes, demonstrating the effectiveness of the hybrid approach in enhancing robust AD perception under adverse conditions.

Conclusion: A hybrid data-generation framework that combines simulated supervision with real data, and mitigates diffusion artifacts, can substantially improve AD perception in adverse conditions, validating the strategy of leveraging diverse synthetic data to address data scarcity in challenging environments.

Abstract: Autonomous Driving (AD) systems exhibit markedly degraded performance under
adverse environmental conditions, such as low illumination and precipitation.
The underrepresentation of adverse conditions in AD datasets makes it
challenging to address this deficiency. To circumvent the prohibitive cost of
acquiring and annotating adverse weather data, we propose a novel Domain
Adaptation (DA) pipeline that transforms clear-weather images into fog, rain,
snow, and nighttime images. Here, we systematically develop and evaluate
several novel data-generation pipelines, including simulation-only, GAN-based,
and hybrid diffusion-GAN approaches, to synthesize photorealistic adverse
images from labelled clear images. We leverage an existing DA GAN, extend it to
support auxiliary inputs, and develop a novel training recipe that leverages
both simulated and real images. The simulated images facilitate exact
supervision by providing perfectly matched image pairs, while the real images
help bridge the simulation-to-real (sim2real) gap. We further introduce a
method to mitigate hallucinations and artifacts in Stable-Diffusion
Image-to-Image (img2img) outputs by blending them adaptively with their
progenitor images. We finetune downstream models on our synthetic data and
evaluate them on the Adverse Conditions Dataset with Correspondences (ACDC). We
achieve 1.85 percent overall improvement in semantic segmentation, and 4.62
percent on nighttime, demonstrating the efficacy of our hybrid method for
robust AD perception under challenging conditions.

*Jinyoung Park,Minseok Son,Changick Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MaMe is a token-merging strategy for SSM-based vision models that uses the state-transition parameter Δ as an informativeness measure to prune/merge tokens while preserving sequential information, achieving strong efficiency with robustness and generalization to video and audio.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve computational efficiency of state space models in vision without sacrificing their sequential modeling capabilities, addressing that token reduction can disrupt temporal dynamics; need a reliable token-importance criterion and sequencing-preserving merge strategy.

Method: Proposes MaMe, a token-merging approach that leverages the state transition parameter Δ as a measure of token informativeness and uses carefully arranged token patterns to maintain sequential information flow during merging; validated on fine-tuned and off-the-shelf SSM-based models; evaluated across vision tasks and other modalities.

Result: MaMe achieves superior efficiency-accuracy trade-offs, remains robust under aggressive token reduction where other methods fail, and generalizes to video and audio domains, demonstrating broad applicability.

Conclusion: MaMe provides an effective, generalizable toolkit for efficient SSM-based processing across domains by grounding token importance in state transitions and preserving sequence structure, enabling scalable deployment of SSMs.

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as powerful architectures in computer
vision, yet improving their computational efficiency remains crucial for
practical and scalable deployment.While token reduction serves as an effective
approach for model efficiency, applying it to SSMs requires careful
consideration of their unique sequential modeling capabilities.In this work, we
propose MaMe, a token-merging strategy tailored for SSM-based vision
models.MaMe addresses two key challenges: quantifying token importance and
preserving sequential properties. Our approach leverages the state transition
parameter $\mathbf{\Delta}$ as an informativeness measure and introduces
strategic token arrangements to preserve sequential information flow.Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MaMe achieves superior efficiency-performance
trade-offs for both fine-tuned and off-the-shelf models. Particularly, our
approach maintains robustness even under aggressive token reduction where
existing methods undergo significant performance degradation.Beyond image
classification, MaMe shows strong generalization capabilities across video and
audio domains, establishing an effective approach for enhancing efficiency in
diverse SSM applications.

*Shiyuan Chen,Wei Sui,Bohao Zhang,Zeyd Boukhers,John See,Cong Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FoundationSSC introduces dual decoupling at source and pathway levels to separate semantic and geometric priors, plus an Axis-Aware Fusion module, achieving state-of-the-art SSC on SemanticKITTI and KITTI-360.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing camera-based 3D SSC methods rely on a single coupled encoder that forces a trade-off between semantic and geometric performance. Decoupling priors and refining them through specialized pathways can yield stronger, disentangled inputs for 3D feature generation.

Method: Two-stage decoupling: (1) source-level foundation encoder provides semantic feature priors for the semantic branch and high-fidelity stereo cost volumes for the geometric branch; (2) pathway-level specialized, decoupled branches refine these priors to improve semantic context and depth distributions. A hybrid view transformation generates complementary 3D features, and an Axis-Aware Fusion module anisotropically fuses features into a unified representation.

Result: Experiments show simultaneous gains in semantic and geometric metrics: +0.23 mIoU and +2.03 IoU on SemanticKITTI; state-of-the-art on SSCBench-KITTI-360 with 21.78 mIoU and 48.61 IoU.

Conclusion: Dual decoupling with specialized pathways and the Axis-Aware Fusion yields disentangled, refined inputs and a robust fused representation, delivering strong improvements in SSC performance. Code will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Camera-based 3D semantic scene completion (SSC) provides dense geometric and
semantic perception for autonomous driving and robotic navigation. However,
existing methods rely on a coupled encoder to deliver both semantic and
geometric priors, which forces the model to make a trade-off between
conflicting demands and limits its overall performance. To tackle these
challenges, we propose FoundationSSC, a novel framework that performs dual
decoupling at both the source and pathway levels. At the source level, we
introduce a foundation encoder that provides rich semantic feature priors for
the semantic branch and high-fidelity stereo cost volumes for the geometric
branch. At the pathway level, these priors are refined through specialised,
decoupled pathways, yielding superior semantic context and depth distributions.
Our dual-decoupling design produces disentangled and refined inputs, which are
then utilised by a hybrid view transformation to generate complementary 3D
features. Additionally, we introduce a novel Axis-Aware Fusion (AAF) module
that addresses the often-overlooked challenge of fusing these features by
anisotropically merging them into a unified representation. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the advantages of FoundationSSC, achieving simultaneous
improvements in both semantic and geometric metrics, surpassing prior bests by
+0.23 mIoU and +2.03 IoU on SemanticKITTI. Additionally, we achieve
state-of-the-art performance on SSCBench-KITTI-360, with 21.78 mIoU and 48.61
IoU. The code will be released upon acceptance.

Motivation: Growing demand for short, personalized videos; existing methods rely on predefined scripts, lacking dynamism and personal expression; need an automated, multimodal, customizable Vlog system with efficient content creation.

Method: Multi-agent collaboration framework with Multimodal LLMs to generate high-quality prompts for multimodal content creation based on user input; feedback and rollback mechanism using MLLMs for iterative self-correction; outputs include videos, background music, and inner monologue; theme and reference image as input; ThemeVlogEval framework for standardized metrics/datasets for fair evaluation.

Result: Comprehensive experiments show significant advantages over several baselines, demonstrating the framework's effectiveness and potential.

Conclusion: Automated, personalized multimodal Vlog generation is feasible and promising; PersonaVlog improves efficiency and creativity, and ThemeVlogEval provides a standardized benchmarking pathway.

Abstract: With the growing demand for short videos and personalized content, automated
Video Log (Vlog) generation has become a key direction in multimodal content
creation. Existing methods mostly rely on predefined scripts, lacking dynamism
and personal expression. Therefore, there is an urgent need for an automated
Vlog generation approach that enables effective multimodal collaboration and
high personalization. To this end, we propose PersonaVlog, an automated
multimodal stylized Vlog generation framework that can produce personalized
Vlogs featuring videos, background music, and inner monologue speech based on a
given theme and reference image. Specifically, we propose a multi-agent
collaboration framework based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). This
framework efficiently generates high-quality prompts for multimodal content
creation based on user input, thereby improving the efficiency and creativity
of the process. In addition, we incorporate a feedback and rollback mechanism
that leverages MLLMs to evaluate and provide feedback on generated results,
thereby enabling iterative self-correction of multimodal content. We also
propose ThemeVlogEval, a theme-based automated benchmarking framework that
provides standardized metrics and datasets for fair evaluation. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate the significant advantages and potential of our
framework over several baselines, highlighting its effectiveness and great

Motivation: Fill the gap in IoT-based face mask detection and secure entry; enhance security and convenience with two-factor authentication and remote monitoring.

Method: Employ Local Binary Patterns Histograms (LBPH) for full-face recognition and a modified LBPH variant for occluded faces; integrate a second factor via passcode verification; deploy on Raspberry Pi with Telegram-based remote control and automatic owner alerts and surveillance activation.

Result: Achieved approximately 70% accuracy, 80% precision, and 83.26% recall across tested users; demonstrated capability to perform face recognition and mask-related detection, automate remote control operations to register users, lock/unlock the door, and notify the owner; sample participants showed high acceptance for future testing.

Conclusion: Shows feasibility of integrating face recognition with passcode-based two-factor authentication in IoT entry systems; results indicate moderate performance with potential for improvement through larger-scale testing, more robust occlusion handling, and enhanced security measures.

Abstract: Face mask detection has become increasingly important recently, particularly
during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many face detection models have been developed in
smart entryways using IoT. However, there is a lack of IoT development on face
mask detection. This paper proposes a two-factor authentication system for
smart entryway access control using facial recognition and passcode
verification and an automation process to alert the owner and activate the
surveillance system when a stranger is detected and controls the system
remotely via Telegram on a Raspberry Pi platform. The system employs the Local
Binary Patterns Histograms for the full face recognition algorithm and modified
LBPH algorithm for occluded face detection. On average, the system achieved an
Accuracy of approximately 70%, a Precision of approximately 80%, and a Recall
of approximately 83.26% across all tested users. The results indicate that the
system is capable of conducting face recognition and mask detection, automating
the operation of the remote control to register users, locking or unlocking the
door, and notifying the owner. The sample participants highly accept it for
future use in the user acceptance test.

TL;DR: TalkVid introduces a large-scale, diverse talking-head dataset (1244 hours, 7729 speakers) and TalkVid-Bench evaluation set (500 clips). It improves cross-dataset generalization for audio-driven synthesis and reveals subgroup disparities that aggregate metrics miss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the generalization gap in audio-driven talking head synthesis due to limited diversity in training data; need scalable, high-quality, diverse data to cover ethnicity, language, and age.

Method: Develop a multi-stage automated pipeline to curate TalkVid, applying filters for motion stability, aesthetics, and facial detail; validate with human judgments; release a stratified evaluation set TalkVid-Bench balanced across demographics and languages.

Result: Models trained on TalkVid outperform ones trained on prior datasets, showing better cross-dataset generalization; TalkVid-Bench reveals performance disparities across subgroups obscured by aggregate metrics.

Conclusion: Diverse, high-quality datasets and balanced benchmarks are essential to understand and improve generalization; dataset release will facilitate fairer evaluation and highlight biases; call for ongoing research with such benchmarks.

Abstract: Audio-driven talking head synthesis has achieved remarkable photorealism, yet
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models exhibit a critical failure: they lack
generalization to the full spectrum of human diversity in ethnicity, language,
and age groups. We argue that this generalization gap is a direct symptom of
limitations in existing training data, which lack the necessary scale, quality,
and diversity. To address this challenge, we introduce TalkVid, a new
large-scale, high-quality, and diverse dataset containing 1244 hours of video
from 7729 unique speakers. TalkVid is curated through a principled, multi-stage
automated pipeline that rigorously filters for motion stability, aesthetic
quality, and facial detail, and is validated against human judgments to ensure
its reliability. Furthermore, we construct and release TalkVid-Bench, a
stratified evaluation set of 500 clips meticulously balanced across key
demographic and linguistic axes. Our experiments demonstrate that a model
trained on TalkVid outperforms counterparts trained on previous datasets,
exhibiting superior cross-dataset generalization. Crucially, our analysis on
TalkVid-Bench reveals performance disparities across subgroups that are
obscured by traditional aggregate metrics, underscoring its necessity for
future research. Code and data can be found in

TL;DR: RGB-only category-level pose estimation using a transformer and geometric feature guidance, with RANSAC-PnP for pose; claims efficiency and accuracy gains over RGB-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcomes lack of depth data in real-world scenes; enables category-level pose estimation without depth.

Method: Transformer-based network predicting and fusing geometric features; geometric feature-guided algorithm to ensure faithful geometry representation; RANSAC-PnP for pose with scale variation handling.

Result: Benchmark results show high efficiency and superior accuracy compared to previous RGB-based methods.

Conclusion: RGB-only RGB-based category-level pose estimation is viable and promising; introduces new perspective.

Abstract: While most current RGB-D-based category-level object pose estimation methods
achieve strong performance, they face significant challenges in scenes lacking
depth information. In this paper, we propose a novel category-level object pose
estimation approach that relies solely on RGB images. This method enables
accurate pose estimation in real-world scenarios without the need for depth
data. Specifically, we design a transformer-based neural network for
category-level object pose estimation, where the transformer is employed to
predict and fuse the geometric features of the target object. To ensure that
these predicted geometric features faithfully capture the object's geometry, we
introduce a geometric feature-guided algorithm, which enhances the network's
ability to effectively represent the object's geometric information. Finally,
we utilize the RANSAC-PnP algorithm to compute the object's pose, addressing
the challenges associated with variable object scales in pose estimation.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach is not
only highly efficient but also achieves superior accuracy compared to previous
RGB-based methods. These promising results offer a new perspective for
advancing category-level object pose estimation using RGB images.

Motivation: The performance of conditional diffusion with CFG is highly sensitive to guidance weight due to a training-inference gap that accumulates error during inference; reducing this gap should improve sample quality and robustness.

Method: Introduce DiffIER, a plug-and-play optimization framework that iteratively minimizes inference-time error at each denoising step, reducing accumulated error and enabling guidance-weight robustness.

Result: Empirical experiments show DiffIER outperforms baselines in conditional generation tasks and generalizes across text-to-image synthesis, image super-resolution, and text-to-speech, indicating versatility.

Conclusion: Addressing the training-inference gap with stepwise error minimization yields more reliable high-quality generation across multiple domains, with a lightweight, modular optimization approach.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating
high-quality samples and enhancing performance across diverse domains through
Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG). However, the quality of generated samples is
highly sensitive to the selection of the guidance weight. In this work, we
identify a critical ``training-inference gap'' and we argue that it is the
presence of this gap that undermines the performance of conditional generation
and renders outputs highly sensitive to the guidance weight. We quantify this
gap by measuring the accumulated error during the inference stage and establish
a correlation between the selection of guidance weight and minimizing this gap.
Furthermore, to mitigate this gap, we propose DiffIER, an optimization-based
method for high-quality generation. We demonstrate that the accumulated error
can be effectively reduced by an iterative error minimization at each step
during inference. By introducing this novel plug-and-play optimization
framework, we enable the optimization of errors at every single inference step
and enhance generation quality. Empirical results demonstrate that our proposed
method outperforms baseline approaches in conditional generation tasks.
Furthermore, the method achieves consistent success in text-to-image
generation, image super-resolution, and text-to-speech generation, underscoring
its versatility and potential for broad applications in future research.

### [51] [OmniTry: Virtual Try-On Anything without Masks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13632)
*Yutong Feng,Linlin Zhang,Hengyuan Cao,Yiming Chen,Xiaoduan Feng,Jian Cao,Yuxiong Wu,Bin Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniTry is a unified VTON framework extending to wearable objects with a mask-free approach, using a two-stage learning pipeline (unpaired localization via inpainting-based object placement, then fine-tuning with paired data) achieving better localization and ID preservation across 12 wearable classes, with public release planned.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VTON methods largely target garments; there is a need to generalize to diverse wearable items (jewelry, accessories) and to operate in mask-free, practical settings. Data scarcity for paired object-try-on examples across new categories motivates a learning strategy that leverages unpaired data for localization and limited paired data for appearance consistency.

Method: A two-stage pipeline: (1) Stage 1 uses large-scale unpaired portrait images containing wearables to train mask-free localization by repurposing an inpainting model to place objects given an empty mask. (2) Stage 2 fine-tunes the model with paired images to transfer appearance consistency of the objects. The approach claims quick convergence with few paired samples and is evaluated on 12 wearable classes across in-shop and in-the-wild images.

Result: OmniTry demonstrates improved performance in object localization and ID-preservation compared with existing methods on a 12-class wearable benchmark and shows robustness across in-shop and in-the-wild data."

Conclusion: OmniTry extends VTON beyond garments to arbitrary wearables with a practical mask-free setup, offering a scalable two-stage training strategy and broad applicability. The authors plan to release code, model weights, and the evaluation benchmark publicly.

Abstract: Virtual Try-ON (VTON) is a practical and widely-applied task, for which most
of existing works focus on clothes. This paper presents OmniTry, a unified
framework that extends VTON beyond garment to encompass any wearable objects,
e.g., jewelries and accessories, with mask-free setting for more practical
application. When extending to various types of objects, data curation is
challenging for obtaining paired images, i.e., the object image and the
corresponding try-on result. To tackle this problem, we propose a two-staged
pipeline: For the first stage, we leverage large-scale unpaired images, i.e.,
portraits with any wearable items, to train the model for mask-free
localization. Specifically, we repurpose the inpainting model to automatically
draw objects in suitable positions given an empty mask. For the second stage,
the model is further fine-tuned with paired images to transfer the consistency
of object appearance. We observed that the model after the first stage shows
quick convergence even with few paired samples. OmniTry is evaluated on a
comprehensive benchmark consisting of 12 common classes of wearable objects,
with both in-shop and in-the-wild images. Experimental results suggest that
OmniTry shows better performance on both object localization and
ID-preservation compared with existing methods. The code, model weights, and
evaluation benchmark of OmniTry will be made publicly available at
https://omnitry.github.io/.

### [52] [DeH4R: A Decoupled and Hybrid Method for Road Network Graph Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13669)
*Dengxian Gong,Shunping Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeH4R is a hybrid road-network extraction model that decouples vertex detection, adjacent vertex prediction, initial graph construction, and graph expansion to marry graph-generating efficiency with graph-growing dynamics, enabling dynamic vertex/edge insertions and superior topology fidelity with fast inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Segmentation-based methods struggle to preserve topology after vectorization, graph-growing methods are computationally heavy due to iterative ROI cropping, and graph-generating methods predict static global vertices but limit dynamic insertion. There is a need for fast, topology-consistent road graphs that can adaptively insert vertices and edges.

Method: Decoupled pipeline comprising (1) candidate vertex detection, (2) adjacent vertex prediction, (3) initial graph construction, and (4) graph expansion. This architecture enables dynamic vertex and edge insertions while maintaining fast inference and improved topology fidelity and spatial consistency.

Result: On CityScale and SpaceNet benchmarks, DeH4R achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the prior SOTA graph-growing method RNGDet++ by 4.62 APLS and 10.18 IoU on CityScale and running about 10× faster. The authors also indicate code availability at GitHub.

Conclusion: DeH4R successfully combines the benefits of graph-generating efficiency with graph-growing dynamics, enabling dynamic insertion of vertices and edges for topology-faithful, scalable road-network graphs with fast inference; it sets a new SOTA on multiple benchmarks and offers publicly available code.

Abstract: The automated extraction of complete and precise road network graphs from
remote sensing imagery remains a critical challenge in geospatial computer
vision. Segmentation-based approaches, while effective in pixel-level
recognition, struggle to maintain topology fidelity after vectorization
postprocessing. Graph-growing methods build more topologically faithful graphs
but suffer from computationally prohibitive iterative ROI cropping.
Graph-generating methods first predict global static candidate road network
vertices, and then infer possible edges between vertices. They achieve fast
topology-aware inference, but limits the dynamic insertion of vertices. To
address these challenges, we propose DeH4R, a novel hybrid model that combines
graph-generating efficiency and graph-growing dynamics. This is achieved by
decoupling the task into candidate vertex detection, adjacent vertex
prediction, initial graph contruction, and graph expansion. This architectural
innovation enables dynamic vertex (edge) insertions while retaining fast
inference speed and enhancing both topology fidelity and spatial consistency.
Comprehensive evaluations on CityScale and SpaceNet benchmarks demonstrate
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. DeH4R outperforms the prior SOTA
graph-growing method RNGDet++ by 4.62 APLS and 10.18 IoU on CityScale, while
being approximately 10 $\times$ faster. The code will be made publicly
available at https://github.com/7777777FAN/DeH4R.

*Keliang Li,Hongze Shen,Hao Shi,Ruibing Hou,Hong Chang,Jie Huang,Chenghao Jia,Wen Wang,Yiling Wu,Dongmei Jiang,Shiguang Shan,Xilin Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HumanPCR is a comprehensive, human-centric evaluation suite for multimodal models, assessing perception, comprehension, and reasoning with 6k+ human-verified multiple-choice questions and a challenging video reasoning test; results show current models struggle with space, time, and mind modeling, with limited gains from larger contexts or test-time thinking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To push toward human-comparable AGI by focusing on human-related visual contexts and mind modeling, addressing gaps in existing benchmarks that overlook detailed perception, comprehension, and proactive evidence extraction.

Method: Three-tier evaluation: Human-P and Human-C with 6k+ human-verified MCQs across 9 dimensions; Human-R is a manually curated video reasoning test requiring integration of multiple visual evidences and proactive evidence extraction, with each question including human-annotated chain-of-thought rationales and key visual evidence; evaluations cover 30+ state-of-the-art models; analysis identifies major failure modes.

Result: Models show significant gaps in human-centric understanding, especially in detailed space perception, temporal understanding, and mind modeling. In Human-R, models struggle to extract proactive visual evidences and excessively rely on query-guided retrieval; scaling visual context or test-time thinking provides only limited improvements.

Conclusion: The authors aim to advance the development, evaluation, and human-centric application of multimodal models through the HumanPCR suite and the insights it yields.

Abstract: The aspiration for artificial general intelligence, fueled by the rapid
progress of multimodal models, demands human-comparable performance across
diverse environments. We propose HumanPCR, an evaluation suite for probing
MLLMs' capacity about human-related visual contexts across three hierarchical
levels: Perception, Comprehension, and Reasoning (denoted by Human-P, Human-C,
and Human-R, respectively). Human-P and Human-C feature over 6,000
human-verified multiple choice questions, assessing massive tasks of 9
dimensions, including but not limited to essential skills frequently overlooked
by existing benchmarks. Human-R offers a challenging manually curated video
reasoning test that requires integrating multiple visual evidences, proactively
extracting context beyond question cues, and applying human-like expertise.
Each question includes human-annotated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationales with
key visual evidence to support further research. Extensive evaluations on over
30 state-of-the-art models exhibit significant challenges in human-centric
visual understanding, particularly in tasks involving detailed space
perception, temporal understanding, and mind modeling. Moreover, analysis of
Human-R reveals the struggle of models in extracting essential proactive visual
evidence from diverse human scenes and their faulty reliance on query-guided
retrieval. Even with advanced techniques like scaling visual contexts and
test-time thinking yield only limited benefits. We hope HumanPCR and our
findings will advance the development, evaluation, and human-centric
application of multimodal models.

### [54] [Diversity-enhanced Collaborative Mamba for Semi-supervised Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13712)
*Shumeng Li,Jian Zhang,Lei Qi,Luping Zhou,Yinghuan Shi,Yang Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A semi-supervised medical image segmentation method (DCMamba) that uses a diversity-enhanced Mamba framework to exploit unlabeled data through data-level augmentations, network-level diverse-scan collaboration, and feature-level uncertainty-weighted contrastive learning, achieving state-of-the-art gains on Synapse with only 20% labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image segmentation requires large annotated datasets which are costly. Semi-supervised learning can exploit unlabeled data. Incorporating long-range dependencies via state-space models like Mamba may improve modeling of medical images. Introducing diversity across data, network, and features aims to boost pseudo-label quality and representation.

Method: Propose Diversity-enhanced Collaborative Mamba (DCMamba). Data: patch-level weak-strong mixing augmentation aligned with Mamba's scanning dynamics. Network: diverse-scan collaboration module leveraging discrepancies from predictions under different scanning directions. Feature: uncertainty-weighted contrastive learning to diversify feature representations.

Result: Empirical results show DCMamba outperforms existing semi-supervised methods, achieving large gains (e.g., 6.69% on Synapse with 20% labeled data) compared to the latest SSM-based method.

Conclusion: DCMamba demonstrates that explicitly encouraging diversity across data, network behaviors, and feature representations can substantially improve semi-supervised medical image segmentation, highlighting the potential of Mamba-based frameworks for efficient learning with limited labels.

Abstract: Acquiring high-quality annotated data for medical image segmentation is
tedious and costly. Semi-supervised segmentation techniques alleviate this
burden by leveraging unlabeled data to generate pseudo labels. Recently,
advanced state space models, represented by Mamba, have shown efficient
handling of long-range dependencies. This drives us to explore their potential
in semi-supervised medical image segmentation. In this paper, we propose a
novel Diversity-enhanced Collaborative Mamba framework (namely DCMamba) for
semi-supervised medical image segmentation, which explores and utilizes the
diversity from data, network, and feature perspectives. Firstly, from the data
perspective, we develop patch-level weak-strong mixing augmentation with
Mamba's scanning modeling characteristics. Moreover, from the network
perspective, we introduce a diverse-scan collaboration module, which could
benefit from the prediction discrepancies arising from different scanning
directions. Furthermore, from the feature perspective, we adopt an
uncertainty-weighted contrastive learning mechanism to enhance the diversity of
feature representation. Experiments demonstrate that our DCMamba significantly
outperforms other semi-supervised medical image segmentation methods, e.g.,
yielding the latest SSM-based method by 6.69% on the Synapse dataset with 20%
labeled data.

### [55] [Hierarchical Vision-Language Retrieval of Educational Metaverse Content in Agriculture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13713)
*Ali Abdari,Alex Falcon,Giuseppe Serra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces AgriMuseums, a dataset with 457 agricultural-themed virtual museums enriched with textual descriptions, and a hierarchical vision-language model for retrieving relevant museums via natural language queries. Demonstrates strong retrieval performance (R@1 ≈ 62%, MRR ≈ 78%) and gains over existing benchmarks (up to 6% R@1 and 11% MRR); code and data released for further research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As online educational content grows, especially in immersive Metaverse environments, organizing and retrieving relevant experiences is increasingly important. Existing datasets are small, hindering training of advanced models for cross-modal retrieval in agricultural Metaverse contexts. A larger, text-rich dataset and an effective retrieval model are needed to connect natural language queries with immersive AgriMuseums.

Method: Create AgriMuseums, a dataset of 457 agricultural-themed virtual museums each with textual descriptions. Propose a hierarchical vision-language retrieval model that represents AgriMuseums and supports retrieval from natural language queries. Evaluate on retrieval tasks, showing improvements over baselines and on existing benchmarks.

Result: The proposed method achieves about 62% R@1 and 78% MRR on retrieval tasks. It also improves existing benchmarks by up to 6% in R@1 and 11% in MRR. Extensive evaluations validate the design choices and effectiveness of the dataset and model.

Conclusion: The combination of a large, text-enriched AgriMuseum dataset and a hierarchical vision-language retrieval model advances search and personalization within agricultural Metaverse content, enabling more effective discovery of relevant immersive educational experiences. Code and dataset are released for reproducibility and future work.

Abstract: Every day, a large amount of educational content is uploaded online across
different areas, including agriculture and gardening. When these videos or
materials are grouped meaningfully, they can make learning easier and more
effective. One promising way to organize and enrich such content is through the
Metaverse, which allows users to explore educational experiences in an
interactive and immersive environment. However, searching for relevant
Metaverse scenarios and finding those matching users' interests remains a
challenging task. A first step in this direction has been done recently, but
existing datasets are small and not sufficient for training advanced models. In
this work, we make two main contributions: first, we introduce a new dataset
containing 457 agricultural-themed virtual museums (AgriMuseums), each enriched
with textual descriptions; and second, we propose a hierarchical
vision-language model to represent and retrieve relevant AgriMuseums using
natural language queries. In our experimental setting, the proposed method
achieves up to about 62\% R@1 and 78\% MRR, confirming its effectiveness, and
it also leads to improvements on existing benchmarks by up to 6\% R@1 and 11\%
MRR. Moreover, an extensive evaluation validates our design choices. Code and
dataset are available at

### [56] [Enhancing Targeted Adversarial Attacks on Large Vision-Language Models through Intermediate Projector Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13739)
*Yiming Cao,Yanjie Li,Kaisheng Liang,Yuni Lai,Bin Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes IPGA, an attack on Vision-Language Models that targets the intermediate projector (Q-Former) to enable fine-grained, token-level adversarial perturbations, with Residual Query Alignment to preserve unrelated content, yielding stronger and more transferable attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing attacks collapse visual information into a single global encoder representation and largely ignore the projector, hindering granular control and full exploitation of the VLM pipeline.

Method: Attack the Q-Former intermediary to convert global image embeddings into fine-grained visual tokens; employ the Q-Former pretrained on the first vision-language alignment stage without fine-tuning the LLM; introduce Residual Query Alignment to preserve unrelated visual content and enable precise perturbations.

Result: IPGA outperforms prior methods on both standard image captioning and fine-grained VQA tasks in black-box settings and transfers to multiple commercial VLMs, including Google Gemini and OpenAI GPT.

Conclusion: Targeting the projector stage unlocks precise, transferable adversarial control over VLMs, revealing weaknesses in the vision-language alignment pipeline and guiding robustness-focused defenses.

Abstract: Targeted adversarial attacks are essential for proactively identifying
security flaws in Vision-Language Models before real-world deployment. However,
current methods perturb images to maximize global similarity with the target
text or reference image at the encoder level, collapsing rich visual semantics
into a single global vector. This limits attack granularity, hindering
fine-grained manipulations such as modifying a car while preserving its
background. Furthermore, these methods largely overlook the projector module, a
critical semantic bridge between the visual encoder and the language model in
VLMs, thereby failing to disrupt the full vision-language alignment pipeline
within VLMs and limiting attack effectiveness. To address these issues, we
propose the Intermediate Projector Guided Attack (IPGA), the first method to
attack using the intermediate stage of the projector module, specifically the
widely adopted Q-Former, which transforms global image embeddings into
fine-grained visual features. This enables more precise control over
adversarial perturbations by operating on semantically meaningful visual tokens
rather than a single global representation. Specifically, IPGA leverages the
Q-Former pretrained solely on the first vision-language alignment stage,
without LLM fine-tuning, which improves both attack effectiveness and
transferability across diverse VLMs. Furthermore, we propose Residual Query
Alignment (RQA) to preserve unrelated visual content, thereby yielding more
controlled and precise adversarial manipulations. Extensive experiments show
that our attack method consistently outperforms existing methods in both
standard global image captioning tasks and fine-grained visual
question-answering tasks in black-box environment. Additionally, IPGA
successfully transfers to multiple commercial VLMs, including Google Gemini and
OpenAI GPT.

### [57] [Mitigating Cross-Image Information Leakage in LVLMs for Multi-Image Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13744)
*Yeji Park,Minyoung Lee,Sanghyuk Chun,Junsuk Choe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FOCUS is a training-free decoding strategy that reduces cross-image information leakage in LVLMs during multi-image inference by masking all but one image with noise, aggregating logits across masked contexts, and contrastively refining with a noise-only reference input to improve multi-image reasoning without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-image inputs cause cross-image information leakage, where cues from different images entangle in the model's output. A training-free, architecture-agnostic method is sought to improve multi-image reasoning across LVLMs.

Method: During inference, sequentially mask all but one image with random noise to force the model to base its logits on a single clean image. Repeat for all target images to obtain logits under partially masked contexts. Aggregate these logits across images and apply a contrastive refinement using a noise-only reference input to suppress leakage and produce more accurate outputs.

Result: FOCUS consistently yields improvements on four multi-image benchmarks across diverse LVLM families.

Conclusion: FOCUS provides a general, practical solution for enhancing multi-image reasoning without additional training or architectural changes.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate strong performance on
single-image tasks. However, we observe that their performance degrades
significantly when handling multi-image inputs. This occurs because visual cues
from different images become entangled in the model's output. We refer to this
phenomenon as cross-image information leakage. To address this issue, we
propose FOCUS, a training-free and architecture-agnostic decoding strategy that
mitigates cross-image information leakage during inference. FOCUS sequentially
masks all but one image with random noise, guiding the model to focus on the
single clean image. We repeat this process across all target images to obtain
logits under partially masked contexts. These logits are aggregated and then
contrastively refined using a noise-only reference input, which suppresses the
leakage and yields more accurate outputs. FOCUS consistently improves
performance across four multi-image benchmarks and diverse LVLM families. This
demonstrates that FOCUS offers a general and practical solution for enhancing
multi-image reasoning without additional training or architectural
modifications.

### [58] [Shape-from-Template with Generalised Camera](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13791)
*Agniva Sengupta,Stefan Zachow*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A generalized-camera Shape-from-Template (SfT) framework for non-rigid 3D registration from multiple cameras; proposes three formulations (known point direction, unknown point with known orientation, and silhouette-based) solved via convex programming and iterative refinement; validated on synthetic and real data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extend non-rigid 3D registration from single-view SfT to multi-view settings to exploit cross-view constraints and broaden applications such as medical imaging and handheld camera capture.

Method: Model the multi-camera setup with a generalized camera model. Propose three SfT formulations: (i) correspondences lie on a direction from a known 3D point; (ii) correspondences lie on a direction from an unknown 3D point with known orientation in a local frame; (iii) include silhouette information of the object. The first two are solved via convex programming, while the silhouette-based approach is an iterative refinement initialized by the convex solutions. The methods leverage mutual constraints across multiple views to improve reconstruction accuracy.

Result: Demonstrates improved reconstruction accuracy by exploiting multi-view constraints; shows accurate registration on both synthetic and real data, and establishes a first set of SfT solutions for generalized cameras.

Conclusion: This work presents the first set of SfT solutions with generalized cameras, enabling non-rigid 3D registration from multi-view observations. The use of convex formulations and silhouette refinement improves robustness and accuracy, broadening SfT applicability to diverse camera models and deformable objects.

Abstract: This article presents a new method for non-rigidly registering a 3D shape to
2D keypoints observed by a constellation of multiple cameras. Non-rigid
registration of a 3D shape to observed 2D keypoints, i.e., Shape-from-Template
(SfT), has been widely studied using single images, but SfT with information
from multiple-cameras jointly opens new directions for extending the scope of
known use-cases such as 3D shape registration in medical imaging and
registration from hand-held cameras, to name a few. We represent such
multi-camera setup with the generalised camera model; therefore any collection
of perspective or orthographic cameras observing any deforming object can be
registered. We propose multiple approaches for such SfT: the first approach
where the corresponded keypoints lie on a direction vector from a known 3D
point in space, the second approach where the corresponded keypoints lie on a
direction vector from an unknown 3D point in space but with known orientation
w.r.t some local reference frame, and a third approach where, apart from
correspondences, the silhouette of the imaged object is also known. Together,
these form the first set of solutions to the SfT problem with generalised
cameras. The key idea behind SfT with generalised camera is the improved
reconstruction accuracy from estimating deformed shape while utilising the
additional information from the mutual constraints between multiple views of a
deformed object. The correspondence-based approaches are solved with convex
programming while the silhouette-based approach is an iterative refinement of
the results from the convex solutions. We demonstrate the accuracy of our
proposed methods on many synthetic and real data

### [59] [VisionLaw: Inferring Interpretable Intrinsic Dynamics from Visual Observations via Bilevel Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13792)
*Jailing Lin,Shu Jiang,Qingyuan Zeng,Zhenzhong Wang,Min Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisionLaw introduces a bilevel framework that infers interpretable intrinsic dynamics from visual observations by using an LLM-driven decoupled constitutive evolution at the top level and a vision-guided evaluation loop at the bottom, enabling interpretable, generalizable dynamics for interactive simulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches either rely on manually defined constitutive priors (which struggle to generalize to complex scenarios) or optimize with neural networks (which often lack interpretability and generalization). There is a need for interpretable yet flexible inference of object dynamics purely from visual observations to enable plausible interactive simulation.

Method: A bilevel optimization: (top) LLMs-driven decoupled constitutive evolution where LLMs act as physics experts to generate and revise constitutive laws with a decoupling mechanism to reduce search space; (bottom) vision-guided constitutive evaluation that uses visual simulation to assess how well the generated law matches the intrinsic dynamics, guiding the upper level.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show VisionLaw can infer interpretable intrinsic dynamics from visual observations, outperforming state-of-the-art methods and generalizing well to novel scenarios for interactive simulation.

Conclusion: VisionLaw successfully combines interpretable, physics-informed priors with data-driven visual feedback to infer intrinsic dynamics from visuals, achieving strong generalization and improved plausibility for interactive simulations.

Abstract: The intrinsic dynamics of an object governs its physical behavior in the real
world, playing a critical role in enabling physically plausible interactive
simulation with 3D assets. Existing methods have attempted to infer the
intrinsic dynamics of objects from visual observations, but generally face two
major challenges: one line of work relies on manually defined constitutive
priors, making it difficult to generalize to complex scenarios; the other
models intrinsic dynamics using neural networks, resulting in limited
interpretability and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we
propose VisionLaw, a bilevel optimization framework that infers interpretable
expressions of intrinsic dynamics from visual observations. At the upper level,
we introduce an LLMs-driven decoupled constitutive evolution strategy, where
LLMs are prompted as a knowledgeable physics expert to generate and revise
constitutive laws, with a built-in decoupling mechanism that substantially
reduces the search complexity of LLMs. At the lower level, we introduce a
vision-guided constitutive evaluation mechanism, which utilizes visual
simulation to evaluate the consistency between the generated constitutive law
and the underlying intrinsic dynamics, thereby guiding the upper-level
evolution. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate
that VisionLaw can effectively infer interpretable intrinsic dynamics from
visual observations. It significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods and exhibits strong generalization for interactive simulation in novel
scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Med-CTX is a transformer-based multimodal framework for explainable breast ultrasound segmentation that fuses vision and BI-RADS clinical text, delivering precise masks, uncertainty maps, and diagnostic rationales with strong quantitative results and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve breast ultrasound segmentation while enhancing interpretability by incorporating structured radiology reports and justification for decisions, addressing trust and transparency in AI-based medical imaging.

Method: A dual-branch visual encoder using ViT and Swin transformers with uncertainty-aware fusion; BI-RADS-structured clinical text encoded by BioClinicalBERT and integrated with visual features via cross-modal attention to produce segmentation masks, uncertainty maps, and model-generated rationales.

Result: On BUS-BRA, Dice=99% and IoU=95%, outperforming U-Net, ViT, and Swin baselines. Ablation shows clinical text is crucial (-5.4% Dice, -31% CIDEr). Multimodal alignment (CLIP=85%) and calibration (ECE=3.2%) improve trustworthiness.

Conclusion: Med-CTX demonstrates that multimodal, transformer-based architectures with clinical text integration can achieve high-accuracy segmentation while providing clinically grounded explanations, setting a new standard for trustworthy multimodal medical segmentation.

Abstract: We introduce Med-CTX, a fully transformer based multimodal framework for
explainable breast cancer ultrasound segmentation. We integrate clinical
radiology reports to boost both performance and interpretability. Med-CTX
achieves exact lesion delineation by using a dual-branch visual encoder that
combines ViT and Swin transformers, as well as uncertainty aware fusion.
Clinical language structured with BI-RADS semantics is encoded by
BioClinicalBERT and combined with visual features utilising cross-modal
attention, allowing the model to provide clinically grounded, model generated
explanations. Our methodology generates segmentation masks, uncertainty maps,
and diagnostic rationales all at once, increasing confidence and transparency
in computer assisted diagnosis. On the BUS-BRA dataset, Med-CTX achieves a Dice
score of 99% and an IoU of 95%, beating existing baselines U-Net, ViT, and
Swin. Clinical text plays a key role in segmentation accuracy and explanation
quality, as evidenced by ablation studies that show a -5.4% decline in Dice
score and -31% in CIDEr. Med-CTX achieves good multimodal alignment (CLIP
score: 85%) and increased confi dence calibration (ECE: 3.2%), setting a new
bar for trustworthy, multimodal medical architecture.

### [61] [Timestep-Compressed Attack on Spiking Neural Networks through Timestep-Level Backpropagation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13812)
*Donghwa Kang,Doohyun Kim,Sang-Ki Ko,Jinkyu Lee,Hyeongboo Baek,Brent ByungHoon Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a timestep-compressed attack (TCA) for spiking neural networks to reduce attack latency while preserving effectiveness, by using per-timestep backpropagation and reuse of membrane potential warm-up computations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SNNs incur high attack latency due to multi-timestep processing, limiting real-time adversarial analysis. Existing SOTA attacks extend ANN-based FGSM/PGD methods, but fail to exploit SNN-specific dynamics.

Method: Introduce TCBP (timestep-level backprop) and A-MPR (adversarial membrane potential reuse). TLBP performs backpropagation at each timestep with early stopping, avoiding global temporal backprop. A-MPR pre-computes/reuses warm-up membrane potential from initial timesteps to reduce redundant computation. Evaluations on VGG-11 and ResNet-17 with CIFAR-10/100 and CIFAR10-DVS datasets; compare against SOTA white-box and black-box attacks.

Result: TCA reduces attack latency by up to 56.6% (white-box) and 57.1% (black-box) versus SOTA methods, while maintaining comparable attack success rates.

Conclusion: TCA demonstrates that exploiting SNN-specific temporal dynamics yields substantial speedups in adversarial attacks without sacrificing effectiveness, enabling more practical real-time threat analyses on SNNs.

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) gradient-based adversarial attacks on spiking neural
networks (SNNs), which largely rely on extending FGSM and PGD frameworks, face
a critical limitation: substantial attack latency from multi-timestep
processing, rendering them infeasible for practical real-time applications.
This inefficiency stems from their design as direct extensions of ANN
paradigms, which fail to exploit key SNN properties. In this paper, we propose
the timestep-compressed attack (TCA), a novel framework that significantly
reduces attack latency. TCA introduces two components founded on key insights
into SNN behavior. First, timestep-level backpropagation (TLBP) is based on our
finding that global temporal information in backpropagation to generate
perturbations is not critical for an attack's success, enabling per-timestep
evaluation for early stopping. Second, adversarial membrane potential reuse
(A-MPR) is motivated by the observation that initial timesteps are
inefficiently spent accumulating membrane potential, a warm-up phase that can
be pre-calculated and reused. Our experiments on VGG-11 and ResNet-17 with the
CIFAR-10/100 and CIFAR10-DVS datasets show that TCA significantly reduces the
required attack latency by up to 56.6% and 57.1% compared to SOTA methods in
white-box and black-box settings, respectively, while maintaining a comparable
attack success rate.

*Diaa Addeen Abuhani,Marco Seccaroni,Martina Mazzarello,Imran Zualkernan,Fabio Duarte,Carlo Ratti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Unsupervised clustering integrating street-level visual embeddings with spatial planting patterns to estimate urban biodiversity without labels; yields genus-level diversity patterns across eight North American cities with high fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Municipal canopy inventories are sparse; field inventories are costly; supervised AI lacks generalizability across regions; need scalable, low-cost monitoring.

Method: An unsupervised clustering framework that fuses visual embeddings from street-level imagery with spatial planting patterns to estimate biodiversity without labeled data; applied to eight North American cities; evaluates against ground truth Shannon and Simpson indices; preserves spatial autocorrelation.

Result: Genus-level diversity patterns recovered with high fidelity; low Wasserstein distances to ground truth for Shannon and Simpson indices; spatial autocorrelation preserved across city scales.

Conclusion: This approach enables scalable biodiversity mapping in cities lacking inventories and supports continuous, low-cost monitoring to promote equitable access to greenery and adaptive urban ecosystem management.

Abstract: Urban tree biodiversity is critical for climate resilience, ecological
stability, and livability in cities, yet most municipalities lack detailed
knowledge of their canopies. Field-based inventories provide reliable estimates
of Shannon and Simpson diversity but are costly and time-consuming, while
supervised AI methods require labeled data that often fail to generalize across
regions. We introduce an unsupervised clustering framework that integrates
visual embeddings from street-level imagery with spatial planting patterns to
estimate biodiversity without labels. Applied to eight North American cities,
the method recovers genus-level diversity patterns with high fidelity,
achieving low Wasserstein distances to ground truth for Shannon and Simpson
indices and preserving spatial autocorrelation. This scalable, fine-grained
approach enables biodiversity mapping in cities lacking detailed inventories
and offers a pathway for continuous, low-cost monitoring to support equitable
access to greenery and adaptive management of urban ecosystems.

### [63] [Self-Aware Adaptive Alignment: Enabling Accurate Perception for Intelligent Transportation Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13823)
*Tong Xiang,Hongxia Zhao,Fenghua Zhu,Yuanyuan Chen,Yisheng Lv*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SA3 proposes Self-Aware Adaptive Alignment for cross-domain object detection in intelligent transportation systems. It uses an attention-based image-level alignment module and an instance-to-image alignment module to bridge domain gaps, with channel re-weighting of features feeding a region proposal network to detect salient regions. It reports state-of-the-art results on cross-domain benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-domain object detection in intelligent transportation systems suffers from domain shift between source and target data (e.g., different environments, sensors, weather). There is a need for robust, adaptive alignment mechanisms that can align features at both image and instance levels to improve detection performance across domains.

Method: A two-tier alignment strategy: (1) an attention-based alignment module trained on source and target data to guide image-level feature alignment, enabling local-global adaptive alignment; (2) an instance-to-image alignment module tailored to the target domain to further mitigate domain gaps. Features from both domains are channel-re-weighted and fed into the region proposal network to extract salient region features, enhancing ROI-based detection under domain shift.

Result: Extensive experiments on popular cross-domain object detection benchmarks show that SA3 achieves superior performance compared to previous state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: SA3 demonstrates that combining image-level and instance-level alignments with channel-wise feature weighting and an adaptive recognition strategy yields strong cross-domain detection performance. The approach advances domain adaptation in ITS detection by addressing both global and local (instance) domain gaps.

Abstract: Achieving top-notch performance in Intelligent Transportation detection is a
critical research area. However, many challenges still need to be addressed
when it comes to detecting in a cross-domain scenario. In this paper, we
propose a Self-Aware Adaptive Alignment (SA3), by leveraging an efficient
alignment mechanism and recognition strategy. Our proposed method employs a
specified attention-based alignment module trained on source and target domain
datasets to guide the image-level features alignment process, enabling the
local-global adaptive alignment between the source domain and target domain.
Features from both domains, whose channel importance is re-weighted, are fed
into the region proposal network, which facilitates the acquisition of salient
region features. Also, we introduce an instance-to-image level alignment module
specific to the target domain to adaptively mitigate the domain gap. To
evaluate the proposed method, extensive experiments have been conducted on
popular cross-domain object detection benchmarks. Experimental results show
that SA3 achieves superior results to the previous state-of-the-art methods.

*Paul Grimal,Michaël Soumm,Hervé Le Borgne,Olivier Ferret,Akihiro Sugimoto*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free framework that improves alignment of text prompts in diffusion/flow-based text-to-image generation by explicitly modeling the signal component during denoising, achieving higher fidelity and controllability—including bounding-box conditioning—while remaining compatible with existing architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State-of-the-art T2I models often misalign with prompts, missing critical elements or blending concepts. There is a need for stronger prompt fidelity, fine-grained control, and robustness without additional training.

Method: Learn a high-success-rate distribution conditioned on the target prompt; explicitly model the signal component during the denoising process; compatible with diffusion and flow-matching architectures; supports additional conditioning modalities such as bounding boxes for improved spatial alignment.

Result: Empirical experiments show the method outperforms current state-of-the-art methods; code is released for reproducibility.

Conclusion: A training-free, signal-aware framework enhances prompt fidelity and spatial alignment, integrates with existing architectures, and enables flexible conditioning without retraining.

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image models produce visually impressive results but
often struggle with precise alignment to text prompts, leading to missing
critical elements or unintended blending of distinct concepts. We propose a
novel approach that learns a high-success-rate distribution conditioned on a
target prompt, ensuring that generated images faithfully reflect the
corresponding prompts. Our method explicitly models the signal component during
the denoising process, offering fine-grained control that mitigates
over-optimization and out-of-distribution artifacts. Moreover, our framework is
training-free and seamlessly integrates with both existing diffusion and flow
matching architectures. It also supports additional conditioning modalities --
such as bounding boxes -- for enhanced spatial alignment. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. The

*Daniele Corradetti,José Delgado Rodrigues*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Multi-agent Id-Pattern system simulates collaboration among experts to diagnose stone deterioration from visual evidence, achieving substantial performance gains over a baseline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional expert-driven diagnosis is accurate but time-consuming and resource-intensive; automating collaboration among specialized experts can reduce costs while maintaining or enhancing accuracy.

Method: Develop Id-Pattern within RED.AI as a cognitive-architecture-based multi-agent system with five agents (lithologist, pathologist, environmental expert, conservator-restorer, diagnostic coordinator). It orchestrates agent collaboration to diagnose stone pathologies from images. Evaluation on 28 challenging images with multiple deterioration patterns, comparing against a foundational model.

Result: First results show a huge boost on all metrics relative to the foundational model, indicating strong performance gains from agent-based collaboration.

Conclusion: The multi-agent framework effectively emulates expert teamwork and substantially improves diagnostic ability for stone pathologies from visual evidence, supporting automation in conservation diagnostics; further work may explore larger datasets and expanded agent roles.

Abstract: The Id-Pattern system within the RED.AI project (Reabilita\c{c}\~ao
Estrutural Digital atrav\'es da AI) consists of an agentic system designed to
assist in the identification of stone deterioration patterns. Traditional
methodologies, based on direct observation by expert teams, are accurate but
costly in terms of time and resources. The system developed here introduces and
evaluates a multi-agent artificial intelligence (AI) system, designed to
simulate collaboration between experts and automate the diagnosis of stone
pathologies from visual evidence. The approach is based on a cognitive
architecture that orchestrates a team of specialized AI agents which, in this
specific case, are limited to five: a lithologist, a pathologist, an
environmental expert, a conservator-restorer, and a diagnostic coordinator. To
evaluate the system we selected 28 difficult images involving multiple
deterioration patterns. Our first results showed a huge boost on all metrics of
our system compared to the foundational model.

### [66] [RICO: Two Realistic Benchmarks and an In-Depth Analysis for Incremental Learning in Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13878)
*Matthias Neuwirth-Trapp,Maarten Bieshaar,Danda Pani Paudel,Luc Van Gool*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Realistic Incremental Object Detection benchmarks (RICO) reveal IL methods struggle; small replay beats IL; single-task training still best; code forthcoming.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Incremental learning aims to adapt to new data without full retraining, but real-world performance is unclear because existing benchmarks are synthetic. There is a need for realistic benchmarks in object detection to evaluate resilience to domain shifts and expanding classes.

Method: Introduce two benchmarks: D-RICO with fixed class set across time under domain shifts, and EC-RICO that adds new domains and new classes per IL step. Built from 14 diverse datasets (real and synthetic) with varying conditions (weather, time of day), sensors, perspectives, and labeling policies to capture real-world IL challenges.

Result: All IL methods show poor adaptability and retention. Replaying a small amount of previously seen data outperforms all IL methods. Training on data in isolation remains superior. Distillation performance is weak, single models struggle with task diversity, and limited plasticity contributes to the gap.

Conclusion: Benchmarks reveal limitations of current IL approaches for object detection and highlight the benefits of even small memory replay. This motivates exploring stronger distillation, multi-task capable models, and enhanced plasticity; code will be released publicly.

Abstract: Incremental Learning (IL) trains models sequentially on new data without full
retraining, offering privacy, efficiency, and scalability. IL must balance
adaptability to new data with retention of old knowledge. However, evaluations
often rely on synthetic, simplified benchmarks, obscuring real-world IL
performance. To address this, we introduce two Realistic Incremental Object
Detection Benchmarks (RICO): Domain RICO (D-RICO) features domain shifts with a
fixed class set, and Expanding-Classes RICO (EC-RICO) integrates new domains
and classes per IL step. Built from 14 diverse datasets covering real and
synthetic domains, varying conditions (e.g., weather, time of day), camera
sensors, perspectives, and labeling policies, both benchmarks capture
challenges absent in existing evaluations. Our experiments show that all IL
methods underperform in adaptability and retention, while replaying a small
amount of previous data already outperforms all methods. However, individual
training on the data remains superior. We heuristically attribute this gap to
weak teachers in distillation, single models' inability to manage diverse
tasks, and insufficient plasticity. Our code will be made publicly available.

### [67] [In-hoc Concept Representations to Regularise Deep Learning in Medical Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13880)
*Valentina Corbetta,Floris Six Dijkstra,Regina Beets-Tan,Hoel Kervadec,Kristoffer Wickstrøm,Wilson Silva*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LCRReg uses latent concept representations to regularize CNNs toward concept-aligned latent subspaces using a small auxiliary dataset, improving robustness to distribution shifts and spurious correlations in medical imaging without needing dense concept labels in the main training set; validated on synthetic data and diabetic retinopathy with competitive gains; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical imaging models often exhibit brittle generalization under distribution shifts, relying on spurious correlations rather than clinically meaningful features. LCRReg aims to induce semantically grounded representations by leveraging latent concept representations (e.g., CAVs) without requiring full concept supervision in the main dataset.

Method: Identify predefined relevant concepts and extract latent concept representations (LCRs/CAVs) from a small auxiliary dataset. Introduce a regularization term that encourages the CNN to activate within latent subspaces associated with those concepts. The main training set does not require concept labels; the approach is architecture-agnostic and uses disentangled concept examples synthesized from auxiliary data.

Result: On a controlled toy dataset, LCRReg significantly improves robustness to injected spurious correlations and remains effective in multi-concept and multiclass settings. On diabetic retinopathy binary classification, it improves performance under synthetic spurious perturbations and under out-of-distribution generalisation. It outperforms baselines such as multitask learning, linear probing, and post-hoc concept-based models.

Conclusion: LCRReg provides a lightweight, architecture-agnostic strategy for enhancing robustness to distribution shifts without dense concept supervision. It efficiently leverages latent concept representations to steer learning toward semantically meaningful features. Code is available at the provided GitHub link.

Abstract: Deep learning models in medical imaging often achieve strong in-distribution
performance but struggle to generalise under distribution shifts, frequently
relying on spurious correlations instead of clinically meaningful features. We
introduce LCRReg, a novel regularisation approach that leverages Latent Concept
Representations (LCRs) (e.g., Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs)) to guide
models toward semantically grounded representations. LCRReg requires no concept
labels in the main training set and instead uses a small auxiliary dataset to
synthesise high-quality, disentangled concept examples. We extract LCRs for
predefined relevant features, and incorporate a regularisation term that guides
a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to activate within latent subspaces
associated with those concepts. We evaluate LCRReg across synthetic and
real-world medical tasks. On a controlled toy dataset, it significantly
improves robustness to injected spurious correlations and remains effective
even in multi-concept and multiclass settings. On the diabetic retinopathy
binary classification task, LCRReg enhances performance under both synthetic
spurious perturbations and out-of-distribution (OOD) generalisation. Compared
to baselines, including multitask learning, linear probing, and post-hoc
concept-based models, LCRReg offers a lightweight, architecture-agnostic
strategy for improving model robustness without requiring dense concept
supervision. Code is available at the following link:

### [68] [Forecasting Smog Events Using ConvLSTM: A Spatio-Temporal Approach for Aerosol Index Prediction in South Asia](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13891)
*Taimur Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A ConvLSTM model using Sentinel-5P UV Aerosol Index data can forecast aerosol-related smog events up to five days ahead, achieving MSE ~0.0018, loss ~0.3995, and SSIM ~0.74, indicating promising regional forecasting with room for improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: South Asian smog is a recurring, region-wide problem with significant socio-economic impacts. Real-time, regional forecasts are lacking, and Aerosol Index is key to AQI calculation. This work targets the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) and leverages novel spatiotemporal modeling to improve forecasts.

Method: A ConvLSTM neural network trained on Sentinel-5P aerosol data (2019–2023). The Ultraviolet Aerosol Index (340–380 nm) is used as the predictor to forecast aerosol events at five-day intervals. Performance is evaluated via MSE (~0.0018), loss (~0.3995), and SSIM (~0.74).

Result: The ConvLSTM model can forecast the Aerosol Index at five-day intervals with the reported metrics, demonstrating effectiveness in capturing spatial-temporal dependencies. The approach shows potential for real-time regional forecasting but requires additional data sources and architectural refinements to enhance accuracy and reliability.

Conclusion: ConvLSTM-based forecasting of Aerosol Index is a promising step toward regional smog forecasting for the IGP. Further improvements—such as integrating extra data streams and refining model architecture—could enhance predictive performance and operational viability.

Abstract: The South Asian Smog refers to the recurring annual air pollution events
marked by high contaminant levels, reduced visibility, and significant
socio-economic impacts, primarily affecting the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) from
November to February. Over the past decade, increased air pollution sources
such as crop residue burning, motor vehicles, and changing weather patterns
have intensified these smog events. However, real-time forecasting systems for
increased particulate matter concentrations are still not established at
regional scale. The Aerosol Index, closely tied to smog formation and a key
component in calculating the Air Quality Index (AQI), reflects particulate
matter concentrations. This study forecasts aerosol events using Sentinel-5P
air constituent data (2019-2023) and a Convolutional Long-Short Term Memory
(ConvLSTM) neural network, which captures spatial and temporal correlations
more effectively than previous models. Using the Ultraviolet (UV) Aerosol Index
at 340-380 nm as the predictor, results show the Aerosol Index can be
forecasted at five-day intervals with a Mean Squared Error of ~0.0018, loss of
~0.3995, and Structural Similarity Index of ~0.74. While effective, the model
can be improved by integrating additional data and refining its architecture.

### [69] [SCRNet: Spatial-Channel Regulation Network for Medical Ultrasound Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13899)
*Weixin Xu,Ziliang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCRNet combines feature aggregation (FAM) and spatial–channel regulation (SCRM) to merge convolution and cross-attention, addressing local and long-range cues in ultrasound segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNNs tend to neglect long-range dependencies while Transformers can overlook local context; medical ultrasound segmentation benefits from jointly modeling both types of information. The paper proposes modules to fuse these capabilities within a UNet framework.

Method: A two-input feature system feeds into two branches of a Convolution and Cross-Attention Parallel Module (CCAPM) via a Feature Aggregation Module (FAM) to instantiate different roles in each branch. This merges local convolutions with cross-attention to capture both long-range and local cues. The Spatial-Channel Regulation Module (SCRM) enhances salient-region and informative-feature selection and is integrated into the UNet encoder to form the Spatial-Channel Regulation Network (SCRNet).

Result: Extensive experiments show SCRNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on medical ultrasound image segmentation compared with existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed SCRNet effectively balances long-range dependencies and local context by fusing CNN and transformer-like mechanisms, offering a robust framework for ultrasound segmentation and a template for broader medical image tasks.

Abstract: Medical ultrasound image segmentation presents a formidable challenge in the
realm of computer vision. Traditional approaches rely on Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based methods to address the intricacies of
medical image segmentation. Nevertheless, inherent limitations persist, as
CNN-based methods tend to disregard long-range dependencies, while
Transformer-based methods may overlook local contextual information. To address
these deficiencies, we propose a novel Feature Aggregation Module (FAM)
designed to process two input features from the preceding layer. These features
are seamlessly directed into two branches of the Convolution and
Cross-Attention Parallel Module (CCAPM) to endow them with different roles in
each of the two branches to help establish a strong connection between the two
input features. This strategy enables our module to focus concurrently on both
long-range dependencies and local contextual information by judiciously merging
convolution operations with cross-attention mechanisms. Moreover, by
integrating FAM within our proposed Spatial-Channel Regulation Module (SCRM),
the ability to discern salient regions and informative features warranting
increased attention is enhanced. Furthermore, by incorporating the SCRM into
the encoder block of the UNet architecture, we introduce a novel framework
dubbed Spatial-Channel Regulation Network (SCRNet). The results of our
extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of SCRNet, which consistently
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared to existing methods.

*Chunji Lv,Zequn Chen,Donglin Di,Weinan Zhang,Hao Li,Wei Chen,Changsheng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A fast, single-image 4D motion synthesis method (PhysGM) that jointly predicts a 3D Gaussian representation and physics, enabling real-time physics-enabled rendering, aided by a new dataset and DPO-based training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current physics-grounded 3D motion synthesis relies on pre-reconstructed 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and either inflexible, manually defined physical attributes or heavy optimization via video-model guidance, leading to limited flexibility and slow training/inference.

Method: A feed-forward framework that jointly predicts a 3D Gaussian representation and its physical properties from a single image; first train a base model optimizing Gaussian reconstruction and probabilistic physics prediction, then refine with physically plausible reference videos; replace SDS-based optimization with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align simulations with reference videos; introduce PhysAssets, a dataset with 24k+ 3D assets annotated with physical properties and guiding videos.

Result: The method can generate high-fidelity 4D simulations from a single image in about one minute, representing a significant speedup over prior works while maintaining realistic rendering and physics-driven fidelity.

Conclusion: PhysGM enables immediate, physics-consistent 4D rendering from a single image with fast inference; the approach reduces reliance on gradient-heavy SDS and adds a scalable dataset (PhysAssets) to support training and evaluation.

Abstract: While physics-grounded 3D motion synthesis has seen significant progress,
current methods face critical limitations. They typically rely on
pre-reconstructed 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representations, while physics
integration depends on either inflexible, manually defined physical attributes
or unstable, optimization-heavy guidance from video models. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce PhysGM, a feed-forward framework that jointly predicts
a 3D Gaussian representation and its physical properties from a single image,
enabling immediate, physical simulation and high-fidelity 4D rendering. We
first establish a base model by jointly optimizing for Gaussian reconstruction
and probabilistic physics prediction. The model is then refined with physically
plausible reference videos to enhance both rendering fidelity and physics
prediction accuracy. We adopt the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align
its simulations with reference videos, circumventing Score Distillation
Sampling (SDS) optimization which needs back-propagating gradients through the
complex differentiable simulation and rasterization. To facilitate the
training, we introduce a new dataset PhysAssets of over 24,000 3D assets,
annotated with physical properties and corresponding guiding videos.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively generates
high-fidelity 4D simulations from a single image in one minute. This represents
a significant speedup over prior works while delivering realistic rendering
results. Our project page is at:https://hihixiaolv.github.io/PhysGM.github.io/

### [71] [DIME-Net: A Dual-Illumination Adaptive Enhancement Network Based on Retinex and Mixture-of-Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13921)
*Ziang Wang,Xiaoqin Wang,Dingyi Wang,Qiang Li,Shushan Qiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DIME-Net proposes a dual-illumination enhancement framework that uses a sparse-gated Mixture-of-Experts illumination estimator to adaptively select S-curve experts guided by Retinex theory, coupled with an illumination-aware damage restoration module featuring advanced attention mechanisms, trained on a hybrid MixBL dataset. It achieves competitive results on synthetic and real low-light and backlit images without requiring retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing illumination enhancement methods typically handle a single type of lighting degradation, failing to robustly address diverse real-world conditions (e.g., low-light and backlit) within one framework. There is a need for a unified, adaptable solution that improves image quality and downstream tasks across varied illumination while being trainable in one process.

Method: A Mixture-of-Experts illumination estimator with a sparse gating mechanism adaptively selects suitable S-curve expert networks based on input illumination. Retinex theory-informed enhancement is used. A damage restoration module with Illumination-Aware Cross Attention and Sequential-State Global Attention corrects illumination artifacts and color distortions. A hybrid MixBL dataset combines existing datasets to enable robust illumination adaptability in a single training process.

Result: Experimental results indicate DIME-Net achieves competitive performance on both synthetic and real-world low-light and backlit datasets, demonstrating strong generalization and potential for practical multimedia applications under diverse illumination, even without retraining on new datasets.

Conclusion: DIME-Net provides a unified, generalizable approach to dual-illumination enhancement by combining adaptive expert gating, Retinex-guided enhancement, and illumination-aware restoration. It shows robust performance across varied lighting conditions and holds promise for real-world multimedia use, with a single-training pipeline thanks to MixBL.

Abstract: Image degradation caused by complex lighting conditions such as low-light and
backlit scenarios is commonly encountered in real-world environments,
significantly affecting image quality and downstream vision tasks. Most
existing methods focus on a single type of illumination degradation and lack
the ability to handle diverse lighting conditions in a unified manner. To
address this issue, we propose a dual-illumination enhancement framework called
DIME-Net. The core of our method is a Mixture-of-Experts illumination estimator
module, where a sparse gating mechanism adaptively selects suitable S-curve
expert networks based on the illumination characteristics of the input image.
By integrating Retinex theory, this module effectively performs enhancement
tailored to both low-light and backlit images. To further correct
illumination-induced artifacts and color distortions, we design a damage
restoration module equipped with Illumination-Aware Cross Attention and
Sequential-State Global Attention mechanisms. In addition, we construct a
hybrid illumination dataset, MixBL, by integrating existing datasets, allowing
our model to achieve robust illumination adaptability through a single training
process. Experimental results show that DIME-Net achieves competitive
performance on both synthetic and real-world low-light and backlit datasets
without any retraining. These results demonstrate its generalization ability
and potential for practical multimedia applications under diverse and complex
illumination conditions.

*Andrea Atzori,Fadi Boutros,Naser Damer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViT-FIQA introduces a Vision Transformer-based FIQA model that adds a learnable quality token to the input sequence to predict a scalar face-utility score, while using patch-token features for discriminative face representations. It achieves top-tier FIQA performance across CNN- and ViT-based FR models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Face image quality assessment for recognition; existing FIQA work is CNN-centric and may underexploit global context. Vision Transformers offer strong context modeling and scalability, motivating a ViT-based FIQA approach.

Method: Extend ViT backbones with a learnable quality token concatenated to image patch tokens. Process the sequence with global self-attention. Use two heads: (1) patch-token features passed through a fully connected layer with a margin-penalty softmax loss to learn discriminative face representations; (2) the quality token fed to a regression head to predict the image utility score.

Result: Extensive experiments on challenging FIQA benchmarks and multiple FR models (both CNN- and ViT-based) show ViT-FIQA achieving top-tier performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of transformer-based architectures for modeling face image utility and supporting ViTs as a scalable foundation for FIQA research.

Conclusion: ViT-FIQA demonstrates that ViTs can effectively model face image utility through a learnable quality token, offering strong performance across FR backbones and highlighting transformers as a promising foundation for future FIQA research.

Abstract: Face Image Quality Assessment (FIQA) aims to predict the utility of a face
image for face recognition (FR) systems. State-of-the-art FIQA methods mainly
rely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), leaving the potential of Vision
Transformer (ViT) architectures underexplored. This work proposes ViT-FIQA, a
novel approach that extends standard ViT backbones, originally optimized for
FR, through a learnable quality token designed to predict a scalar utility
score for any given face image. The learnable quality token is concatenated
with the standard image patch tokens, and the whole sequence is processed via
global self-attention by the ViT encoders to aggregate contextual information
across all patches. At the output of the backbone, ViT-FIQA branches into two
heads: (1) the patch tokens are passed through a fully connected layer to learn
discriminative face representations via a margin-penalty softmax loss, and (2)
the quality token is fed into a regression head to learn to predict the face
sample's utility. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks and several
FR models, including both CNN- and ViT-based architectures, demonstrate that
ViT-FIQA consistently achieves top-tier performance. These results underscore
the effectiveness of transformer-based architectures in modeling face image
utility and highlight the potential of ViTs as a scalable foundation for future
FIQA research https://cutt.ly/irHlzXUC.

### [73] [RotBench: Evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models on Identifying Image Rotation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13968)
*Tianyi Niu,Jaemin Cho,Elias Stengel-Eskin,Mohit Bansal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RotBench reveals a notable gap in Multimodal LLMs' ability to correctly identify image orientation beyond simple 0° and 180° cues; models struggle to distinguish 90° vs 270° and rely on contextual cues that are not robust to rotation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess the robustness of MLLMs' visual reasoning with respect to image rotation, a fundamental perceptual cue for spatial understanding, across diverse image types.

Method: Introduce RotBench, a 350-image manually-filtered benchmark (lifestyle, portrait, landscape) with images rotated at 0°, 90°, 180°, 270°. Evaluate multiple open and proprietary MLLMs (e.g., GPT-5, o3, Gemini-2.5-Pro). Test with auxiliary information (captions, depth maps), chain-of-thought prompts, and different setups (concurrent rotations, voting). Also assess fine-tuning effects on rotation discrimination.

Result: Most models reliably identify 0°; some identify 180°; 90° vs 270° remain indistinguishable. Auxiliary information and chain-of-thought offer small/inconsistent gains. Rotating inputs in parallel boosts reasoning models modestly; voting helps weaker models. Fine-tuning improves 180° detection but not 90°/270° discrimination.

Conclusion: There is a substantial gap between MLLMs and human perception in rotation identification. Current approaches offer limited mitigation through prompts, auxiliary data, or fine-tuning, indicating the need for more robust spatial reasoning capabilities in MLLMs.

Abstract: We investigate to what extent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can
accurately identify the orientation of input images rotated 0{\deg}, 90{\deg},
180{\deg}, and 270{\deg}. This task demands robust visual reasoning
capabilities to detect rotational cues and contextualize spatial relationships
within images, regardless of their orientation. To evaluate MLLMs on these
abilities, we introduce RotBench -- a 350-image manually-filtered benchmark
comprising lifestyle, portrait, and landscape images. Despite the relatively
simple nature of this task, we show that several state-of-the-art open and
proprietary MLLMs, including GPT-5, o3, and Gemini-2.5-Pro, do not reliably
identify rotation in input images. Providing models with auxiliary information
-- including captions, depth maps, and more -- or using chain-of-thought
prompting offers only small and inconsistent improvements. Our results indicate
that most models are able to reliably identify right-side-up (0{\deg}) images,
while certain models are able to identify upside-down (180{\deg}) images. None
can reliably distinguish between 90{\deg} and 270{\deg}. Simultaneously showing
the image rotated in different orientations leads to moderate performance gains
for reasoning models, while a modified setup using voting improves the
performance of weaker models. We further show that fine-tuning does not improve
models' ability to distinguish 90{\deg} and 270{\deg} rotations, despite
substantially improving the identification of 180{\deg} images. Together, these
results reveal a significant gap between MLLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities

Abstract: Depth estimation is a fundamental task for 3D scene understanding in
autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality. Existing depth datasets,
such as KITTI, nuScenes, and DDAD, have advanced the field but suffer from
limitations in diversity and scalability. As benchmark performance on these
datasets approaches saturation, there is an increasing need for a new
generation of large-scale, diverse, and cost-efficient datasets to support the
era of foundation models and multi-modal learning. To address these challenges,
we introduce a large-scale, diverse, frame-wise continuous dataset for depth
estimation in dynamic outdoor driving environments, comprising 20K video frames
to evaluate existing methods. Our lightweight acquisition pipeline ensures
broad scene coverage at low cost, while sparse yet statistically sufficient
ground truth enables robust training. Compared to existing datasets, ours
presents greater diversity in driving scenarios and lower depth density,
creating new challenges for generalization. Benchmark experiments with standard
monocular depth estimation models validate the dataset's utility and highlight
substantial performance gaps in challenging conditions, establishing a new
platform for advancing depth estimation research.

*Aayush Rana,Akash Kumar,Vibhav Vineet,Yogesh S Rawat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A study proposes adaptive annotation for video action detection: uses an active learning strategy to select the appropriate annotation type per video and a 3D-superpixel method to generate pseudo-labels for training, reducing labeling cost with minimal performance loss on UCF101-24 and JHMDB-21.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video action detection requires dense annotations which are expensive; real-world videos vary in difficulty and may not need uniform annotation granularity. The work seeks to optimize annotation type per sample and leverage weak/partial labels for training.

Method: 1) An active learning strategy to estimate the necessary annotation type for each video. 2) A spatio-temporal 3D-superpixel approach to generate pseudo-labels from the available annotations (tags, points, scribbles, boxes, masks) for training a detector.

Result: Annotation costs are significantly reduced with only minimal loss in detection performance on UCF101-24 and JHMDB-21, demonstrating effective training with mixed annotation types.

Conclusion: Adaptive annotation and 3D-superpixel pseudo-labeling enable cost-efficient spatio-temporal video action detection, making real-world deployment more practical by matching annotation effort to sample difficulty.

Abstract: Video action detection requires dense spatio-temporal annotations, which are
both challenging and expensive to obtain. However, real-world videos often vary
in difficulty and may not require the same level of annotation. This paper
analyzes the appropriate annotation types for each sample and their impact on
spatio-temporal video action detection. It focuses on two key aspects: 1) how
to obtain varying levels of annotation for videos, and 2) how to learn action
detection from different annotation types. The study explores video-level tags,
points, scribbles, bounding boxes, and pixel-level masks. First, a simple
active learning strategy is proposed to estimate the necessary annotation type
for each video. Then, a novel spatio-temporal 3D-superpixel approach is
introduced to generate pseudo-labels from these annotations, enabling effective
training. The approach is validated on UCF101-24 and JHMDB-21 datasets,
significantly cutting annotation costs with minimal performance loss.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing demand in logistics for safe, scalable pallet handling and automation; environmental and cost pressures motivate eco-friendly packaging and reduced reliance on physical crash tests; need for flexible, accurate simulators to evaluate a wide range of configurations.

*Edoardo Palladin,Samuel Brucker,Filippo Ghilotti,Praveen Narayanan,Mario Bijelic,Felix Heide*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces a sparse 3D feature encoding with self-supervised pretraining to push perception to 250 m for highway driving, achieving significant gains in object detection and LiDAR forecasting over BEV-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-range highway driving requires perception ranges around 250 m to provide adequate planning and braking margins. BEV representations scale poorly with distance due to memory and compute costs, hindering deployment for large vehicles like trucks that require longer planning horizons.

Method: Builds on a sparse representation and introduces an efficient 3D encoding of multi-modal and temporal features, complemented by a self-supervised pre-training scheme to learn from unlabeled camera-LiDAR data, enabling extended perception distances beyond traditional BEV approaches.

Result: Extends perception distances to 250 meters and achieves a 26.6% improvement in mAP for object detection and a 30.5% reduction in Chamfer Distance for LiDAR forecasting compared with existing methods.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that long-range perception (up to 250 m) is feasible using sparse 3D encoding and self-supervised learning, addressing BEV limitations and enabling safer deployment for high-speed intercity highway autonomy, including large trucks; invites further work on real-world robustness and efficiency.

Abstract: Outside of urban hubs, autonomous cars and trucks have to master driving on
intercity highways. Safe, long-distance highway travel at speeds exceeding 100
km/h demands perception distances of at least 250 m, which is about five times
the 50-100m typically addressed in city driving, to allow sufficient planning
and braking margins. Increasing the perception ranges also allows to extend
autonomy from light two-ton passenger vehicles to large-scale forty-ton trucks,
which need a longer planning horizon due to their high inertia. However, most
existing perception approaches focus on shorter ranges and rely on Bird's Eye
View (BEV) representations, which incur quadratic increases in memory and
compute costs as distance grows. To overcome this limitation, we built on top
of a sparse representation and introduced an efficient 3D encoding of
multi-modal and temporal features, along with a novel self-supervised
pre-training scheme that enables large-scale learning from unlabeled
camera-LiDAR data. Our approach extends perception distances to 250 meters and
achieves an 26.6% improvement in mAP in object detection and a decrease of
30.5% in Chamfer Distance in LiDAR forecasting compared to existing methods,
reaching distances up to 250 meters. Project Page:

### [78] [Online 3D Gaussian Splatting Modeling with Novel View Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14014)
*Byeonggwon Lee,Junkyu Park,Khang Truong Giang,Soohwan Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An online adaptive view-selection method improves 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) from RGB frames by selectively training on non-keyframes based on online reconstruction quality and pairing them with keyframes, aided by an online multi-view stereo framework to ensure 3D consistency; yields superior completeness and SOTA performance in outdoor scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Keyframe-only dense SLAM approaches often yield incomplete 3D reconstructions and struggle to generalize across diverse viewpoints under online processing constraints. There is a need to use additional frames from varied viewpoints, selected adaptively, to improve scene coverage without excessive computation.

Method: Online assessment of reconstruction quality to pick optimal non-keyframes for training; integrate selected non-keyframes with keyframes to refine incomplete regions from diverse viewpoints; adopt an online multi-view stereo (MVS) framework to maintain 3D consistency throughout 3DGS modeling.

Result: The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance, with notable improvements in completing complex outdoor scenes and overall reconstruction quality.

Conclusion: Adaptive view selection and an online MVS framework markedly improve the completeness, consistency, and generalization of online RGB-only 3DGS modeling, especially in challenging outdoor environments.

Abstract: This study addresses the challenge of generating online 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) models from RGB-only frames. Previous studies have employed dense SLAM
techniques to estimate 3D scenes from keyframes for 3DGS model construction.
However, these methods are limited by their reliance solely on keyframes, which
are insufficient to capture an entire scene, resulting in incomplete
reconstructions. Moreover, building a generalizable model requires
incorporating frames from diverse viewpoints to achieve broader scene coverage.
However, online processing restricts the use of many frames or extensive
training iterations. Therefore, we propose a novel method for high-quality 3DGS
modeling that improves model completeness through adaptive view selection. By
analyzing reconstruction quality online, our approach selects optimal
non-keyframes for additional training. By integrating both keyframes and
selected non-keyframes, the method refines incomplete regions from diverse
viewpoints, significantly enhancing completeness. We also present a framework
that incorporates an online multi-view stereo approach, ensuring consistency in
3D information throughout the 3DGS modeling process. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, delivering
exceptional performance in complex outdoor scenes.

*Tuo Chen,Jie Gui,Minjing Dong,Ju Jia,Lanting Fang,Jian Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Noisy Alignment (NA) is a simple DPCL defense that suppresses noise in poisoned images by optimizing the contrastive learning cropping layout, yielding state-of-the-art backdoor resistance while preserving clean-data accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data-poisoning backdoor attacks compromise self-supervised contrastive learning. Existing DPCLs rely on fragile co-occurrence cues and poorly suppress backdoor signals, leading to limited effectiveness. A manipulation that explicitly suppresses noise in poisoned data is needed.

Method: Identify the core objective of noisy alignment from training-controllable CL attacks and adapt it to data-poisoning. Implement NA by strategically tuning the contrastive learning random cropping mechanism, formulating it as an image layout optimization problem with theoretically derived optimal cropping parameters.

Result: NA achieves state-of-the-art performance among DPCLs while maintaining clean-data accuracy and shows robustness against common backdoor defenses.

Conclusion: NA provides a simple yet effective defense against DPCLs by suppressing background noise in poisoned images through optimized data augmentation, offering practical resilience for CL pretraining.

Abstract: Self-supervised contrastive learning (CL) effectively learns transferable
representations from unlabeled data containing images or image-text pairs but
suffers vulnerability to data poisoning backdoor attacks (DPCLs). An adversary
can inject poisoned images into pretraining datasets, causing compromised CL
encoders to exhibit targeted misbehavior in downstream tasks. Existing DPCLs,
however, achieve limited efficacy due to their dependence on fragile implicit
co-occurrence between backdoor and target object and inadequate suppression of
discriminative features in backdoored images. We propose Noisy Alignment (NA),
a DPCL method that explicitly suppresses noise components in poisoned images.
Inspired by powerful training-controllable CL attacks, we identify and extract
the critical objective of noisy alignment, adapting it effectively into
data-poisoning scenarios. Our method implements noisy alignment by
strategically manipulating contrastive learning's random cropping mechanism,
formulating this process as an image layout optimization problem with
theoretically derived optimal parameters. The resulting method is simple yet
effective, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to existing DPCLs,
while maintaining clean-data accuracy. Furthermore, Noisy Alignment
demonstrates robustness against common backdoor defenses. Codes can be found at

TL;DR: A sparse-frame video dubbing framework, InfiniteTalk, enables holistic, audio-driven full-body editing by preserving reference keyframes to maintain identity, gestures, and camera motion, addressing adaptive conditioning gaps in naive image-to-video models. It achieves state-of-the-art results on HDTF, CelebV-HQ, and EMTD with improved realism, emotional coherence, and motion synchronization for long sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional video dubbing edits only the mouth region, causing discordant facial expressions and body gestures and breaking viewer immersion. There is a need for identity preservation, iconic gestures, and camera trajectories in long, audio-driven editing. Naive image-to-video models struggle with adaptive conditioning, hindering long-sequence, holistic dubbing.

Method: Introduce sparse-frame video dubbing to preserve reference keyframes for identity, gestures, and camera motion while allowing holistic, audio-synchronized full-body motion editing. Analyze why naive image-to-video models fail due to lack of adaptive conditioning. Propose InfiniteTalk, a streaming audio-driven generator for infinite-length dubbing. The architecture leverages temporal context frames for seamless inter-chunk transitions and employs a simple sampling strategy that refines control strength by finely positioning reference frames.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations on HDTF, CelebV-HQ, and EMTD demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with quantitative metrics indicating superior visual realism, emotional coherence, and full-body motion synchronization.

Conclusion: The work advances audio-driven long-sequence dubbing by enabling adaptive conditioning and holistic, full-body editing through sparse-frame references and the InfiniteTalk architecture, validated across multiple datasets. It shows strong realism and coherence with potential for practical deployment and further improvements in efficiency and generalization.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in video AIGC have ushered in a transformative era for
audio-driven human animation. However, conventional video dubbing techniques
remain constrained to mouth region editing, resulting in discordant facial
expressions and body gestures that compromise viewer immersion. To overcome
this limitation, we introduce sparse-frame video dubbing, a novel paradigm that
strategically preserves reference keyframes to maintain identity, iconic
gestures, and camera trajectories while enabling holistic, audio-synchronized
full-body motion editing. Through critical analysis, we identify why naive
image-to-video models fail in this task, particularly their inability to
achieve adaptive conditioning. Addressing this, we propose InfiniteTalk, a
streaming audio-driven generator designed for infinite-length long sequence
dubbing. This architecture leverages temporal context frames for seamless
inter-chunk transitions and incorporates a simple yet effective sampling
strategy that optimizes control strength via fine-grained reference frame
positioning. Comprehensive evaluations on HDTF, CelebV-HQ, and EMTD datasets
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Quantitative metrics confirm superior
visual realism, emotional coherence, and full-body motion synchronization.

Motivation: Modern fast 3D generators produce coarse shapes due to computational constraints; there is a need for a lightweight, flexible refinement method that can add geometric detail without retraining large 3D models.

Method: Model coarse-to-fine refinement via data-dependent flows in latent space; introduce a token matching strategy to ensure precise spatial correspondence during refinement; train on data designed to match characteristics of synthesized coarse shapes; applicable to outputs from various 3D generation/reconstruction pipelines.

Result: Extensive experiments show that DetailGen3D achieves high-fidelity geometric detail synthesis while maintaining efficient training, compatible with single-view and sparse multi-view inputs across different base methods.

Conclusion: DetailGen3D provides an efficient, general post-processing refinement approach that augments existing 3D generators with detailed geometry while preserving global structure.

Abstract: Modern 3D generation methods can rapidly create shapes from sparse or single
views, but their outputs often lack geometric detail due to computational
constraints. We present DetailGen3D, a generative approach specifically
designed to enhance these generated 3D shapes. Our key insight is to model the
coarse-to-fine transformation directly through data-dependent flows in latent
space, avoiding the computational overhead of large-scale 3D generative models.
We introduce a token matching strategy that ensures accurate spatial
correspondence during refinement, enabling local detail synthesis while
preserving global structure. By carefully designing our training data to match
the characteristics of synthesized coarse shapes, our method can effectively
enhance shapes produced by various 3D generation and reconstruction approaches,
from single-view to sparse multi-view inputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS achieves high-fidelity novel view synthesis but requires many 3D Gaussians, leading to high memory/storage demands; a more compact model is desirable.

Method: Propose Distilled-3DGS with teachers including vanilla 3DGS, noise-augmented variants, and dropout-regularized versions. Aggregate teacher outputs to supervise the student. Introduce a structural similarity loss to align the spatial geometric distributions between student and teacher models.

Result: Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on diverse datasets show that Distilled-3DGS delivers competitive rendering quality with improved storage efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods; project page and code are provided.

Conclusion: Knowledge distillation provides a simple yet effective framework to compress 3DGS without sacrificing rendering performance, achieving a good balance between quality and storage.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has exhibited remarkable efficacy in novel view
synthesis (NVS). However, it suffers from a significant drawback: achieving
high-fidelity rendering typically necessitates a large number of 3D Gaussians,
resulting in substantial memory consumption and storage requirements. To
address this challenge, we propose the first knowledge distillation framework
for 3DGS, featuring various teacher models, including vanilla 3DGS,
noise-augmented variants, and dropout-regularized versions. The outputs of
these teachers are aggregated to guide the optimization of a lightweight
student model. To distill the hidden geometric structure, we propose a
structural similarity loss to boost the consistency of spatial geometric
distributions between the student and teacher model. Through comprehensive
quantitative and qualitative evaluations across diverse datasets, the proposed
Distilled-3DGS, a simple yet effective framework without bells and whistles,
achieves promising rendering results in both rendering quality and storage
efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods. Project page:

Motivation: Standard retrieval models struggle with fine-grained compositional queries and temporal understanding; need dense modification descriptions to better align query with target video.

Method: Introduce Dense-WebVid-CoVR dataset with dense modification text; develop a cross-attention fusion model that aligns dense textual modifications with target videos via a grounded text encoder.

Result: State-of-the-art performance across metrics, notably Recall@1 71.3% in visual+text setting, surpassing previous methods by 3.4%.

Conclusion: Providing the dataset, code, and model enables detailed compositional video retrieval and demonstrates effectiveness of cross-attention with grounded text encoding for dense modification queries.

Abstract: Composed video retrieval is a challenging task that strives to retrieve a
target video based on a query video and a textual description detailing
specific modifications. Standard retrieval frameworks typically struggle to
handle the complexity of fine-grained compositional queries and variations in
temporal understanding limiting their retrieval ability in the fine-grained
setting. To address this issue, we introduce a novel dataset that captures both
fine-grained and composed actions across diverse video segments, enabling more
detailed compositional changes in retrieved video content. The proposed
dataset, named Dense-WebVid-CoVR, consists of 1.6 million samples with dense
modification text that is around seven times more than its existing
counterpart. We further develop a new model that integrates visual and textual
information through Cross-Attention (CA) fusion using grounded text encoder,
enabling precise alignment between dense query modifications and target videos.
The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results surpassing existing
methods on all metrics. Notably, it achieves 71.3\% Recall@1 in visual+text
setting and outperforms the state-of-the-art by 3.4\%, highlighting its

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate visual question answering on plots and whether VisualBERT’s cross-modality fusion is necessary to align plot elements with question phrases.

Method: Proposed a VisualBERT-based architecture (BERT-VQA) with a pretrained ResNet-101 image encoder (with optional joint fusion) and a baseline of an LSTM+CNN+shallow classifier; trained and evaluated on plot-based VQA tasks.

Result: The final outcome disproved the core hypothesis that the cross-modality module is essential for aligning plot components with question phrases; cross-modality fusion may not be necessary for this task, offering insights into the difficulty of plot VQA and architecture suitability.

Conclusion: Plot-based VQA is challenging; the study provides guidance on architecture choices for this domain and suggests that simpler or alternative architectures may compete with more complex cross-modal modules for plots.

Abstract: Visual question answering has been an exciting challenge in the field of
natural language understanding, as it requires deep learning models to exchange
information from both vision and language domains. In this project, we aim to
tackle a subtask of this problem, namely visual question answering on plots. To
achieve this, we developed BERT-VQA, a VisualBERT-based model architecture with
a pretrained ResNet 101 image encoder, along with a potential addition of joint
fusion. We trained and evaluated this model against a baseline that consisted
of a LSTM, a CNN, and a shallow classifier. The final outcome disproved our
core hypothesis that the cross-modality module in VisualBERT is essential in
aligning plot components with question phrases. Therefore, our work provided
valuable insights into the difficulty of the plot question answering challenge
as well as the appropriateness of different model architectures in solving this
problem.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A multimodal sentiment analysis framework for crisis-related social media that fuses CNN-based image analysis with LLM-driven text processing using contextual attention to improve classification of informative versus noninformative posts across natural disasters, achieving modest yet meaningful gains over baselines and enabling real-time crisis management insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Public sentiment during natural disasters is crucial for crisis response, yet most systems treat text and images separately. Integrating visual and textual signals with advanced language understanding (LLMs) can better capture sentiment and informativeness, guiding emergency interventions.

Method: A unified neural architecture that combines CNN-based image analysis with LLM-based text processing (via GPT prompts) on the CrisisMMD dataset. It includes a contextual attention fusion mechanism to model intermodal interactions, enabling the model to learn fused features and improve sentiment/informative classification.

Result: The approach yields improvements over baselines, with a 2.43% increase in accuracy and a 5.18% increase in F1-score for classifying posts as informative vs noninformative across various disasters, indicating better handling of multimodal crisis data.

Conclusion: Contextual-attention–driven fusion of multimodal signals and LLM-powered text understanding offers a promising direction for AI-driven crisis management, enabling more accurate real-time sentiment awareness and situational insight during disasters.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach for multimodal sentiment analysis on
social media, particularly in the context of natural disasters, where
understanding public sentiment is crucial for effective crisis management.
Unlike conventional methods that process text and image modalities separately,
our approach seamlessly integrates Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based
image analysis with Large Language Model (LLM) based text processing,
leveraging Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) and prompt engineering to
extract sentiment relevant features from the CrisisMMD dataset. To effectively
model intermodal relationships, we introduce a contextual attention mechanism
within the fusion process. Leveraging contextual-attention layers, this
mechanism effectively captures intermodality interactions, enhancing the
model's comprehension of complex relationships between textual and visual data.
The deep neural network architecture of our model learns from these fused
features, leading to improved accuracy compared to existing baselines.
Experimental results demonstrate significant advancements in classifying social
media data into informative and noninformative categories across various
natural disasters. Our model achieves a notable 2.43% increase in accuracy and
5.18% in F1-score, highlighting its efficacy in processing complex multimodal
data. Beyond quantitative metrics, our approach provides deeper insight into
the sentiments expressed during crises. The practical implications extend to
real time disaster management, where enhanced sentiment analysis can optimize
the accuracy of emergency interventions. By bridging the gap between multimodal
analysis, LLM powered text understanding, and disaster response, our work
presents a promising direction for Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven crisis

### [87] [Strategies for training point distributions in physics-informed neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13216)
*Santosh Humagain,Toni Schneidereit*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Training point distribution in physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) drives accuracy; a systematic study across 2 ODEs and 2 PDEs using 5 data-generation strategies and shallow networks reveals that the sampling regime interacts with equation type and initialization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand how sampling of training points affects PINN performance and reproducibility, addressing a key design choice in numerically solving differential equations with neural nets.

Method: Empirical evaluation of 5 training-data generation strategies on 2 ODEs and 2 PDEs; shallow networks with 1–2 hidden layers; included sine-based points inspired by Chebyshev nodes; tested under varying initializations (random and fixed seeds); mesh-free computations on arbitrary grids.

Result: Training point distribution materially affects solution accuracy; the effect varies with equation characteristics; some distributions align better with certain equations; reproducibility can be challenged by initialization choices.

Conclusion: Careful selection of sampling strategy is essential in PINNs and should consider the underlying differential equation; sine/Chebyshev-inspired sampling shows promise; further research needed to map sampling choices to equation types and to improve reproducibility.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks approach the approximation of differential
equations by directly incorporating their structure and given conditions in a
loss function. This enables conditions like, e.g., invariants to be easily
added during the modelling phase. In addition, the approach can be considered
as mesh free and can be utilised to compute solutions on arbitrary grids after
the training phase. Therefore, physics-informed neural networks are emerging as
a promising alternative to solving differential equations with methods from
numerical mathematics. However, their performance highly depends on a large
variety of factors. In this paper, we systematically investigate and evaluate a
core component of the approach, namely the training point distribution. We test
two ordinary and two partial differential equations with five strategies for
training data generation and shallow network architectures, with one and two
hidden layers. In addition to common distributions, we introduce sine-based
training points, which are motivated by the construction of Chebyshev nodes.
The results are challenged by using certain parameter combinations like, e.g.,
random and fixed-seed weight initialisation for reproducibility. The results
show the impact of the training point distributions on the solution accuracy
and we find evidence that they are connected to the characteristics of the
differential equation.

### [88] [Deep Graph Neural Point Process For Learning Temporal Interactive Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13219)
*Su Chen,Xiaohua Qi,Xixun Lin,Yanmin Shang,Xiaolin Xu,Yangxi Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces DGNPP, a Deep Graph Neural Point Process for temporal interaction networks that combines static topology-aware embeddings with dynamic temporal updates to improve event and time prediction, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation that prior TIN models overlook the influence of network topology on temporal interactions, causing coarse-grained predictions.

Method: Two-layer architecture: Node Aggregation Layer learns static user/item representations from graph topology; Self Attentive Layer updates embeddings over time; combines dynamic and static embeddings in the event intensity function; trained via maximum likelihood estimation.

Result: Empirical results on three public datasets show state‑of‑the‑art performance for both event prediction and time prediction, with high efficiency and significant improvements over baselines.

Conclusion: Integrating topology-aware static embeddings with dynamic temporal representations in a graph-based point process yields superior, efficient TIN modeling and predictive accuracy.

Abstract: Learning temporal interaction networks(TIN) is previously regarded as a
coarse-grained multi-sequence prediction problem, ignoring the network topology
structure influence. This paper addresses this limitation and a Deep Graph
Neural Point Process(DGNPP) model for TIN is proposed. DGNPP consists of two
key modules: the Node Aggregation Layer and the Self Attentive Layer. The Node
Aggregation Layer captures topological structures to generate static
representation for users and items, while the Self Attentive Layer dynamically
updates embeddings over time. By incorporating both dynamic and static
embeddings into the event intensity function and optimizing the model via
maximum likelihood estimation, DGNPP predicts events and occurrence time
effectively. Experimental evaluations on three public datasets demonstrate that
DGNPP achieves superior performance in event prediction and time prediction
tasks with high efficiency, significantly outperforming baseline models and
effectively mitigating the limitations of prior approaches.

### [89] [A Recurrent Neural Network based Clustering Method for Binary Data Sets in Education](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13224)
*Mizuki Ohira,Toshimichi Saito*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An RNN-based clustering method for large binary S-P educational charts; uses network dynamics with multiple fixed points where basins of attraction define clusters, evaluated using average caution index; experiments confirm effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To manage and cluster growing binary education datasets (S-P charts) whose size becomes unwieldy as the number of students increases.

Method: Apply a recurrent neural network that exhibits multiple fixed points; clustering is achieved through basins of attraction corresponding to small S-P charts; evaluate with average caution index as a feature of answer-pattern singularity.

Result: Fundamental experiments show the proposed clustering method is effective.

Conclusion: RNN-based clustering provides a viable approach to partition large S-P charts into smaller charts via network dynamics and basins of attraction; average caution index aids evaluation of pattern singularity.

Abstract: This paper studies an application of a recurrent neural network to clustering
method for the S-P chart: a binary data set used widely in education. As the
number of students increases, the S-P chart becomes hard to handle. In order to
classify the large chart into smaller charts, we present a simple clustering
method based on the network dynamics. In the method, the network has multiple
fixed points and basins of attraction give clusters corresponding to small S-P
charts. In order to evaluate the clustering performance, we present an
important feature quantity: average caution index that characterizes
singularity of students answer oatterns. Performing fundamental experiments,
effectiveness of the method is confirmed.

### [90] [RISE: Enhancing VLM Image Annotation with Self-Supervised Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13229)
*Suhang Hu,Wei Hu,Yuhang Su,Fan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RISE is a two-stage self-supervised framework that generates and leverages high-quality, visually grounded chains of thought to improve reasoning and annotation accuracy in vision-language models, without manual CoT annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VL models struggle with tasks requiring complex reasoning; SFT ignores rationales; Visual-RFT yields inconsistent CoTs due to lack of verified CoTs in pretraining; a self-supervised path to generate and refine CoTs is needed.

Method: Stage 1 Reason: RISE-CoT uses reinforcement learning to create an annotation-reasoning-annotation loop that yields visually grounded, logically consistent CoTs and validates their ability to reconstruct annotations without leaking the answers. Stage 2 Inspire/Strengthen: filter high-quality CoTs via RISE-CoT rewards, perform supervised fine-tuning (RISE-R1) on that subset, then reinforcement fine-tuning to align reasoning with accurate annotations.

Result: RISE-trained Qwen2-VL-2B outperforms SFT and Visual-RFT on both complex and simple image annotation tasks, with robust performance and enhanced explainability.

Conclusion: RISE provides a self-supervised path to advance VLM reasoning and annotation quality without manual CoT annotations.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with complex image annotation tasks,
such as emotion classification and context-driven object detection, which
demand sophisticated reasoning. Standard Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) focuses
solely on annotation outcomes, ignoring underlying rationales, while Visual
Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (Visual-RFT) produces inconsistent Chains of Thought
(CoTs) due to the absence of high-quality, verified CoTs during pre-training.
We introduce RISE (Reason-Inspire-Strengthen-Expertise), a two-stage framework
to overcome these limitations. In the Reason stage (RISE-CoT), a reinforcement
learning-driven "annotation-reasoning-annotation" closed-loop generates
visually grounded, logically consistent CoTs by verifying their ability to
reconstruct original annotations without direct leakage. The Inspire and
Strengthen stage (RISE-R1) leverages a high-quality CoT subset, filtered by
RISE-CoT rewards, for supervised fine-tuning, followed by reinforcement
fine-tuning to produce interpretable reasoning and accurate annotations,
achieving Expertise in complex visual tasks. Evaluated on complex and simple
image annotation tasks, RISE-trained Qwen2-VL-2B outperforms SFT and
Visual-RFT, achieving robust performance and enhanced explainability. RISE
offers a self-supervised solution for advancing VLM reasoning without requiring
manually annotated CoTs.

### [91] [Data driven feedback linearization of nonlinear control systems via Lie derivatives and stacked regression approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13241)
*Lakshmi Priya P. K.,Andreas Schwung*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework that uses sparse regression to identify a system and Lie-derivative based augmented constraints to design a feedback controller, achieving input-output linearization while suppressing internal dynamics.



<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discovering governing equations and designing effective feedback controllers is challenging due to nonlinear dynamics and unknown internal states. The work aims to exploit prior dynamic behavior and enforce constraints that eliminate hidden dynamics.

Method: 1) Identify the system with a sparse regression algorithm. 2) Use Lie derivatives on a dictionary of output functions to derive an augmented constraint that ensures no internal dynamics are observed. 3) Combine stacked regression with relative degree conditions to learn and feedback-linearize the true governing equations.

Result: The abstract presents a methodological framework rather than empirical results; it outlines the approach and novelty but does not report experiments or data.

Conclusion: Proposes a novel integration of stacked regression and relative degree conditions with sparse identification and Lie-derivative based control to discover and feedback-linearize the true governing equations of a physical model.

Abstract: Discovering the governing equations of a physical system and designing an
effective feedback controller remains one of the most challenging and intensive
areas of ongoing research. This task demands a deep understanding of the system
behavior, including the nonlinear factors that influence its dynamics. In this
article, we propose a novel methodology for identifying a feedback linearized
physical system based on known prior dynamic behavior. Initially, the system is
identified using a sparse regression algorithm, subsequently a feedback
controller is designed for the discovered system by applying Lie derivatives to
the dictionary of output functions to derive an augmented constraint which
guarantees that no internal dynamics are observed. Unlike the prior related
works, the novel aspect of this article combines the approach of stacked
regression algorithm and relative degree conditions to discover and feedback
linearize the true governing equations of a physical model.

### [92] [Physically Plausible Data Augmentations for Wearable IMU-based Human Activity Recognition Using Physics Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13284)
*Nobuyuki Oishi,Philip Birch,Daniel Roggen,Paula Lago*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduce Physically Plausible Data Augmentation (PPDA) for sensor-based HAR using physics simulation to model realistic variabilities (movement, sensor placement, hardware effects). PPDA outperforms traditional STDAs, enabling fewer subjects for training with consistent gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HAR suffers from scarce labeled data and the risk that traditional data augmentations (STDA) create implausible data that alters activity semantics. A physically plausible augmentation approach could preserve label meaning and improve generalization across real-world scenarios.

Method: Use motion capture or video-based pose estimates as input; apply physics simulation to generate realistic variations in body movements, sensor placements, and hardware-related effects. Systematically compare PPDA against STDA on three public datasets, evaluating augmentations individually and in combination while varying the number of training subjects.

Result: PPDA yields macro F1 gains (average ~3.7 percentage points; up to 13 pp) over STDAs and achieves performance comparable to using up to 60% fewer training subjects than STDAs.

Conclusion: This is the first systematic study of PPDA in sensor-based HAR. Incorporating physical plausibility via physics simulation enhances data augmentation, offering a cost-effective, scalable way to generate synthetic IMU data and mitigate annotation scarcity in HAR.

Abstract: The scarcity of high-quality labeled data in sensor-based Human Activity
Recognition (HAR) hinders model performance and limits generalization across
real-world scenarios. Data augmentation is a key strategy to mitigate this
issue by enhancing the diversity of training datasets. Signal
Transformation-based Data Augmentation (STDA) techniques have been widely used
in HAR. However, these methods are often physically implausible, potentially
resulting in augmented data that fails to preserve the original meaning of the
activity labels. In this study, we introduce and systematically characterize
Physically Plausible Data Augmentation (PPDA) enabled by physics simulation.
PPDA leverages human body movement data from motion capture or video-based pose
estimation and incorporates various realistic variabilities through physics
simulation, including modifying body movements, sensor placements, and
hardware-related effects. We compare the performance of PPDAs with traditional
STDAs on three public datasets of daily activities and fitness workouts. First,
we evaluate each augmentation method individually, directly comparing PPDAs to
their STDA counterparts. Next, we assess how combining multiple PPDAs can
reduce the need for initial data collection by varying the number of subjects
used for training. Experiments show consistent benefits of PPDAs, improving
macro F1 scores by an average of 3.7 pp (up to 13 pp) and achieving competitive
performance with up to 60% fewer training subjects than STDAs. As the first
systematic study of PPDA in sensor-based HAR, these results highlight the
advantages of pursuing physical plausibility in data augmentation and the
potential of physics simulation for generating synthetic Inertial Measurement
Unit data for training deep learning HAR models. This cost-effective and
scalable approach therefore helps address the annotation scarcity challenge in
HAR.

### [93] [Towards Human-AI Complementarity in Matching Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13285)
*Adrian Arnaiz-Rodriguez,Nina Corvelo Benz,Suhas Thejaswi,Nuria Oliver,Manuel Gomez-Rodriguez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A data-driven collaborative matching system (comatch) defers uncertain decisions to humans to maximize performance, achieving better outcomes than either humans or algorithms alone in high-stakes matching tasks; validated with a large 800-participant study and open-sourced.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve human-AI complementarity in high-stakes matching tasks. Existing systems don't reliably improve human decisions when combined with algorithms, so there is a need for systems that intelligently delegate decisions to humans to maximize overall performance.

Method: Introduce comatch, a data-driven system that only makes decisions it is confident about and defers others to human decision makers. It optimizes the trade-off between automated and deferred decisions to maximize performance. Validation via a large-scale human-subject study with 800 participants and an open-source implementation.

Result: Comatch-produced matching outcomes outperform those generated by either human participants alone or algorithmic matching alone.

Conclusion: Collaborative, confidence-based deferral enables human-AI complementarity in matching tasks, suggesting practical benefits and a path for future research and deployment in high-stakes domains.

Abstract: Data-driven algorithmic matching systems promise to help human decision
makers make better matching decisions in a wide variety of high-stakes
application domains, such as healthcare and social service provision. However,
existing systems are not designed to achieve human-AI complementarity:
decisions made by a human using an algorithmic matching system are not
necessarily better than those made by the human or by the algorithm alone. Our
work aims to address this gap. To this end, we propose collaborative matching
(comatch), a data-driven algorithmic matching system that takes a collaborative
approach: rather than making all the matching decisions for a matching task
like existing systems, it selects only the decisions that it is the most
confident in, deferring the rest to the human decision maker. In the process,
comatch optimizes how many decisions it makes and how many it defers to the
human decision maker to provably maximize performance. We conduct a large-scale
human subject study with $800$ participants to validate the proposed approach.
The results demonstrate that the matching outcomes produced by comatch
outperform those generated by either human participants or by algorithmic
matching on their own. The data gathered in our human subject study and an
implementation of our system are available as open source at
https://github.com/Networks-Learning/human-AI-complementarity-matching.

### [94] [Hierarchical Conformal Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13288)
*Floris den Hengst,Inès Blin,Majid Mohammadi,Syed Ihtesham Hussain Shah,Taraneh Younesian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hierarchical conformal classification (HCC) extends conformal prediction to incorporate class hierarchies, yielding multi-level, hierarchy-aware prediction sets with guaranteed coverage; it reduces the candidate search space and improves interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CP is flat and ignores semantic/hierarchical relationships among classes. Incorporating hierarchies can improve prediction interpretability, align with domain knowledge, and potentially enhance practical usefulness while preserving finite-sample coverage guarantees.

Method: HCC is formulated as a constrained optimization problem that produces prediction sets consisting of nodes at different hierarchy levels. The authors prove that a smaller, well-structured subset of candidate solutions suffices to preserve coverage and optimality, addressing the combinatorial nature of hierarchical sets.

Result: Empirical evaluation on three new benchmarks (audio, image, text) demonstrates advantages of hierarchical sets. A user study shows annotators prefer hierarchical over flat prediction sets.

Conclusion: HCC provides coverage guarantees while leveraging hierarchical structure, improving interpretability and user preference. The approach is applicable across modalities and could influence downstream decision-making by aligning with domain hierarchies.

Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) is a powerful framework for quantifying uncertainty
in machine learning models, offering reliable predictions with finite-sample
coverage guarantees. When applied to classification, CP produces a prediction
set of possible labels that is guaranteed to contain the true label with high
probability, regardless of the underlying classifier. However, standard CP
treats classes as flat and unstructured, ignoring domain knowledge such as
semantic relationships or hierarchical structure among class labels. This paper
presents hierarchical conformal classification (HCC), an extension of CP that
incorporates class hierarchies into both the structure and semantics of
prediction sets. We formulate HCC as a constrained optimization problem whose
solutions yield prediction sets composed of nodes at different levels of the
hierarchy, while maintaining coverage guarantees. To address the combinatorial
nature of the problem, we formally show that a much smaller, well-structured
subset of candidate solutions suffices to ensure coverage while upholding
optimality. An empirical evaluation on three new benchmarks consisting of
audio, image, and text data highlights the advantages of our approach, and a
user study shows that annotators significantly prefer hierarchical over flat
prediction sets.

### [95] [Efficient Constraint-Aware Flow Matching via Randomized Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13316)
*Zhengyan Huan,Jacob Boerma,Li-Ping Liu,Shuchin Aeron*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Extends Flow Matching to constrained sampling under two settings: (a) differentiable distance to constraints, using a penalty in FM; (b) constraint sets via membership queries, using randomized mean flow and a two-stage approach for efficiency. Demonstrates improved constraint satisfaction while preserving target distribution; includes an adversarial example generation use-case; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Constrained sampling is difficult with standard FM methods, especially when constraints are not simple convex sets or when only oracle access to the constraint is available. The work aims to handle general constraints and improve constraint satisfaction without sacrificing distributional fidelity, while also reducing computational cost.

Method: Case (a): augment FM objective with a term penalizing the distance between sampled points and the constraint set. Case (b): introduce randomization and learn a mean flow that is likely to satisfy constraints; propose a two-stage approach where both stages approximate the original flow, but only the second stage probes constraints via randomization. Shows applicability to oracle-based constraints (e.g., adversarial example generation using hard-label black-box classifier queries).

Result: Numerical experiments on synthetic constrained generation show significant gains in constraint satisfaction while preserving target distributions. The two-stage approach is computationally efficient and effective in leveraging oracle-based constraints; code is released.

Conclusion: The proposed FM extensions offer practical methods for constrained sampling beyond convex or barrier-based constraints, with potential for broader applications (e.g., adversarial example generation) and directions for further research.

Abstract: We consider the problem of generating samples via Flow Matching (FM) with an
additional requirement that the generated samples must satisfy given
constraints. We consider two scenarios, viz.: (a) when a differentiable
distance function to the constraint set is given, and (b) when the constraint
set is only available via queries to a membership oracle. For case (a), we
propose a simple adaptation of the FM objective with an additional term that
penalizes the distance between the constraint set and the generated samples.
For case (b), we propose to employ randomization and learn a mean flow that is
numerically shown to have a high likelihood of satisfying the constraints. This
approach deviates significantly from existing works that require simple convex
constraints, knowledge of a barrier function, or a reflection mechanism to
constrain the probability flow. Furthermore, in the proposed setting we show
that a two-stage approach, where both stages approximate the same original flow
but with only the second stage probing the constraints via randomization, is
more computationally efficient. Through several synthetic cases of constrained
generation, we numerically show that the proposed approaches achieve
significant gains in terms of constraint satisfaction while matching the target
distributions. As a showcase for a practical oracle-based constraint, we show
how our approach can be used for training an adversarial example generator,
using queries to a hard-label black-box classifier. We conclude with several
future research directions. Our code is available at
https://github.com/ZhengyanHuan/FM-RE.

### [96] [Decoding Communications with Partial Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13326)
*Dylan Cope,Peter McBurney*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Examines language learning under partial observability, proposing a learning-based decoder to infer hidden environmental info from actions and messages; demonstrated in toy settings and formalized.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Imitation-learning models assume full observability; relaxing this reveals new challenges and requires methods to infer private information for successful language acquisition.

Method: Toy demonstrations of the problem, formal analysis of challenges in partial observability, and a learning-based algorithm that decodes private information to facilitate language acquisition.

Result: Demonstrates feasibility in toy settings; formally characterizes challenges; presents a learning-based decoder that infers hidden information to support language learning, with discussion of limitations.

Conclusion: Partial observability is a significant but addressable hurdle for language acquisition models; the proposed decoding approach offers a path forward, with future work needed to generalize to more realistic scenarios.

Abstract: Machine language acquisition is often presented as a problem of imitation
learning: there exists a community of language users from which a learner
observes speech acts and attempts to decode the mappings between utterances and
situations. However, an interesting consideration that is typically unaddressed
is partial observability, i.e. the learner is assumed to see all relevant
information. This paper explores relaxing this assumption, thereby posing a
more challenging setting where such information needs to be inferred from
knowledge of the environment, the actions taken, and messages sent. We see
several motivating examples of this problem, demonstrate how they can be solved
in a toy setting, and formally explore challenges that arise in more general
settings. A learning-based algorithm is then presented to perform the decoding
of private information to facilitate language acquisition.

### [97] [A Dual-Attention Graph Network for fMRI Data Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13328)
*Amirali Arbab,Zeinab Davarani,Mehran Safayani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A dynamic graph-based fMRI classification method using transformer-driven dynamic connectivity and GCN-transformer fusion for ASD diagnosis, achieving 63.2% accuracy and 60.0 AUC on ABIDE subset, outperforming static methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fMRI classification often uses static connectivity and fails to capture spatiotemporal dynamics; there is a need to jointly model time-varying interactions and temporal context to improve ASD diagnosis.

Method: Dynamically infer functional connectivity per time interval via transformer-based attention to create time-varying graphs; process graphs with GCNs and transformers; fuse hierarchical spatiotemporal features via GCN-transformer fusion.

Result: 63.2% accuracy and 60.0 AUC on ABIDE subset; outperforms static graph-based approaches (e.g., GCN 51.8%).

Conclusion: Attention-driven dynamic graph creation and hierarchical spatiotemporal fusion enable effective joint modeling of dynamic connectivity and spatiotemporal context for fMRI classification; demonstrates the value of dynamic graphs in ASD diagnosis.

Abstract: Understanding the complex neural activity dynamics is crucial for the
development of the field of neuroscience. Although current functional MRI
classification approaches tend to be based on static functional connectivity or
cannot capture spatio-temporal relationships comprehensively, we present a new
framework that leverages dynamic graph creation and spatiotemporal attention
mechanisms for Autism Spectrum Disorder(ASD) diagnosis. The approach used in
this research dynamically infers functional brain connectivity in each time
interval using transformer-based attention mechanisms, enabling the model to
selectively focus on crucial brain regions and time segments. By constructing
time-varying graphs that are then processed with Graph Convolutional Networks
(GCNs) and transformers, our method successfully captures both localized
interactions and global temporal dependencies. Evaluated on the subset of ABIDE
dataset, our model achieves 63.2 accuracy and 60.0 AUC, outperforming static
graph-based approaches (e.g., GCN:51.8). This validates the efficacy of joint
modeling of dynamic connectivity and spatio-temporal context for fMRI
classification. The core novelty arises from (1) attention-driven dynamic graph
creation that learns temporal brain region interactions and (2) hierarchical
spatio-temporal feature fusion through GCNtransformer fusion.

TL;DR: X-MoE is a cross-platform MoE training system enabling large-scale training of expert-specialized MoEs (e.g., DeepSeek-MoE) on non-NVIDIA hardware, featuring padding-free training, redundancy-bypassing dispatch, and hybrid sequence-sharded MoE blocks. Demonstrated on AMD Frontier: up to 545B parameters across 1024 GPUs, 10x larger than previous under same budget, with high throughput; code at GitHub.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MoE systems suffer from activation memory overhead, costly all-to-all communication, and limited cross-platform efficiency, hindering scaling of next-gen MoEs; need scalable, cross-platform MoE training to unlock more computational potential.

Method: Padding-free MoE training with cross-platform kernels; redundancy-bypassing dispatch; hybrid parallelism with sequence-sharded MoE blocks.

Result: Scales DeepSeek-style MoEs up to 545B parameters across 1024 GPUs (Frontier, AMD MI250X); 10x larger than the largest trainable model under the same hardware budget; maintains high training throughput.

Conclusion: X-MoE enables scalable, cross-platform MoE training, expanding the practical size and potential of expert-specialized MoEs beyond NVIDIA-dominated systems; source code available.

Abstract: Emerging expert-specialized Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures, such as
DeepSeek-MoE, deliver strong model quality through fine-grained expert
segmentation and large top-k routing. However, their scalability is limited by
substantial activation memory overhead and costly all-to-all communication.
Furthermore, current MoE training systems - primarily optimized for NVIDIA GPUs
- perform suboptimally on non-NVIDIA platforms, leaving significant
computational potential untapped. In this work, we present X-MoE, a novel MoE
training system designed to deliver scalable training performance for
next-generation MoE architectures. X-MoE achieves this via several novel
techniques, including efficient padding-free MoE training with cross-platform
kernels, redundancy-bypassing dispatch, and hybrid parallelism with
sequence-sharded MoE blocks. Our evaluation on the Frontier supercomputer,
powered by AMD MI250X GPUs, shows that X-MoE scales DeepSeek-style MoEs up to
545 billion parameters across 1024 GPUs - 10x larger than the largest trainable
model with existing methods under the same hardware budget, while maintaining
high training throughput. The source code of X-MoE is available at

*Daniel Hsu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A concise linear-algebraic framework to prove dimension lower bounds for linear methods in L2 function approximation, extending Barron’s Kolmogorov-width style arguments to derive sample-size lower bounds for kernel methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand fundamental limits of linear learning algorithms for L2 approximation and to connect dimension constraints with sample complexity in kernel-based methods, via a simple, general argument.

Method: A linear-algebraic argument that relates the dimension of the hypothesis/feature space to approximation error in L2, echoing Barron (1993) for Kolmogorov n-widths; applied to derive lower bounds on the number of samples (or dimension) required by kernel methods to achieve a given accuracy.

Result: Derives dimension lower bounds for linear L2 approximation methods; yields lower bounds on sample size for kernel algorithms; shows the approach recovers known Barron-type results in a new setting.

Conclusion: The note provides a compact framework tying dimension, approximation error, and sample size for linear methods in L2 settings; useful for understanding intrinsic limits of kernel methods and linking to Kolmogorov n-widths.

Abstract: This short note presents a linear algebraic approach to proving dimension
lower bounds for linear methods that solve $L^2$ function approximation
problems. The basic argument has appeared in the literature before (e.g.,
Barron, 1993) for establishing lower bounds on Kolmogorov $n$-widths. The
argument is applied to give sample size lower bounds for kernel methods.

*Wenhao Mu,Zhi Cao,Mehmed Uludag,Alexander Rodríguez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A diffusion-based time-series framework (ODE-Diff) leverages high-level signals from imperfect expert models to guide generative modeling, bridging mechanistic and data-driven approaches to improve counterfactual distribution prediction in dynamical systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address data scarcity and reliance on point estimates by enabling reliable, distribution-aware causal inference in complex dynamical systems (e.g., public health and medicine).

Method: A time-series diffusion model (ODE-Diff) that incorporates guidance from imperfect expert models by extracting high-level signals to form structured priors for the generative process, thereby blending mechanistic insight with data-driven learning.

Result: Across semi-synthetic COVID-19 simulations, synthetic pharmacological dynamics, and real-world case studies, ODE-Diff consistently outperforms strong baselines in both point prediction and distributional accuracy.

Conclusion: The approach provides a reliable, interpretable framework for counterfactual forecasting that fuses mechanistic knowledge with diffusion-based generation, improving predictive performance under data scarcity.

Abstract: Predicting counterfactual distributions in complex dynamical systems is
essential for scientific modeling and decision-making in domains such as public
health and medicine. However, existing methods often rely on point estimates or
purely data-driven models, which tend to falter under data scarcity. We propose
a time series diffusion-based framework that incorporates guidance from
imperfect expert models by extracting high-level signals to serve as structured
priors for generative modeling. Our method, ODE-Diff, bridges mechanistic and
data-driven approaches, enabling more reliable and interpretable causal
inference. We evaluate ODE-Diff across semi-synthetic COVID-19 simulations,
synthetic pharmacological dynamics, and real-world case studies, demonstrating
that it consistently outperforms strong baselines in both point prediction and
distributional accuracy.

### [101] [Adaptive Conformal Prediction Intervals Over Trajectory Ensembles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13362)
*Ruipu Li,Daniel Menacho,Alexander Rodríguez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A conformal-prediction-based framework that converts sampled trajectories into calibrated, sharp prediction intervals with theoretical coverage guarantees, using online updates and an inter-step dependency optimization to handle temporal structures and allow discontinuities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Trajectory forecasting across domains (e.g., autonomous driving, weather, epidemics) often yields uncalibrated ensembles. There is a need for prediction intervals with coverage guarantees that adapt to temporal dependencies and discontinuities in trajectories to support informed decision making.

Method: A unified conformal prediction framework applied to sampled trajectories. Introduces an online update step and an optimization step to model inter-step dependencies, enabling discontinuous prediction intervals around each trajectory, capturing temporal structure and producing sharper, adaptive uncertainty estimates.

Result: The method provides theoretical coverage guarantees and yields sharper, more adaptive prediction intervals that capture temporal dependencies and allow discontinuities around trajectories.

Conclusion: A principled, general framework for calibrated trajectory uncertainty using conformal prediction, with online updates and inter-step dependency modeling, improving temporal calibration and interval sharpness across domains.

Abstract: Future trajectories play an important role across domains such as autonomous
driving, hurricane forecasting, and epidemic modeling, where practitioners
commonly generate ensemble paths by sampling probabilistic models or leveraging
multiple autoregressive predictors. While these trajectories reflect inherent
uncertainty, they are typically uncalibrated. We propose a unified framework
based on conformal prediction that transforms sampled trajectories into
calibrated prediction intervals with theoretical coverage guarantees. By
introducing a novel online update step and an optimization step that captures
inter-step dependencies, our method can produce discontinuous prediction
intervals around each trajectory, naturally capture temporal dependencies, and
yield sharper, more adaptive uncertainty estimates.

### [102] [Batching-Aware Joint Model Onloading and Offloading for Hierarchical Multi-Task Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13380)
*Seohyeon Cha,Kevin Chan,Gustavo de Veciana,Haris Vikalo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unified, efficient joint optimization framework (J3O) for multi-task edge inference that selects onloading models and offloading routes to maximize accuracy under memory, compute, and communication constraints, with near-optimal performance and scalable batching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Edge devices are resource-constrained but increasingly run multiple diverse tasks (e.g., detection, segmentation, depth estimation). Existing frameworks focus on single-task/single-model settings and ignore joint hosting and routing across a hierarchy (device-edge-cloud). There is a need for a scalable approach that jointly selects which models to run locally and how to route queries to maximize inference accuracy under resource limits.

Method: Formulate as a mixed-integer program. Propose J3O (Joint Optimization of Onloading and Offloading), an alternating algorithm: (i) greedily selects models to onload using Lagrangian-relaxed submodular optimization, (ii) computes optimal offloading via constrained linear programming. Extend with batching at the edge to handle heterogeneous task loads and improve scalability.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows J3O attains over 97% of the optimal accuracy while consuming less than 15% of the runtime of the optimal solver across multi-task benchmarks, demonstrating strong near-optimal performance with substantial speedups.

Conclusion: J3O provides a scalable, near-optimal solution for jointly deciding onloading and offloading in multi-task edge inference, accommodating batching and heterogeneous workloads, and is effective for real-world edge-cloud ecosystems.

Abstract: The growing demand for intelligent services on resource-constrained edge
devices has spurred the development of collaborative inference systems that
distribute workloads across end devices, edge servers, and the cloud. While
most existing frameworks focus on single-task, single-model scenarios, many
real-world applications (e.g., autonomous driving and augmented reality)
require concurrent execution of diverse tasks including detection,
segmentation, and depth estimation. In this work, we propose a unified
framework to jointly decide which multi-task models to deploy (onload) at
clients and edge servers, and how to route queries across the hierarchy
(offload) to maximize overall inference accuracy under memory, compute, and
communication constraints. We formulate this as a mixed-integer program and
introduce J3O (Joint Optimization of Onloading and Offloading), an alternating
algorithm that (i) greedily selects models to onload via Lagrangian-relaxed
submodular optimization and (ii) determines optimal offloading via constrained
linear programming. We further extend J3O to account for batching at the edge,
maintaining scalability under heterogeneous task loads. Experiments show J3O
consistently achieves over $97\%$ of the optimal accuracy while incurring less
than $15\%$ of the runtime required by the optimal solver across multi-task
benchmarks.

*Nooshin Bahador,Milad Lankarany*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A LOF-based outlier detection on spectro-temporal chirp features, paired with weighted spatial correlation, improves SOZ localization and shows higher concordance in successful surgical outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance seizure onset zone (SOZ) localization by combining data-driven unsupervised anomaly detection with spatially aware matching, addressing limitations of fixed clinically defined zones.

Method: Step 1: Unsupervised Outlier Detection using Local Outlier Factor (LOF) with adaptive neighborhood (N=20, contamination=0.2) on chirp features (onset frequency, offset frequency, duration). Step 2: Spatial Correlation Analysis using exact co-occurrence metrics and a weighted index similarity that incorporates hemispheric congruence and electrode proximity.

Result: LOF-based detection effectively identifies anomalous channels. Weighted index similarity (proximity-weighted) outperforms exact matching for SOZ localization. Performance (precision, recall, F1) peaks in seizure-free patients (Index Precision mean ≈ 0.903) and successful surgeries (≈ 0.865), with lower concordance in failure cases (≈ 0.460).

Conclusion: Chirp-based outlier detection combined with proximity-weighted spatial metrics provides a complementary, data-driven approach to SOZ localization, especially beneficial for patients with favorable surgical outcomes.

Abstract: This study presents a quantitative framework for evaluating the spatial
concordance between clinically defined seizure onset zones (SOZs) and
statistically anomalous channels identified through time-frequency analysis of
chirp events. The proposed pipeline employs a two-step methodology: (1)
Unsupervised Outlier Detection, where Local Outlier Factor (LOF) analysis with
adaptive neighborhood selection identifies anomalous channels based on
spectro-temporal features of chirp (Onset frequency, offset frequency, and
temporal duration); and (2) Spatial Correlation Analysis, which computes both
exact co-occurrence metrics and weighted index similarity, incorporating
hemispheric congruence and electrode proximity. Key findings demonstrate that
the LOF-based approach (N neighbors=20, contamination=0.2) effectively detects
outliers, with index matching (weighted by channel proximity) outperforming
exact matching in SOZ localization. Performance metrics (precision, recall, F1)
were highest for seizure-free patients (Index Precision mean: 0.903) and those
with successful surgical outcomes (Index Precision mean: 0.865), whereas
failure cases exhibited lower concordance (Index Precision mean: 0.460). The
key takeaway is that chirp-based outlier detection, combined with weighted
spatial metrics, provides a complementary method for SOZ localization,
particularly in patients with successful surgical outcomes.

*Kamran Chitsaz,Roshan Balaji,Quentin Fournier,Nirav Pravinbhai Bhatt,Sarath Chandar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NovoMolGen is a transformer-based Mol-LLM family pretrained on 1.5B molecules, revealing weak links between pretraining metrics and downstream performance while achieving state-of-the-art results in unconstrained and goal-directed molecule generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how standard NLP training aspects (representations, tokenization, model size, data scale) influence molecular generation, enabling more efficient and effective Mol-LLMs for de-novo design.

Method: Pretrain NovoMolGen on 1.5B molecules and conduct systematic analyses of input representations and tokenization, model scale, and dataset size; compare against prior Mol-LLMs and specialized generative models across unconstrained and goal-directed tasks; evaluate correlation between pretraining metrics and downstream generation performance.

Result: Weak correlation found between pretraining metrics and downstream performance, indicating molecular and NLP training dynamics differ; NovoMolGen achieves new state-of-the-art performance, outperforming previous Mol-LLMs and specialized models on both unconstrained and goal-directed generation tasks.

Conclusion: Molecular LLMs require bespoke training dynamics distinct from general NLP; NovoMolGen provides a robust foundation for efficient molecular generation and highlights the need to tailor representations and scales in Mol-LLMs for optimal performance.

Abstract: Designing de-novo molecules with desired property profiles requires efficient
exploration of the vast chemical space ranging from $10^{23}$ to $10^{60}$
possible synthesizable candidates. While various deep generative models have
been developed to design small molecules using diverse input representations,
Molecular Large Language Models (Mol-LLMs) based on string representations have
emerged as a scalable approach capable of exploring billions of molecules.
However, there remains limited understanding regarding how standard language
modeling practices such as textual representations, tokenization strategies,
model size, and dataset scale impact molecular generation performance. In this
work, we systematically investigate these critical aspects by introducing
NovoMolGen, a family of transformer-based foundation models pretrained on 1.5
billion molecules for de-novo molecule generation. Through extensive empirical
analyses, we identify a weak correlation between performance metrics measured
during pretraining and actual downstream performance, revealing important
distinctions between molecular and general NLP training dynamics. NovoMolGen
establishes new state-of-the-art results, substantially outperforming prior
Mol-LLMs and specialized generative models in both unconstrained and
goal-directed molecular generation tasks, thus providing a robust foundation
for advancing efficient and effective molecular modeling strategies.

### [105] [Decentralized Contextual Bandits with Network Adaptivity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13411)
*Chuyun Deng,Huiwen Jia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces two network-aware contextual linear bandit algorithms (NetLinUCB and Net-SGD-UCB) that share information via dynamic network weights to exploit shared structure while keeping local differences. They achieve sublinear regret O(√N) with reduced communication; NetLinUCB favors low-noise, fine-grained heterogeneity; Net-SGD-UCB handles high-dimensional, high-variance contexts; validated on simulated pricing tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address learning in networked contextual bandits where data is partially shared. Classical approaches are either fully centralized or fully isolated; there is a need to exploit shared structure across locations while accommodating local differences and reducing communication overhead.

Method: Develop two network-aware UCB algorithms, NetLinUCB and Net-SGD-UCB, that enable adaptive information sharing guided by dynamically updated network weights. Decompose learning into global and local components; agents share summaries about homogeneous features, reducing communication compared to full centralization; derive regret bounds showing improvement from O(N) to O(√N); NetLinUCB and Net-SGD-UCB offer complementary strengths depending on noise and dimensionality.

Result: Regret bounds show learning complexity reduced from O(N) to sublinear O(√N). Communication costs are lighter due to sharing only homogeneous-feature summaries. NetLinUCB performs well in low-noise, fine-grained heterogeneous settings, while Net-SGD-UCB is robust in high-dimensional, high-variance contexts. Effectiveness demonstrated in simulated pricing environments versus standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: The work provides a practical framework for networked contextual bandits with partial information sharing. By decomposing global/local learning and using network-guided adaptive sharing, it achieves lower regret and reduced communication. NetLinUCB and Net-SGD-UCB complement each other across regimes and are applicable to pricing and similar sequential decision problems.

Abstract: We consider contextual linear bandits over networks, a class of sequential
decision-making problems where learning occurs simultaneously across multiple
locations and the reward distributions share structural similarities while also
exhibiting local differences. While classical contextual bandits assume either
fully centralized data or entirely isolated learners, much remains unexplored
in networked environments when information is partially shared. In this paper,
we address this gap by developing two network-aware Upper Confidence Bound
(UCB) algorithms, NetLinUCB and Net-SGD-UCB, which enable adaptive information
sharing guided by dynamically updated network weights. Our approach decompose
learning into global and local components and as a result allow agents to
benefit from shared structure without full synchronization. Both algorithms
incur lighter communication costs compared to a fully centralized setting as
agents only share computed summaries regarding the homogeneous features. We
establish regret bounds showing that our methods reduce the learning complexity
associated with the shared structure from $O(N)$ to sublinear $O(\sqrt{N})$,
where $N$ is the size of the network. The two algorithms reveal complementary
strengths: NetLinUCB excels in low-noise regimes with fine-grained
heterogeneity, while Net-SGD-UCB is robust to high-dimensional, high-variance
contexts. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods across
simulated pricing environments compared to standard benchmarks.

### [106] [MAVIS: Multi-Objective Alignment via Value-Guided Inference-Time Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13415)
*Jeremy Carleton,Debajoy Mukherjee,Srinivas Shakkottai,Dileep Kalathil*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MAVIS offers a lightweight, inference-time approach to multi-objective alignment that tilts LLM outputs toward user-specified trade-offs using small value models, without fine-tuning the base model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable dynamic, user-controlled balancing of multiple, potentially conflicting objectives in LLM outputs without expensive per-objective fine-tuning of the base model.

Method: Train small value models, each representing a distinct objective. At inference, combine these value models with user-specified weights to form a tilting function that shifts the base model's output distribution toward the desired trade-offs. The value models are trained via a simple iterative algorithm that guarantees monotonic improvement of the KL-regularized policy.

Result: Empirically, MAVIS outperforms baselines that fine-tune per-objective models or combine them post hoc, and approaches the performance of idealized per-user fine-tuning.

Conclusion: MAVIS provides a practical, flexible inference-time solution for multi-objective alignment that avoids changing base model weights while delivering competitive and adaptable performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across diverse
applications that demand balancing multiple, often conflicting, objectives --
such as helpfulness, harmlessness, or humor. Aligning outputs to user-specific
preferences in such multi-objective settings typically requires fine-tuning
models for each objective or preference configuration, which is computationally
expensive and inflexible. We introduce MAVIS -- Multi-Objective Alignment via
Value-Guided Inference-Time Search -- a lightweight inference-time alignment
framework that enables dynamic control over LLM behavior without modifying the
base model's weights. MAVIS trains a set of small value models, each
corresponding to a distinct objective. At inference time, these value models
are combined using user-specified weights to produce a tilting function that
adjusts the base model's output distribution toward desired trade-offs. The
value models are trained using a simple iterative algorithm that ensures
monotonic improvement of the KL-regularized policy. We show empirically that
MAVIS outperforms baselines that fine-tune per-objective models and combine
them post hoc, and even approaches the performance of the idealized setting
where models are fine-tuned for a user's exact preferences.

### [107] [EventTSF: Event-Aware Non-Stationary Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13434)
*Yunfeng Ge,Ming Jin,Yiji Zhao,Hongyan Li,Bo Du,Chang Xu,Shirui Pan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces EventTSF, an autoregressive diffusion-based framework for integrating textual events with time series to improve non-stationary forecasting; achieves substantial accuracy gains and faster training on 8 datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-stationary time series are often influenced by textual events, and relying on a single modality limits contextual knowledge and model performance. The paper identifies three core challenges: fine-grained synchronization between discrete textual events and continuous time series, semantic uncertainty from textual content, and misalignment between textual embeddings and multi-resolution temporal patterns.

Method: Proposes EventTSF with autoregressive diffusion and flow matching at each step, guided by event semantics. It uses a multimodal U-shaped diffusion transformer to fuse temporal and textual modalities across multiple resolutions, enabling end-to-end autoregressive forecasting conditioned on historical series and textual events.

Result: Outperforms 12 baselines across 8 synthetic and real datasets, achieving about 10.7% higher forecasting accuracy and 1.13x faster training efficiency.

Conclusion: EventTSF demonstrates effective fine-grained multimodal interactions for non-stationary forecasting, addressing synchronization, uncertainty, and cross-resolution alignment. It shows robust gains and suggests avenues for extending multimodal integration to additional modalities and real-time inference.

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a vital role in critical domains like energy
and transportation, where non-stationary dynamics are deeply intertwined with
events in other modalities such as texts. However, incorporating natural
language-based external events to improve non-stationary forecasting remains
largely unexplored, as most approaches still rely on a single modality,
resulting in limited contextual knowledge and model underperformance. Enabling
fine-grained multimodal interactions between temporal and textual data is
challenged by three fundamental issues: (1) the difficulty of fine-grained
synchronization between time-varying discrete textual events and continuous
time series; (2) the inherent temporal uncertainty introduced by textual
semantics; and (3) the misalignment between textual event embeddings and
multi-resolution temporal patterns. In this work, we address these challenges
by introducing event-aware non-stationary time series forecasting (EventTSF),
an autoregressive generation framework that integrates historical time series
with textual events to make subsequent forecasts. Specifically, EventTSF uses
autoregressive diffusion with flow matching at each step to capture nuanced
temporal-event interactions. To handle event-induced uncertainty, flow matching
timesteps are adaptively controlled according to event semantic signals. The
underlying denoiser employs a multimodal U-shaped diffusion transformer that
efficiently fuses temporal and textual modalities across different resolutions.
Extensive experiments on 8 synthetic and real-world datasets show that EventTSF
outperforms 12 baselines across diverse event-aware non-stationary time series
forecasting scenarios, achieving substantial improvements of 10.7% higher
forecasting accuracy and $1.13\times$ faster training efficiency.

*Jiayu Fang,Zhiqi Shao,S T Boris Choy,Junbin Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SVDformer combines singular value decomposition with Transformer-based attention to learn direction-aware representations on directed graphs, enabling learnable low-/high-pass filtering and explicit preservation of edge directionality, achieving state-of-the-art node classification on six benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Directed GNNs struggle to simultaneously capture directional semantics and global structural patterns due to isotropic aggregation and localized filtering; there is a need to jointly exploit spectral (SVD) components and multi-hop, direction-sensitive interactions.

Method: Refine singular value embeddings via multi-head self-attention to emphasize informative spectral components and suppress high-frequency noise; treat singular vectors as directional bases and singular values as scaling factors; use Transformer attention to model multi-scale interactions between incoming/outgoing edge patterns, enabling learnable low-pass/high-pass filtering without explicit spectral kernels and preserving edge directionality during propagation.

Result: Empirical results on six directed graph benchmarks show SVDformer consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs and direction-aware baselines on node classification tasks.

Conclusion: The paper presents a new paradigm by uniting SVD-based spectral components with Transformer-based direction-aware propagation, yielding more expressive representations for directed graphs and strong empirical performance.

Abstract: Directed graphs are widely used to model asymmetric relationships in
real-world systems. However, existing directed graph neural networks often
struggle to jointly capture directional semantics and global structural
patterns due to their isotropic aggregation mechanisms and localized filtering
mechanisms. To address this limitation, this paper proposes SVDformer, a novel
framework that synergizes SVD and Transformer architecture for direction-aware
graph representation learning. SVDformer first refines singular value
embeddings through multi-head self-attention, adaptively enhancing critical
spectral components while suppressing high-frequency noise. This enables
learnable low-pass/high-pass graph filtering without requiring spectral
kernels. Furthermore, by treating singular vectors as directional projection
bases and singular values as scaling factors, SVDformer uses the Transformer to
model multi-scale interactions between incoming/outgoing edge patterns through
attention weights, thereby explicitly preserving edge directionality during
feature propagation. Extensive experiments on six directed graph benchmarks
demonstrate that SVDformer consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs and
direction-aware baselines on node classification tasks, establishing a new
paradigm for learning representations on directed graphs.

TL;DR: Metalearning-driven AutoML that dynamically designs search spaces using historical meta-knowledge to accelerate optimization, with strong runtime gains and controlled performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AutoML methods face high computational cost from broad search spaces and optimization strategies, risking inefficiency and potential overfitting. The paper aims to reduce search space and search time while maintaining predictive performance.

Method: Leverages historical meta-knowledge to identify promising regions of the AutoML search space. Applies dynamic search-space reduction to Random Search and Auto-Sklearn-like systems, examining meta-feature selection and meta-model explainability, and discusses trade-offs of reducing search spaces.

Result: Reported runtime reduction of 89% for Random Search. Substantial reduction in search space (e.g., 1.8/13 preprocessor and 4.3/16 classifier options). Competitive performance when integrated with Auto-Sklearn, with reduced search space. Insights into meta-feature selection and meta-model explainability.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that meta-learning can effectively guide search-space design in AutoML, yielding significant speedups with limited performance loss, and highlights considerations for meta-feature selection and explainability in such frameworks.

Abstract: Automated machine learning (AutoML) has democratized the design of machine
learning based systems, by automating model selection, hyperparameter tuning
and feature engineering. However, the high computational cost associated with
traditional search and optimization strategies, such as Random Search, Particle
Swarm Optimization and Bayesian Optimization, remains a significant challenge.
Moreover, AutoML systems typically explore a large search space, which can lead
to overfitting. This paper introduces a metalearning method for dynamically
designing search spaces for AutoML system. The proposed method uses historical
metaknowledge to select promising regions of the search space, accelerating the
optimization process. According to experiments conducted for this study, the
proposed method can reduce runtime by 89\% in Random Search and search space by
(1.8/13 preprocessor and 4.3/16 classifier), without compromising significant
predictive performance. Moreover, the proposed method showed competitive
performance when adapted to Auto-Sklearn, reducing its search space.
Furthermore, this study encompasses insights into meta-feature selection,
meta-model explainability, and the trade-offs inherent in search space
reduction strategies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ASAP is an unsupervised post-training method that adaptively tunes learning rates for online label shift by measuring the cosine distance between consecutive softmax outputs, mapped to a bounded range, enabling fast, lightweight adaptation without labels or ensembles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online label shift degrades model performance; existing adaptation methods often need labels, model ensembles, or historical inputs, which limits practicality. A lightweight, label-free solution could significantly improve real-world deployment.

Method: Compute the cosine distance between the current and previous unlabeled (softmax) outputs. Map this distance into a bounded range to derive a dynamic learning rate; apply this during post-training-style adaptation using only the previous softmax output, with no labels, ensembles, or past inputs.

Result: ASAP consistently improves accuracy and efficiency across multiple datasets and shift scenarios, demonstrating practical unsupervised adaptation in real-world settings.

Conclusion: A simple, effective unsupervised adaptation mechanism for online label shift that avoids labels and ensembles, offering fast, lightweight learning-rate control during post-training adaptation.

Abstract: In real-world applications, machine learning models face online label shift,
where label distributions change over time. Effective adaptation requires
careful learning rate selection: too low slows adaptation and too high causes
instability. We propose ASAP (Adaptive Shift Aware Post-training), which
dynamically adjusts the learning rate by computing the cosine distance between
current and previous unlabeled outputs and mapping it within a bounded range.
ASAP requires no labels, model ensembles, or past inputs, using only the
previous softmax output for fast, lightweight adaptation. Experiments across
multiple datasets and shift scenarios show ASAP consistently improves accuracy
and efficiency, making it practical for unsupervised model adaptation.

*Ruobing Jiang,Mengzhe Liu,Haobing Liu,Yanwei Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HCAL for Hierarchical Multi-Label Classification via prototype contrastive learning and adaptive task weighting to enforce hierarchical consistency; adds prototype perturbation and a Hierarchical Violation Rate metric; shows improved accuracy and fewer violations on three datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HMC suffers from structural inconsistencies and imbalanced optimization in multi-task learning. Need methods that enforce hierarchy, adapt losses, and robust decision boundaries.

Method: Proposes HCAL: an MTL-based classifier with prototype contrastive learning, explicit label modeling via prototypes, and feature aggregation from child to parent. Uses adaptive loss weighting based on task convergence rates. Adds prototype perturbation (noise) to expand decision boundaries. Introduces Hierarchical Violation Rate (HVR) to measure hierarchical consistency and generalization.

Result: Empirical results on three datasets show higher accuracy and lower HVR compared to baselines, indicating improved hierarchical consistency and generalization.

Conclusion: HCAL advances hierarchical multi-label classification by integrating prototype-based semantic modeling, adaptive optimization, and robustness techniques, with a dedicated metric (HVR) to quantify hierarchical consistency; promising improvements over baselines.

Abstract: Hierarchical Multi-Label Classification (HMC) faces critical challenges in
maintaining structural consistency and balancing loss weighting in Multi-Task
Learning (MTL). In order to address these issues, we propose a classifier
called HCAL based on MTL integrated with prototype contrastive learning and
adaptive task-weighting mechanisms. The most significant advantage of our
classifier is semantic consistency including both prototype with explicitly
modeling label and feature aggregation from child classes to parent classes.
The other important advantage is an adaptive loss-weighting mechanism that
dynamically allocates optimization resources by monitoring task-specific
convergence rates. It effectively resolves the "one-strong-many-weak"
optimization bias inherent in traditional MTL approaches. To further enhance
robustness, a prototype perturbation mechanism is formulated by injecting
controlled noise into prototype to expand decision boundaries. Additionally, we
formalize a quantitative metric called Hierarchical Violation Rate (HVR) as to
evaluate hierarchical consistency and generalization. Extensive experiments
across three datasets demonstrate both the higher classification accuracy and
reduced hierarchical violation rate of the proposed classifier over baseline
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Provide interpretable, low-dimensional visualizations of chirp features to support clinical decision making and stratification, while addressing t-SNE crowding and enabling local feature attribution.

Method: Use a chirp-feature dataset (temporal, spectral, frequency metrics). Apply t-SNE to obtain 2D embeddings preserving local structure while mitigating crowding. Train four classifiers (Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors) under stratified 5-fold cross-validation for three tasks: (1) distinguishing clinical success vs failure/no-resection, (2) separating high-difficulty vs low-difficulty cases, (3) identifying optimal cases (successful outcomes with minimal clinical difficulty). Apply SHAP explanations to models predicting t-SNE coordinates to generate feature influence maps on the embedding space.

Result: RF and k-NN outperform others, achieving up to 88.8% accuracy in optimal-case detection. SHAP-based attribution reveals spatially localized feature importance within the embedding, highlighting which chirp attributes drive clustering and class separation.

Conclusion: The integrated framework demonstrates the potential of interpretable embeddings combined with local feature attribution to support clinical stratification and decision-making.

Abstract: This study presents a pipeline leveraging t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor

diverse outcome scenarios. The dataset, comprising chirp-based temporal,
spectral, and frequency metrics. Using t-SNE, local neighborhood relationships
were preserved while addressing the crowding problem through Student
t-distribution-based similarity optimization. Three classification tasks were
formulated on the 2D t-SNE embeddings: (1) distinguishing clinical success from
failure/no-resection, (2) separating high-difficulty from low-difficulty cases,
and (3) identifying optimal cases, defined as successful outcomes with minimal
clinical difficulty. Four classifiers, namely, Random Forests, Support Vector
Machines, Logistic Regression, and k-Nearest Neighbors, were trained and
evaluated using stratified 5-fold cross-validation. Across tasks, the Random
Forest and k-NN classifiers demonstrated superior performance, achieving up to
88.8% accuracy in optimal case detection (successful outcomes with minimal
clinical difficulty). Additionally, feature influence sensitivity maps were
generated using SHAP explanations applied to model predicting t-SNE
coordinates, revealing spatially localized feature importance within the
embedding space. These maps highlighted how specific chirp attributes drive
regional clustering and class separation, offering insights into the latent
structure of the data. The integrated framework showcases the potential of
interpretable embeddings and local feature attribution for clinical

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DyMixOp is a neural operator framework for PDEs that uses inertial manifold theory and a Local-Global-Mixing (LGM) transformation to map infinite-dimensional nonlinear PDE dynamics into a finite-dimensional latent space, capturing essential nonlinear interactions and reducing spectral bias; it delivers state-of-the-art accuracy and efficiency, notably in convection-dominated regimes (up to 86.7% error reduction).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the fundamental challenge of converting nonlinear, potentially non-linearizable PDE dynamics (often requiring infinite-dimensional representations) into a tractable, finite latent space for neural operators while preserving key nonlinear interactions, interpretability, and computational efficiency.

Method: Introduce DyMixOp with a Local-Global-Mixing (LGM) transformation inspired by convection dynamics to capture fine-scale details and nonlinear interactions; ground the approach in inertial manifold theory to project dynamics onto a finite-dimensional latent space; implement a dynamics-informed architecture that stacks multiple LGM layers to approximate both linear and nonlinear dynamics and model temporal evolution; evaluate on diverse PDE benchmarks.

Result: DyMixOp achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse PDE benchmarks, with significantly reduced prediction errors, particularly in convection-dominated scenarios, reporting improvements up to 86.7%; maintains computational efficiency and scalability.

Conclusion: DyMixOp provides a principled, physics-informed neural operator framework that transforms infinite-dimensional PDE dynamics into a finite latent space via LGM, mitigating spectral bias and preserving essential nonlinear interactions; demonstrates strong empirical performance and potential for scalable PDE modeling.

Abstract: A primary challenge in using neural networks to approximate nonlinear
dynamical systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) is
transforming these systems into a suitable format, especially when dealing with
non-linearizable dynamics or the need for infinite-dimensional spaces for
linearization. This paper introduces DyMixOp, a novel neural operator framework
for PDEs that integrates insights from complex dynamical systems to address
this challenge. Grounded in inertial manifold theory, DyMixOp transforms
infinite-dimensional nonlinear PDE dynamics into a finite-dimensional latent
space, establishing a structured foundation that maintains essential nonlinear
interactions and enhances physical interpretability. A key innovation is the
Local-Global-Mixing (LGM) transformation, inspired by convection dynamics in
turbulence. This transformation effectively captures both fine-scale details
and nonlinear interactions, while mitigating spectral bias commonly found in
existing neural operators. The framework is further strengthened by a
dynamics-informed architecture that connects multiple LGM layers to approximate
linear and nonlinear dynamics, reflecting the temporal evolution of dynamical
systems. Experimental results across diverse PDE benchmarks demonstrate that
DyMixOp achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly reducing
prediction errors, particularly in convection-dominated scenarios reaching up
to 86.7\%, while maintaining computational efficiency and scalability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantifying and visually conveying predictive uncertainty in NN-based particle trajectory forecasting is challenging yet essential for trustworthiness in critical applications.

Method: Proposes a superelliptical tube to represent uncertainty around NN-predicted trajectories and integrates standard UQ methods—Deep Ensembles, MC Dropout, and SWAG—to estimate uncertainty; demonstrates computational efficiency and utility on synthetic and simulation datasets.

Result: The uncertainty tube effectively communicates nonuniform, potentially asymmetric uncertainty and is compatible with multiple uncertainty quantification techniques; its computational efficiency is highlighted through demonstration on datasets.

Conclusion: The uncertainty tube provides a practical, intuitive visualization for NN predictive uncertainty in particle trajectories, combining established UQ methods with a novel geometric representation to enhance trust and interpretability in practical deployments.

Abstract: Predicting particle trajectories with neural networks (NNs) has substantially
enhanced many scientific and engineering domains. However, effectively
quantifying and visualizing the inherent uncertainty in predictions remains
challenging. Without an understanding of the uncertainty, the reliability of NN
models in applications where trustworthiness is paramount is significantly
compromised. This paper introduces the uncertainty tube, a novel,
computationally efficient visualization method designed to represent this
uncertainty in NN-derived particle paths. Our key innovation is the design and
implementation of a superelliptical tube that accurately captures and
intuitively conveys nonsymmetric uncertainty. By integrating well-established
uncertainty quantification techniques, such as Deep Ensembles, Monte Carlo
Dropout (MC Dropout), and Stochastic Weight Averaging-Gaussian (SWAG), we
demonstrate the practical utility of the uncertainty tube, showcasing its
application on both synthetic and simulation datasets.

### [115] [Explainability of Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13529)
*Andrés Páez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The abstract distinguishes two notions of opacity in AI—epistemic opacity due to complex models (black boxes) and intentional opacity from proprietary concealment—and surveys explainable AI methods, concluding that XAI faces significant ongoing challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Opacity in ML hinders ethical AI, impacting trust, accountability, and stakeholder understanding; clarifying its sources is essential to inform design of transparent systems.

Method: Conceptual analysis of opacity types and a literature review of explainable AI approaches, organized into two parts: (1) the two meanings of opacity and their ethical implications; (2) methods to overcome opacity and remaining challenges.

Result: Opacity arises from both technical complexity and deliberate concealment; while XAI methods exist to address technical opacity, they do not fully resolve the opacity problem, and several challenges persist in making AI explanations reliable and usable.

Conclusion: Disentangle the two opacity sources and advance XAI alongside ethical frameworks to improve transparency and accountability in AI systems.

Abstract: The opaqueness of many complex machine learning algorithms is often mentioned
as one of the main obstacles to the ethical development of artificial
intelligence (AI). But what does it mean for an algorithm to be opaque? Highly
complex algorithms such as artificial neural networks process enormous volumes
of data in parallel along multiple hidden layers of interconnected nodes,
rendering their inner workings epistemically inaccessible to any human being,
including their designers and developers; they are "black boxes" for all their
stakeholders. But opaqueness is not always the inevitable result of technical
complexity. Sometimes, the way an algorithm works is intentionally hidden from
view for proprietary reasons, especially in commercial automated decision
systems, creating an entirely different type of opaqueness. In the first part
of the chapter, we will examine these two ways of understanding opacity and the
ethical implications that stem from each of them. In the second part, we
explore the different explanatory methods that have been developed in computer
science to overcome an AI system's technical opaqueness. As the analysis shows,
explainable AI (XAI) still faces numerous challenges.

### [116] [MuFlex: A Scalable, Physics-based Platform for Multi-Building Flexibility Analysis and Coordination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13532)
*Ziyan Wu,Ivan Korolija,Rui Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MuFlex is an open-source, multi-building RL benchmarking platform that uses EnergyPlus and Gym to coordinate demand flexibility across buildings; demonstrated on four-office-building case with Soft Actor-Critic reducing peak demand while preserving IAQ.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for physically accurate, multi-building benchmarking platforms for RL in building energy management. Existing testbeds are typically single-building, rely on simplified models or data-driven approaches, and constrain inputs/outputs, hindering fair benchmarking across diverse control scenarios. MuFlex addresses these gaps by enabling synchronous exchange among energy models and flexible RL integration.

Method: Development of MuFlex, a scalable platform that synchronizes EnergyPlus building models with an OpenAI Gym interface for modular RL. Demonstrated via a case study coordinating demand flexibility across four office buildings using the Soft Actor-Critic algorithm with carefully tuned hyperparameters.

Result: Aggregation of the four buildings' flexibility reduced total peak demand below a specified threshold while maintaining indoor environmental quality.

Conclusion: MuFlex provides a scalable, open-source benchmarking platform for multi-building demand-flexibility coordination, enabling fair benchmarking and RL research across diverse scenarios, and proving the viability of coordinating building systems to reduce peak demand without compromising comfort.

Abstract: With the increasing penetration of renewable generation on the power grid,
maintaining system balance requires coordinated demand flexibility from
aggregations of buildings. Reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely explored
for building controls because of its model-free nature. Open-source simulation
testbeds are essential not only for training RL agents but also for fairly
benchmarking control strategies. However, most building-sector testbeds target
single buildings; multi-building platforms are relatively limited and typically
rely on simplified models (e.g., Resistance-Capacitance) or data-driven
approaches, which lack the ability to fully capture the physical intricacies
and intermediate variables necessary for interpreting control performance.
Moreover, these platforms often impose fixed inputs, outputs, and model
formats, restricting their applicability as benchmarking tools across diverse
control scenarios. To address these gaps, MuFlex, a scalable, open-source
platform for benchmarking and testing control strategies for multi-building
flexibility coordination, was developed in this study. MuFlex enables
synchronous information exchange across EnergyPlus building models and adheres
to the latest OpenAI Gym interface, providing a modular, standardized RL
implementation. The platform capabilities were demonstrated in a case study
coordinating demand flexibility across four office buildings using the Soft
Actor-Critic algorithm with carefully fine-tuned hyperparameters. The results
show that aggregating the four buildings flexibility reduced total peak demand
below a specified threshold while maintaining indoor environmental quality.

*Rituparna Datta,Jiaming Cui,Gregory R. Madden,Anil Vullikanti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CALYPSO is a hybrid neural-network and mechanistic metapopulation model to forecast MRSA spread across healthcare and community settings, using diverse data to produce interpretable, multi-resolution forecasts and counterfactual policy analyses; it outperforms ML baselines by ~4.5%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRSA poses a significant hospital and long-term care burden. Existing models either lack epidemiological interpretability or struggle to incorporate diverse data, limiting forecasting accuracy and policy evaluation.

Method: A hybrid CALYPSO framework that combines neural networks with mechanistic metapopulation models. It learns region- and time-specific parameters governing MRSA spread from patient-level insurance claims, commuting, and healthcare transfer data, enabling forecasts at county, facility, region, and state levels and supporting counterfactual analyses of infection control policies.

Result: Statewide forecasting performance improves by more than 4.5% over machine-learning baselines; the model also identifies high-risk regions and cost-effective resource allocation strategies for infection prevention.

Conclusion: CALYPSO delivers accurate, interpretable, multi-resolution forecasts and policy-analysis capabilities for MRSA spread, addressing limitations of prior ML-only or mechanistic-only approaches.

Abstract: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a critical public
health threat within hospitals as well as long-term care facilities. Better
understanding of MRSA risks, evaluation of interventions and forecasting MRSA
rates are important public health problems. Existing forecasting models rely on
statistical or neural network approaches, which lack epidemiological
interpretability, and have limited performance. Mechanistic epidemic models are
difficult to calibrate and limited in incorporating diverse datasets. We
present CALYPSO, a hybrid framework that integrates neural networks with
mechanistic metapopulation models to capture the spread dynamics of infectious
diseases (i.e., MRSA) across healthcare and community settings. Our model
leverages patient-level insurance claims, commuting data, and healthcare
transfer patterns to learn region- and time-specific parameters governing MRSA
spread. This enables accurate, interpretable forecasts at multiple spatial
resolutions (county, healthcare facility, region, state) and supports
counterfactual analyses of infection control policies and outbreak risks. We
also show that CALYPSO improves statewide forecasting performance by over 4.5%
compared to machine learning baselines, while also identifying high-risk
regions and cost-effective strategies for allocating infection prevention
resources.

### [118] [Collapsing ROC approach for risk prediction research on both common and rare variants](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13552)
*Changshuai Wei,Qing Lu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes collapsing ROC (CROC) for risk prediction incorporating both common and rare variants; shows CROC outperforms FROC and common-only models, achieving AUC around 0.60 on a GAW17 mini-exome dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve genetic risk prediction by including rare variants; common-variant approaches lack sufficient accuracy for clinical use; need comprehensive strategies.

Method: Introduce CROC, an extension of FROC with new handling for rare variants; evaluate on 533 SNPs from 37 genes; compare against FROC and models with decreasing numbers of common variants; extreme scenario with only rare variants.

Result: CROC with all SNPs: AUC 0.605 vs FROC 0.585; with fewer common variants, CROC outperforms FROC; with only rare variants, CROC AUC 0.603 vs FROC 0.524.

Conclusion: CROC offers a more accurate framework for risk prediction by aggregating information from both common and rare variants; particularly advantageous when common variants are sparse; supports broader integration of rare variants into predictive models.

Abstract: Risk prediction that capitalizes on emerging genetic findings holds great
promise for improving public health and clinical care. However, recent risk
prediction research has shown that predictive tests formed on existing common
genetic loci, including those from genome-wide association studies, have lacked
sufficient accuracy for clinical use. Because most rare variants on the genome
have not yet been studied for their role in risk prediction, future disease
prediction discoveries should shift toward a more comprehensive risk prediction
strategy that takes into account both common and rare variants. We are
proposing a collapsing receiver operating characteristic CROC approach for risk
prediction research on both common and rare variants. The new approach is an
extension of a previously developed forward ROC FROC approach, with additional
procedures for handling rare variants. The approach was evaluated through the
use of 533 single-nucleotide polymorphisms SNPs in 37 candidate genes from the
Genetic Analysis Workshop 17 mini-exome data set. We found that a prediction
model built on all SNPs gained more accuracy AUC = 0.605 than one built on
common variants alone AUC = 0.585. We further evaluated the performance of two
approaches by gradually reducing the number of common variants in the analysis.
We found that the CROC method attained more accuracy than the FROC method when
the number of common variants in the data decreased. In an extreme scenario,
when there are only rare variants in the data, the CROC reached an AUC value of
0.603, whereas the FROC had an AUC value of 0.524.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GenHAI is a probabilistic generative model for sequences of MRSA test results during hospitalization, enabling predictive, causal, and counterfactual analyses to help hospital administrators mitigate MRSA risk; evaluated on two real-world datasets against baselines with favorable results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRSA remains a high-risk antimicrobial resistance threat, especially in hospitalized patients due to comorbidities, immunosuppression, antibiotic exposure, and contact with contaminated workers/equipment. There is a need for models that support predictive, causal, and counterfactual reasoning to inform risk mitigation and hospital policies.

Method: Introduction of GenHAI, a generative probabilistic model (probabilistic programming) to model sequences of MRSA test outcomes within a single hospitalization. The model supports predictive, causal, and counterfactual analyses and is evaluated against discriminative and generative ML models on two real-world datasets.

Result: Empirical evaluation on two real-world datasets shows that GenHAI demonstrates efficacy relative to baselines, illustrating its potential for predictive, causal, and counterfactual reasoning about MRSA infection risk within hospital stays.

Conclusion: GenHAI provides a flexible, probabilistic framework to analyze MRSA test-result sequences during hospitalization, enabling hospital administrators to answer predictive, causal, and counterfactual questions for risk mitigation, with empirical support from two real-world datasets.

Abstract: The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in 2019, designated
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) as a serious antimicrobial
resistance threat. The risk of acquiring MRSA and suffering life-threatening
consequences due to it remains especially high for hospitalized patients due to
a unique combination of factors, including: co-morbid conditions, immuno
suppression, antibiotic use, and risk of contact with contaminated hospital
workers and equipment. In this paper, we present a novel generative
probabilistic model, GenHAI, for modeling sequences of MRSA test results
outcomes for patients during a single hospitalization. This model can be used
to answer many important questions from the perspectives of hospital
administrators for mitigating the risk of MRSA infections. Our model is based
on the probabilistic programming paradigm, and can be used to approximately
answer a variety of predictive, causal, and counterfactual questions. We
demonstrate the efficacy of our model by comparing it against discriminative
and generative machine learning models using two real-world datasets.

### [120] [A Generalized Learning Framework for Self-Supervised Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13596)
*Lingyu Si,Jingyao Wang,Wenwen Qiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GLF generalizes SSCL into aligning and constraining parts; unifies BYOL, Barlow Twins, SwAV; introduces Adaptive Distribution Calibration (ADC) to induce intra-class compactness and inter-class separability without labels; theory and experiments show ADC's superiority.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SSCL lacks label information, making the design of a constraining objective difficult. A unified framework can reveal design principles and a label-free way to enforce class-discriminative structure. ADC addresses this by adaptively calibrating sample distributions to promote intra-class compactness and inter-class separability.

Method: Introduce Generalized Learning Framework (GLF) with aligning and constraining parts; show BYOL, Barlow Twins, and SwAV fit GLF with different constraining components; propose Adaptive Distribution Calibration (ADC) as a plug‑and‑play module that iteratively captures anchor–sample dynamics and calibrates distances so that proximity in input space reflects in feature space.

Result: Theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation indicate ADC improves intra-class compactness and inter-class separability, yielding superior representations and downstream performance compared to baselines.

Conclusion: GLF provides a unifying view of SSCL methods; ADC offers a practical, theoretically grounded, plug‑and‑play constraining mechanism that performs well in label-free settings.

Abstract: Self-supervised contrastive learning (SSCL) has recently demonstrated
superiority in multiple downstream tasks. In this paper, we generalize the
standard SSCL methods to a Generalized Learning Framework (GLF) consisting of
two parts: the aligning part and the constraining part. We analyze three
existing SSCL methods: BYOL, Barlow Twins, and SwAV, and show that they can be
unified under GLF with different choices of the constraining part. We further
propose empirical and theoretical analyses providing two insights into
designing the constraining part of GLF: intra-class compactness and inter-class
separability, which measure how well the feature space preserves the class
information of the inputs. However, since SSCL can not use labels, it is
challenging to design a constraining part that satisfies these properties. To
address this issue, we consider inducing intra-class compactness and
inter-class separability by iteratively capturing the dynamic relationship
between anchor and other samples and propose a plug-and-play method called
Adaptive Distribution Calibration (ADC) to ensure that samples that are near or
far from the anchor point in the original input space are closer or further
away from the anchor point in the feature space. Both the theoretical analysis
and the empirical evaluation demonstrate the superiority of ADC.

TL;DR: Learning continuous distributions via probabilistic inference over quantized, discrete parameter spaces using probabilistic circuits; scales to 2D densities and quantized networks with interpretable behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantized/low-precision arithmetic enables scalable large-model deployments. There is a need to perform probabilistic reasoning in discrete parameter spaces that arise from quantization, offering interpretable, scalable alternatives to full-precision methods.

Method: Propose probabilistic inference over discrete parameters using probabilistic circuits to model 2D densities and quantized neural networks. Develop a tractable learning approach that leverages the discrete parameter space to approximate continuous distributions and perform efficient inference.

Result: Demonstrates inference efficiency and accuracy across various models, showing that discrete-parameter probabilistic computations can yield scalable, interpretable results without sacrificing performance.

Conclusion: The work advances scalable, interpretable ML by exploiting discrete approximations for probabilistic computations, enabling continuous-distribution learning within quantized frameworks and providing insights into model behavior.

Abstract: The machine learning community has recently put effort into quantized or
low-precision arithmetics to scale large models. This paper proposes performing
probabilistic inference in the quantized, discrete parameter space created by
these representations, effectively enabling us to learn a continuous
distribution using discrete parameters. We consider both 2D densities and
quantized neural networks, where we introduce a tractable learning approach
using probabilistic circuits. This method offers a scalable solution to manage
complex distributions and provides clear insights into model behavior. We
validate our approach with various models, demonstrating inference efficiency
without sacrificing accuracy. This work advances scalable, interpretable
machine learning by utilizing discrete approximations for probabilistic
computations.

### [122] [Bounding Causal Effects and Counterfactuals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13607)
*Tobias Maringgele*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Systematic comparison and extension of partial-identification bounding methods for causal inference, with a unified framework, decision guidance, ML-based method selection, and an open-source package (CausalBoundingEngine).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Partial identification offers robust causal bounds under weak assumptions, but methods are fragmented and hard to apply; practitioners need practical guidance and empirical benchmarks.

Method: Implemented, extended, and unified symbolic, optimization-based, and information-theoretic bounding methods; extended an entropy-bounded method to counterfactual queries like the Probability of Necessity and Sufficiency (PNS); conducted thousands of randomized simulations across discrete and continuous data-generating processes; developed a practical decision tree for algorithm selection and trained a machine-learning model to predict the best-performing method based on observable data characteristics; all implementations released in an open-source Python package, CausalBoundingEngine.

Result: Assessed bound tightness, computational efficiency, and robustness to assumption violations; produced actionable guidance and a data-driven method-selection tool; created a unified interface to apply and compare bounding methods.

Conclusion: This work enhances the practicality of partial identification by providing systematic evaluation, methodological extensions, and accessible tooling, enabling robust causal analysis under weaker assumptions.

Abstract: Causal inference often hinges on strong assumptions - such as no unmeasured
confounding or perfect compliance - that are rarely satisfied in practice.
Partial identification offers a principled alternative: instead of relying on
unverifiable assumptions to estimate causal effects precisely, it derives
bounds that reflect the uncertainty inherent in the data. Despite its
theoretical appeal, partial identification remains underutilized in applied
work, in part due to the fragmented nature of existing methods and the lack of
practical guidance. This thesis addresses these challenges by systematically
comparing a diverse set of bounding algorithms across multiple causal
scenarios. We implement, extend, and unify state-of-the-art methods - including
symbolic, optimization-based, and information-theoretic approaches - within a
common evaluation framework. In particular, we propose an extension of a
recently introduced entropy-bounded method, making it applicable to
counterfactual queries such as the Probability of Necessity and Sufficiency
(PNS). Our empirical study spans thousands of randomized simulations involving
both discrete and continuous data-generating processes. We assess each method
in terms of bound tightness, computational efficiency, and robustness to
assumption violations. To support practitioners, we distill our findings into a
practical decision tree for algorithm selection and train a machine learning
model to predict the best-performing method based on observable data
characteristics.
  All implementations are released as part of an open-source Python package,
CausalBoundingEngine, which enables users to apply and compare bounding methods
through a unified interface.

### [123] [Towards a Larger Model via One-Shot Federated Learning on Heterogeneous Client Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13625)
*Wenxuan Ye,Xueli An,Onur Ayan,Junfan Wang,Xueqiang Yan,Georg Carle*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedOL enables one-shot, knowledge-distillation-based federated learning to build a larger server model using only clients' predictions on unlabeled public data, accommodating heterogeneous client models and reducing communication; iterative pseudo-label refinement mitigates local-data bias, yielding improved performance in simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy constraints prevent sharing raw data; FL requires uniform models and many rounds, which is inefficient for heterogeneous, resource-constrained clients; need a cost-effective, privacy-preserving method to leverage private data without heavy client computation or communication.

Method: One-shot distillation: clients send only predictions on a public unlabeled dataset; server trains a larger consolidated model using a specialized objective with iterative pseudo-label refinement and tailored pseudo-label generation and knowledge distillation that fuses diverse client knowledge while allowing heterogeneous architectures.

Result: Simulations show FedOL significantly outperforms existing baselines; reduces communication overhead; enables effective integration of diverse client knowledge; demonstrates cost-effectiveness for mobile networks with private data and limited resources.

Conclusion: FedOL offers a practical, privacy-preserving, one-shot federated learning approach that accommodates heterogeneous client models and reduces communication, delivering improved performance over baselines in realistic simulations.

Abstract: Large models, renowned for superior performance, outperform smaller ones even
without billion-parameter scales. While mobile network servers have ample
computational resources to support larger models than client devices, privacy
constraints prevent clients from directly sharing their raw data. Federated
Learning (FL) enables decentralized clients to collaboratively train a shared
model by exchanging model parameters instead of transmitting raw data. Yet, it
requires a uniform model architecture and multiple communication rounds, which
neglect resource heterogeneity, impose heavy computational demands on clients,
and increase communication overhead. To address these challenges, we propose
FedOL, to construct a larger and more comprehensive server model in one-shot
settings (i.e., in a single communication round). Instead of model parameter
sharing, FedOL employs knowledge distillation, where clients only exchange
model prediction outputs on an unlabeled public dataset. This reduces
communication overhead by transmitting compact predictions instead of full
model weights and enables model customization by allowing heterogeneous model
architectures. A key challenge in this setting is that client predictions may
be biased due to skewed local data distributions, and the lack of ground-truth
labels in the public dataset further complicates reliable learning. To mitigate
these issues, FedOL introduces a specialized objective function that
iteratively refines pseudo-labels and the server model, improving learning
reliability. To complement this, FedOL incorporates a tailored pseudo-label
generation and knowledge distillation strategy that effectively integrates
diverse knowledge. Simulation results show that FedOL significantly outperforms
existing baselines, offering a cost-effective solution for mobile networks
where clients possess valuable private data but limited computational
resources.

TL;DR: Introduces T2W, a diffusion-transformer framework that generates task-specific neural network weights from natural language descriptions. It uses hierarchical parameter blocks, CLIP-based prior attention, and adversarial weight-space augmentation, showing strong results on unseen tasks and enabling applications like weight enhancement and text-guided model fusion; code and a text-weight dataset are released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the gap in automatically generating neural networks that generalize to unseen tasks. While weight generation is promising, existing methods struggle with generalization and practical exploration; the work aims to bridge natural language semantics with weight-space dynamics.

Method: T2W is a diffusion-transformer model that generates neural network weights conditioned on text. It hierarchically processes parameters into uniform blocks, incorporates CLIP text embeddings through a prior attention mechanism, and employs adversarial training with weight-space augmentation to improve generalization.

Result: On CIFAR-100, Caltech256, and TinyImageNet, T2W produces high-quality weights for unseen tasks, outperforming optimization-based initialization, and enabling novel capabilities such as weight enhancement and text-guided model fusion. The authors also provide an open-source dataset of text-weight pairs.

Conclusion: The work advances neural parameter synthesis by linking textual semantics to weight-space dynamics, increasing the practicality of generative models for network parameter generation; code is released to support reproducibility.

Abstract: How far are we really from automatically generating neural networks? While
neural network weight generation shows promise, current approaches struggle
with generalization to unseen tasks and practical application exploration. To
address this, we propose T2W, a diffusion transformer framework that generates

hierarchically processes network parameters into uniform blocks, integrates
text embeddings from CLIP via a prior attention mechanism, and employs
adversarial training with weight-space augmentation to enhance generalization.
Experiments on Cifar100, Caltech256, and TinyImageNet demonstrate T2W's ability
to produce high-quality weights for unseen tasks, outperforming

### [125] [Explainable Learning Rate Regimes for Stochastic Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13639)
*Zhuang Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A automatic, parameter-free learning-rate (LR) schedule that adapts to stochastic gradient variation: increase when gradient norms shrink, decrease when they grow. It is explainable, uses stochastic second-order ideas, and works without tuning across SGD, SGDM, and SIGNSGD, improving efficiency and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LR tuning in SGD is costly and often relies on manual or multiple hyperparameters. The aim is an automatic, explainable LR regime driven solely by the intrinsic variation of stochastic gradients, reducing computational expense and tuning.

Method: Develops an explainable LR regime inspired by stochastic second-order algorithms that automatically updates LR without parameter tuning. The LR should increase as the norm of stochastic gradients decreases and decrease as it increases, enabling simple implementation and compatibility with SGD, SGDM, and SIGNSGD.

Result: Demonstrates efficiency, robustness, and scalability of the proposed LR regime across classical stochastic optimization algorithms on machine learning tasks.

Conclusion: An automatic, parameter-free LR regime guided by gradient variation; reduces tuning, computation, and hardware costs, while maintaining or improving performance across SGD variants.

Abstract: Modern machine learning is trained by stochastic gradient descent (SGD),
whose performance critically depends on how the learning rate (LR) is adjusted
and decreased over time. Yet existing LR regimes may be intricate, or need to
tune one or more additional hyper-parameters manually whose bottlenecks include
huge computational expenditure, time and power in practice. This work, in a
natural and direct manner, clarifies how LR should be updated automatically
only according to the intrinsic variation of stochastic gradients. An
explainable LR regime by leveraging stochastic second-order algorithms is
developed, behaving a similar pattern to heuristic algorithms but implemented
simply without any parameter tuning requirement, where it is of an automatic
procedure that LR should increase (decrease) as the norm of stochastic
gradients decreases (increases). The resulting LR regime shows its efficiency,
robustness, and scalability in different classical stochastic algorithms,
containing SGD, SGDM, and SIGNSGD, on machine learning tasks.

TL;DR: FedSheafHN uses a sheaf-based collaboration graph to unify client descriptors and a hypernetwork to generate personalized subgraph FL models, achieving better performance, faster convergence, and improved generalization for new clients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tackle performance variance in subgraph federated learning caused by heterogeneity of local subgraphs by enriching client representations and enabling efficient per-client models.

Method: Construct a collaboration graph by embedding each client's local subgraph into a server-generated graph using graph-level embeddings; apply sheaf diffusion on this graph to enrich client representations; employ a server-optimized hypernetwork to generate customized models for each client.

Result: Empirically outperforms existing personalized subgraph FL methods across multiple graph datasets, with faster convergence and better generalization to unseen clients.

Conclusion: The FedSheafHN framework effectively addresses heterogeneity in subgraph FL by coupling sheaf-based information diffusion with hypernetwork-driven personalization, yielding improved performance and generalization.

Abstract: Graph-structured data is prevalent in many applications. In subgraph
federated learning (FL), this data is distributed across clients, each with a
local subgraph. Personalized subgraph FL aims to develop a customized model for
each client to handle diverse data distributions. However, performance
variation across clients remains a key issue due to the heterogeneity of local
subgraphs. To overcome the challenge, we propose FedSheafHN, a novel framework
built on a sheaf collaboration mechanism to unify enhanced client descriptors
with efficient personalized model generation. Specifically, FedSheafHN embeds
each client's local subgraph into a server-constructed collaboration graph by
leveraging graph-level embeddings and employing sheaf diffusion within the
collaboration graph to enrich client representations. Subsequently, FedSheafHN
generates customized client models via a server-optimized hypernetwork.
Empirical evaluations demonstrate that FedSheafHN outperforms existing
personalized subgraph FL methods on various graph datasets. Additionally, it
exhibits fast model convergence and effectively generalizes to new clients.

*Ashish Jha,Anh huy Phan,Razan Dibo,Valentin Leplat*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GRAFT is a scalable in-training subset selection method that uses low-rank feature representations and a Fast MaxVol sampler to pick a small, diverse subset per batch, with dynamic subset size guided by gradient-approximation, preserving training dynamics while reducing time, energy, and emissions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training modern neural networks on large datasets is computationally and environmentally costly; reducing the data processed per update can cut wall-clock time and carbon footprint without sacrificing accuracy.

Method: For each batch, compute a low-rank feature representation; apply a Fast MaxVol sampler to select a small, diverse subset that spans the batch's dominant subspace; adapt the subset size dynamically using a gradient-approximation criterion to balance information and cost.

Result: GRAFT matches or surpasses recent selection baselines in accuracy and efficiency across benchmarks, while reducing wall-clock time, energy consumption, and CO2 emissions.

Conclusion: Operating in low-rank subspaces and training on carefully chosen examples preserves training trajectories and yields favorable accuracy–efficiency–emission trade-offs, making subset selection viable for scalable training.

Abstract: Training modern neural networks on large datasets is computationally and
environmentally costly. We introduce GRAFT, a scalable in-training subset
selection method that (i) extracts a low-rank feature representation for each
batch, (ii) applies a Fast MaxVol sampler to select a small, diverse subset
that spans the batch's dominant subspace, and (iii) dynamically adjusts the
subset size using a gradient-approximation criterion. By operating in low-rank
subspaces and training on carefully chosen examples instead of full batches,
GRAFT preserves the training trajectory while reducing wall-clock time, energy
consumption, and $\mathrm{CO}_2$ emissions. Across multiple benchmarks, GRAFT
matches or exceeds recent selection baselines in both accuracy and efficiency,

### [128] [Input Time Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13654)
*Rapheal Huang,Weilong Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Input Time Scaling: optimize query inputs during training and inference, showing training-testing co-design and counterintuitive data-effects; achieves SOTA among 32B models on AIME (high pass@1) with ensemble; questions standard data-quality dogma; notes open-sourcing datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate whether focusing resources on input queries (input-time) can unlock higher reasoning performance beyond conventional data and model scaling, and whether training and testing should be designed together (co-design).

Method: Introduce Input Time Scaling by refining inputs with LLM meta-knowledge using multiple query strategies during both training and testing. Conduct ablations and experiments on Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct; evaluate on AIME24/25; use ensemble majority voting to boost results; compare effects of data quality and dataset size on performance; explore open datasets and reproducibility.

Result: Achieves SOTA performance among 32B models on AIME24 and AIME25 (pass@1: 76.7% for both). With a majority vote of three models, AIME25 reaches 80%. Starting from DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B, best result: 86.7% on AIME24 and 76.7% on AIME25. Authors plan to open-source datasets, data pipelines, evaluation results, and checkpoints for reproducibility.

Conclusion: Input Time Scaling reveals training-testing co-design and challenges the assumption that higher data quality is always beneficial. Small or even noisy inputs can boost higher-level reasoning, and larger data quantity with similar quality may hurt. The approach complements data- and inference-scaling and can yield state-of-the-art results within 32B models; calls for rethinking data curation and promoting open resources.

Abstract: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) are usually post-trained on large-scale
carefully curated datasets (data & training scaling) and doing reasoning in
test time (inference time scaling). In this work, we present a new scaling
paradigm, Input Time Scaling, to complement previous scaling methods by putting
resources on queries (input time). During training and testing, we combine
meta-knowledge from LLMs to refine inputs with different strategies. We also
find a new phenomenon, training-testing co-design there. We need to apply query
strategies during both training and testing. Only applying strategies on
training or testing would seriously degrade the performance. We are also
surprised to find that seemingly low data quality datasets can gain high
performance. Adding irrelevant information to the queries, randomly selecting
examples from a minimally filtered dataset, can even perform the best. These
findings contradict the widely held inductive bias, "garbage in, garbage out".
Curating datasets with seemingly high-quality data can even potentially limit
the performance ceiling. In addition, models trained on more data with similar
quality (15k VS 1k) perform worse, simple dataset size scaling should also be
carefully inspected. The good news is that our findings are compatible with the
Less is More phenomenon. A small set of examples is enough to evoke high-level
reasoning ability. With experiments on models trained on Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct,
we are able to reach SOTA performance among 32B models on AIME24(76.7%) and
AIME25(76.7%) pass@1. We can further achieve AIME24(76.7%) and AIME25(80%) with
a majority vote of three models. Starting from DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B,
the best result would be 86.7% on AIME24 and 76.7% on AIME25. To facilitate
reproducibility and further research, we are working on open-source our
datasets, data pipelines, evaluation results, and checkpoints.

### [129] [In-Context Decision Making for Optimizing Complex AutoML Pipelines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13657)
*Amir Rezaei Balef,Katharina Eggensperger*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Extends CASH to handle modern ML pipelines by learning to select and adapt pipelines with PS-PFN, a posterior-sampling-based approach using PFNs to model the maximum value across arms; includes cost-aware and per-arm PFN modeling, with solid empirical gains and code release.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As ML workflows increasingly involve fine-tuning, ensembling, and adaptation of pretrained models, the traditional CASH problem must be extended to select and adapt heterogeneous pipelines, not just hyperparameters.

Method: Proposes PS-PFN, extending Posterior Sampling to the max k-armed bandit, using prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) to estimate the posterior of the maximum reward via in-context learning. The framework supports varying pull costs and allows different PFNs per arm to model their reward distributions.

Result: Empirical results on one novel task and two standard benchmarks show PS-PFN achieving superior performance compared to other bandit and AutoML strategies.

Conclusion: PS-PFN is effective for selecting and adapting modern ML pipelines and can accommodate cost-aware considerations and arm-specific reward modeling; code and data are released for reproducibility.

Abstract: Combined Algorithm Selection and Hyperparameter Optimization (CASH) has been
fundamental to traditional AutoML systems. However, with the advancements of
pre-trained models, modern ML workflows go beyond hyperparameter optimization
and often require fine-tuning, ensembling, and other adaptation techniques.
While the core challenge of identifying the best-performing model for a
downstream task remains, the increasing heterogeneity of ML pipelines demands
novel AutoML approaches. This work extends the CASH framework to select and
adapt modern ML pipelines. We propose PS-PFN to efficiently explore and exploit
adapting ML pipelines by extending Posterior Sampling (PS) to the max k-armed
bandit problem setup. PS-PFN leverages prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) to
efficiently estimate the posterior distribution of the maximal value via
in-context learning. We show how to extend this method to consider varying
costs of pulling arms and to use different PFNs to model reward distributions
individually per arm. Experimental results on one novel and two existing
standard benchmark tasks demonstrate the superior performance of PS-PFN
compared to other bandit and AutoML strategies. We make our code and data
available at https://github.com/amirbalef/CASHPlus.

*Maciej Wojtala,Bogusz Stefańczyk,Dominik Bogucki,Łukasz Lepak,Jakub Strykowski,Paweł Wawrzyński*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A differentiable, self-attention-based communication module for multi-agent reinforcement learning that enables reward-driven message exchange, with a fixed parameter count independent of the number of agents, integrable with any value-decomposition method, achieving state-of-the-art on SMAC maps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome non-differentiable and complex communication protocols in MARL and to enable scalable, differentiable, reward-driven message exchange among agents.

Method: Proposes a self-attention-based communication module that is fully differentiable and can be attached to any action-value function decomposition method. The module allows agents to generate messages in a reward-driven manner and has a fixed number of trainable parameters, independent of the number of agents, effectively extending standard value-decomposition approaches.

Result: Empirical evaluation on the SMAC benchmark shows the method achieves state-of-the-art performance on several maps, demonstrating strong effectiveness.

Conclusion: The approach provides a scalable, differentiable communication mechanism for MARL that can be integrated with existing decomposition-based methods and improves performance on realistic multi-agent tasks.

Abstract: Communication is essential for the collective execution of complex tasks by
human agents, motivating interest in communication mechanisms for multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL). However, existing communication protocols in
MARL are often complex and non-differentiable. In this work, we introduce a
self-attention-based communication module that exchanges information between
the agents in MARL. Our proposed approach is fully differentiable, allowing
agents to learn to generate messages in a reward-driven manner. The module can
be seamlessly integrated with any action-value function decomposition method
and can be viewed as an extension of such decompositions. Notably, it includes
a fixed number of trainable parameters, independent of the number of agents.
Experimental results on the SMAC benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on several maps.

### [131] [Heavy-tailed Linear Bandits: Adversarial Robustness, Best-of-both-worlds, and Beyond](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13679)
*Canzhe Zhao,Shinji Ito,Shuai Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a general FTRL-based framework with bonus-shifted loss estimates to achieve best-of-both-worlds (BOBW) guarantees for adversarial heavy-tailed bandits, including finite-arm MABs and linear bandits, and introduces HT-SPM for data-dependent learning rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To fill the gap where heavy-tailed bandits have been largely studied in stochastic settings; extend robust learning to adversarial regimes and to linear bandits, removing restrictive truncation assumptions.

Method: Develop a follow-the-regularized-leader (FTRL) algorithm with loss estimates shifted by a carefully designed bonus; design a bonus structure to obtain BOBW; extend to heavy-tailed linear bandits with variance-reduced loss estimators; introduce HT-SPM (heavy-tailed noise aware stability-penalty matching) as a data-dependent learning-rate framework that guarantees BOBW under certain conditions.

Result: BOBW regret for heavy-tailed MABs: tilde-O(T^{1/ε}) in worst case; tilde-O(log T) gap-dependent in stochastic regime. For finite-arm linear bandits: tilde-O(d^{1/2} T^{1/ε}) regret, matching stochastic bounds. HT-SPM ensures BOBW for general heavy-tailed problems; with variance-reduced estimators, first BOBW result for heavy-tailed linear bandits.

Conclusion: This work provides the first BOBW results for adversarial heavy-tailed bandits in both MAB and linear settings, via a unifying FTRL framework and a data-dependent learning rate; sets groundwork for further improvements and practical variance-reduction techniques.

Abstract: Heavy-tailed bandits have been extensively studied since the seminal work of
\citet{Bubeck2012BanditsWH}. In particular, heavy-tailed linear bandits,
enabling efficient learning with both a large number of arms and heavy-tailed
noises, have recently attracted significant attention
\citep{ShaoYKL18,XueWWZ20,ZhongHYW21,Wang2025heavy,tajdini2025improved}.
However, prior studies focus almost exclusively on stochastic regimes, with few
exceptions limited to the special case of heavy-tailed multi-armed bandits
(MABs) \citep{Huang0H22,ChengZ024,Chen2024uniINF}.
  In this work, we propose a general framework for adversarial heavy-tailed
bandit problems, which performs follow-the-regularized-leader (FTRL) over the
loss estimates shifted by a bonus function. Via a delicate setup of the bonus
function, we devise the first FTRL-type best-of-both-worlds (BOBW) algorithm
for heavy-tailed MABs, which does not require the truncated non-negativity
assumption and achieves an $\widetilde{O}(T^{\frac{1}{\varepsilon}})$
worst-case regret in the adversarial regime as well as an $\widetilde{O}(\log
T)$ gap-dependent regret in the stochastic regime. We then extend our framework
to the linear case, proposing the first algorithm for adversarial heavy-tailed
linear bandits with finite arm sets. This algorithm achieves an
$\widetilde{O}(d^{\frac{1}{2}}T^{\frac{1}{\varepsilon}})$ regret, matching the
best-known worst-case regret bound in stochastic regimes. Moreover, we propose
a general data-dependent learning rate, termed \textit{heavy-tailed noise aware
stability-penalty matching} (HT-SPM). We prove that HT-SPM guarantees BOBW
regret bounds for general heavy-tailed bandit problems once certain conditions
are satisfied. By using HT-SPM and, in particular, a variance-reduced linear
loss estimator, we obtain the first BOBW result for heavy-tailed linear
bandits.

*Nikolai Antonov,Prěmysl Šůcha,Mikoláš Janota,Jan Hůla*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A data-driven heuristic for single-machine scheduling minimizes total weighted tardiness with due-date and deadline constraints, by integrating machine learning with problem-specific structure to ensure feasibility and outperform existing methods on gap, optimal solutions, and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of pure exact algorithms (which can degrade on challenging regions) and ML-only approaches (which may fail to guarantee feasibility); aim for scalable, dataset-tailored, and feasible solutions across diverse instances.

Method: Introduce a novel ML-assisted scheduling heuristic that blends machine learning with problem-specific scheduling characteristics, with explicit mechanisms to guarantee feasible solutions; perform systematic exploration and selection of ML models to justify the chosen model.

Result: The approach significantly improves optimality gap, increases the number of optimal solutions, and shows strong adaptability across varied data scenarios compared to state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: Data-driven, problem-aware scheduling can substantially outperform traditional methods for single-machine scheduling with weight, duration, due date, and deadline, with careful model selection and built-in feasibility guarantees.

Abstract: Existing research on single-machine scheduling is largely focused on exact
algorithms, which perform well on typical instances but can significantly
deteriorate on certain regions of the problem space. In contrast, data-driven
approaches provide strong and scalable performance when tailored to the
structure of specific datasets. Leveraging this idea, we focus on a
single-machine scheduling problem where each job is defined by its weight,
duration, due date, and deadline, aiming to minimize the total weight of tardy
jobs. We introduce a novel data-driven scheduling heuristic that combines
machine learning with problem-specific characteristics, ensuring feasible
solutions, which is a common challenge for ML-based algorithms. Experimental
results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms the
state-of-the-art in terms of optimality gap, number of optimal solutions, and
adaptability across varied data scenarios, highlighting its flexibility for
practical applications. In addition, we conduct a systematic exploration of ML
models, addressing a common gap in similar studies by offering a detailed model
selection process and providing insights into why the chosen model is the best
fit.

*Jie Shi,Arno P. J. M. Siebes,Siamak Mehrkanoon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A privacy-preserving federated learning framework (Trans-XFed) for supply chain credit assessment that combines FedProx with a transformer encoder and integrated gradients for interpretability, plus a performance-based client selection strategy (PBCS) to address class imbalance and Non-IID data, achieving faster convergence and competitive accuracy with transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy, information silos, class imbalance, Non-IID data, and the need for model interpretability in supply chain credit risk assessment.

Method: Proposes Trans-XFed architecture that uses FedProx with homomorphic encryption as the core model, augmented by a transformer encoder. Introduces a performance-based client selection strategy (PBCS) that selects high-F1-score clients to tackle class imbalance and Non-IID issues. Uses integrated gradients for explainability.

Result: Experimentally shown to deliver accurate credit assessments against baselines while preserving privacy and providing interpretability through transformer features and integrated gradients.

Conclusion: Trans-XFed effectively addresses privacy, Non-IID, class imbalance, and interpretability in supply chain credit risk via a hybrid FL framework with PBCS, HE-enabled FedProx, and XAI components, achieving strong performance and transparency.

Abstract: This paper proposes a Trans-XFed architecture that combines federated
learning with explainable AI techniques for supply chain credit assessment. The
proposed model aims to address several key challenges, including privacy,
information silos, class imbalance, non-identically and independently
distributed (Non-IID) data, and model interpretability in supply chain credit
assessment. We introduce a performance-based client selection strategy (PBCS)
to tackle class imbalance and Non-IID problems. This strategy achieves faster
convergence by selecting clients with higher local F1 scores. The FedProx
architecture, enhanced with homomorphic encryption, is used as the core model,
and further incorporates a transformer encoder. The transformer encoder block
provides insights into the learned features. Additionally, we employ the
integrated gradient explainable AI technique to offer insights into
decision-making. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Trans-XFed through
experimental evaluations on real-world supply chain datasets. The obtained
results show its ability to deliver accurate credit assessments compared to
several baselines, while maintaining transparency and privacy.

### [134] [DREAMS: Preserving both Local and Global Structure in Dimensionality Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13747)
*Noël Kury,Dmitry Kobak,Sebastian Damrich*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DREAMS provides a tunable embedding that blends local structure (t-SNE) with global structure (PCA) to reveal multi-scale data structure in 2D, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many dimensionality reduction methods excel at preserving either local or global structure, but not both; a method that balances both scales would yield more faithful visualizations for data with multi-scale organization, such as single-cell transcriptomics and population genetics.

Method: Introduce DREAMS (Dimensionality Reduction Enhanced Across Multiple Scales), which adds a simple regularization term to interpolate between t-SNE and PCA. The method generates a spectrum of embeddings that progressively trade local fidelity for global fidelity, enabling efficient exploration across multiple scales.

Result: Benchmarking on seven real-world datasets (five single-cell transcriptomics, one population genetics) shows DREAMS qualitatively and quantitatively preserves structure across scales more effectively than prior approaches.

Conclusion: DREAMS offers a flexible, scalable framework for multi-scale visualization that integrates local and global structure preservation, with practical benefits across diverse real-world datasets.

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction techniques are widely used for visualizing
high-dimensional data in two dimensions. Existing methods are typically
designed to preserve either local (e.g. $t$-SNE, UMAP) or global (e.g. MDS,
PCA) structure of the data, but none of the established methods can represent
both aspects well. In this paper, we present DREAMS (Dimensionality Reduction
Enhanced Across Multiple Scales), a method that combines the local structure
preservation of $t$-SNE with the global structure preservation of PCA via a
simple regularization term. Our approach generates a spectrum of embeddings
between the locally well-structured $t$-SNE embedding and the globally
well-structured PCA embedding, efficiently balancing both local and global
structure preservation. We benchmark DREAMS across seven real-world datasets,
including five from single-cell transcriptomics and one from population
genetics, showcasing qualitatively and quantitatively its superior ability to
preserve structure across multiple scales compared to previous approaches.

### [135] [Order Optimal Regret Bounds for Sharpe Ratio Optimization in the Bandit Setting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13749)
*Mohammad Taha Shah,Sabrina Khurshid,Gourab Ghatak*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Thompson Sampling for Sharpe ratio optimization in Gaussian-bandit setting yields logarithmic regret with a Sharpe-specific information-theoretic analysis; introduces SRTS with upper/lower bounds showing order-optimality; empirically superior to baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sharpe ratio combines return and risk, requiring exploration of both mean and variance. Standard bandit objectives focus on cumulative reward and may overlook risk-adjusted performance; a principled, uncertainty-aware approach is needed for risk-aware sequential decision making.

Method: Propose SRTS, a Thompson Sampling-based algorithm tailored for Sharpe ratio under Gaussian rewards with unknown mean and variance. Develop a Sharpe-specific regret decomposition to capture information acquisition about the entire reward distribution. Derive an upper regret bound for SRTS and a matching lower bound, establishing logarithmic, distribution-dependent regret. Validate via empirical simulations against existing algorithms.

Result: SRTS achieves logarithmic regret with distribution-dependent constants; the new decomposition clarifies how information about the distribution affects learning efficiency; empirical results show superior performance over baselines.

Conclusion: Thompson Sampling can be effectively adapted to risk-adjusted objectives like the Sharpe ratio. The work provides order-optimal regret guarantees and a principled information-theoretic perspective for risk-aware exploration in Gaussian-bandit settings, with strong empirical support.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of sequential decision-making for
Sharpe ratio (SR) maximization in a stochastic bandit setting. We focus on the
Thompson Sampling (TS) algorithm, a Bayesian approach celebrated for its
empirical performance and exploration efficiency, under the assumption of
Gaussian rewards with unknown parameters. Unlike conventional bandit objectives
focusing on maximizing cumulative reward, Sharpe ratio optimization instead
introduces an inherent tradeoff between achieving high returns and controlling
risk, demanding careful exploration of both mean and variance. Our theoretical
contributions include a novel regret decomposition specifically designed for
the Sharpe ratio, highlighting the role of information acquisition about the
reward distribution in driving learning efficiency. Then, we establish
fundamental performance limits for the proposed algorithm \texttt{SRTS} in
terms of an upper bound on regret. We also derive the matching lower bound and
show the order-optimality. Our results show that Thompson Sampling achieves
logarithmic regret over time, with distribution-dependent factors capturing the
difficulty of distinguishing arms based on risk-adjusted performance. Empirical
simulations show that our algorithm significantly outperforms existing
algorithms.

### [136] [Depth-Breadth Synergy in RLVR: Unlocking LLM Reasoning Gains with Adaptive Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13755)
*Zhicheng Yang,Zhijiang Guo,Yinya Huang,Yongxin Wang,Dongchun Xie,Yiwei Wang,Xiaodan Liang,Jing Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RLVR's effectiveness is limited by depth (problem hardness) and breadth (training instances). The common GRPO bias over-weights medium-accuracy samples and under-weights hard instances. Introducing Difficulty Adaptive Rollout Sampling (DARS) reweights hard problems via multi-stage rollouts, improving convergence and Pass@K without extra inference cost. Scaling breadth with full-batch updates over epochs further boosts Pass@1 and Pass@K, and combining with DARS (DARS-B) yields gains in both metrics. Breadth and depth exploration are orthogonal dimensions in RLVR, critical for unlocking reasoning in LMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome biases in RLVR that favor medium-accuracy samples and under-exploit hard problems, and to investigate how both depth (problem difficulty) and breadth (batch size) influence reasoning ability and efficiency.

Method: Propose Difficulty Adaptive Rollout Sampling (DARS) that reweights hard problems through targeted multi-stage rollouts. Empirically analyze rollout size effects and compare naive enlargement of rollouts versus adaptive sampling. Replace PPO mini-batches with full-batch updates over multiple epochs to study large-breadth training. Develop DARS-B by combining DARS with large-breadth training and evaluate on Pass@K and Pass@1 metrics, and monitor token-level entropy as a proxy for exploration.

Result: DARS increases the number of positive rollouts for hard problems and yields consistent Pass@K gains without extra inference cost. Simply enlarging rollout size accelerates convergence but hurts Pass@K. Large-breadth training significantly improves Pass@1 and maintains high token-level entropy. DARS-B achieves simultaneous gains in Pass@K and Pass@1, validating the orthogonal benefit of breadth and adaptive depth exploration in RLVR.

Conclusion: Breadth (training data scale) and adaptive depth exploration (DARS) are orthogonal, complementary dimensions that unlock stronger reasoning in RLVR. Integrating adaptive rollout strategies with large-breadth training yields the largest gains in both top-K and first-pass performance.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) has emerged as a
powerful paradigm for unlocking reasoning capabilities in large language
models, yet its full potential is hindered by two under-explored dimensions:
Depth-the hardest problem a model can sample; Breadth-the number of instances
consumed in a single iteration. We dissect the popular GRPO algorithm and
reveal a systematic bias: the cumulative-advantage disproportionately weights
samples with medium accuracy, while down-weighting the low-accuracy instances
that are crucial for pushing reasoning boundaries. To rectify the depth
neglect, we introduce Difficulty Adaptive Rollout Sampling (DARS), which
re-weights hard problems through targeted multi-stage rollouts, thereby
increasing the number of positive rollouts for hard problems. Empirically,
naively enlarging rollout size only accelerates convergence and even hurts
Pass@K. Our DARS, in contrast, delivers consistent Pass@K gains without extra
inference cost at convergence. Just as we adaptively expanded the depth of
exploration, we now ask whether aggressively scaling the breadth of training
data can further amplify reasoning gains. To this end, we intensely scale batch
size and replace PPO's mini-batch iterations with full-batch updates over
multiple epochs. Increasing breadth significantly enhances Pass@1 performance.
Large-breadth training sustains high token-level entropy, indicating continued
exploration and reduced gradient noise. We further present DARS-B, which
augments DARS with large breadth, and demonstrate simultaneous gains in Pass@K
and Pass@1. The results confirm that breadth and adaptive exploration across
depth operate as orthogonal dimensions in RLVR, which are key to unleashing the
reasoning power of RLVR.

*Tian Sun,Yuqi Chen,Weiwei Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PENGUIN introduces Periodic-Nested Group Attention for long-term time series forecasting, leveraging periodic-nested relative attention bias and grouped multi-query attention to model multiple periodicities, achieving state-of-the-art performance over MLP and Transformer baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite Transformer gains in forecasting, self-attention effectiveness for time series is debated; there is a need to explicitly model periodic patterns and multiple periodicities to improve long-term forecasting.

Method: Periodic-nested relative attention bias to capture periodic structures; grouped attention with one group per periodicity using a multi-query attention mechanism; a simple yet effective transformer-like mechanism named PENGUIN.

Result: Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks show that PENGUIN consistently outperforms both MLP-based and Transformer-based models.

Conclusion: Explicit modeling of periodic patterns is crucial for long-term time series forecasting; PENGUIN provides a simple, effective approach that yields consistent gains across datasets.

Abstract: Long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) is a fundamental task with
wide-ranging applications. Although Transformer-based models have made
significant breakthroughs in forecasting, their effectiveness for time series
forecasting remains debatable. In this paper, we revisit the significance of
self-attention and propose a simple yet effective mechanism, Periodic-Nested
Group Attention, namely PENGUIN. Our approach highlights the importance of
explicitly modeling periodic patterns and incorporating relative attention bias
for effective time series modeling. To this end, we introduce a periodic-nested
relative attention bias that captures periodic structures directly. To handle
multiple coexisting periodicities (e.g., daily and weekly cycles), we design a
grouped attention mechanism, where each group targets a specific periodicity
using a multi-query attention mechanism. Extensive experiments across diverse
benchmarks demonstrate that PENGUIN consistently outperforms both MLP-based and
Transformer-based models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adaptive participant selection (ISP) in federated learning dynamically determines the optimal number of clients per round to boost communication efficiency without sacrificing accuracy, achieving up to 30% communication savings across domains (vision transformers, ECG classification) and with gradient compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated learning suffers from communication bottlenecks due to heterogeneous and dynamic client participation; the problem of selecting the number of participating clients per round is underexplored and warrants an adaptive solution.

Method: Introduce Intelligent Selection of Participants (ISP), an adaptive mechanism that determines the optimal number of clients per round. ISP is evaluated across diverse setups including vision transformers, real-world ECG classification, and training with gradient compression.

Result: ISP yields consistent communication savings of up to 30% without loss of final model quality; results emphasize that choosing the number of clients is a distinct task in federated learning and can be optimized.

Conclusion: ISP provides a practical and domain-agnostic approach to improve FL communication efficiency by adaptively selecting the number of participating clients, with demonstrated effectiveness across vision transformers and ECG tasks and in conjunction with gradient compression.

Abstract: Rapid scaling of deep learning models has enabled performance gains across
domains, yet it introduced several challenges. Federated Learning (FL) has
emerged as a promising framework to address these concerns by enabling
decentralized training. Nevertheless, communication efficiency remains a key
bottleneck in FL, particularly under heterogeneous and dynamic client
participation. Existing methods, such as FedAvg and FedProx, or other
approaches, including client selection strategies, attempt to mitigate
communication costs. However, the problem of choosing the number of clients in
a training round remains extremely underexplored. We introduce Intelligent
Selection of Participants (ISP), an adaptive mechanism that dynamically
determines the optimal number of clients per round to enhance communication
efficiency without compromising model accuracy. We validate the effectiveness
of ISP across diverse setups, including vision transformers, real-world ECG
classification, and training with gradient compression. Our results show
consistent communication savings of up to 30\% without losing the final
quality. Applying ISP to different real-world ECG classification setups
highlighted the selection of the number of clients as a separate task of
federated learning.

Conclusion: The work provides a proof-of-concept showing that IN-RL with SLA and INT can enable dynamic, data-driven path selection in programmable networks; indicates potential for scalable, low-latency routing decisions while highlighting areas for real-world deployment and robustness evaluation.

Abstract: This work presents a proof-of-concept implementation of a distributed,

our SLA-based mechanism converges to effective path selections and adapts to
shifting network conditions at line rate.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A formal Subjective Logic-based framework to assess dataset-level trustworthiness (e.g., bias) with uncertainty handling, evaluated on a traffic sign dataset, capturing class imbalance and robust in centralized and federated settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dataset-level trustworthiness is crucial for AI training, especially for properties like bias that emerge only from the data distribution. Prior work focused on data-item trust; there is a need for uncertainty-aware evaluation of global dataset properties.

Method: Introduce a formal framework built on Subjective Logic that supports trust propositions and quantifies epistemic and evidence uncertainty when evidence is incomplete, distributed, or conflicting. Instantiate the framework to the trustworthiness property of bias, and empirically evaluate on a traffic sign recognition dataset, examining class imbalance and performance in centralized and federated contexts.

Result: The approach captures class imbalance and yields interpretable results; it remains robust and applicable in both centralized and federated settings, demonstrating practical effectiveness in assessing dataset bias with uncertainty.

Conclusion: This work provides a principled, uncertainty-aware method for assessing dataset-level trustworthiness (bias) using Subjective Logic, enabling reliable evaluation even with incomplete or conflicting evidence and across data collection contexts.

Abstract: As AI systems increasingly rely on training data, assessing dataset
trustworthiness has become critical, particularly for properties like fairness
or bias that emerge at the dataset level. Prior work has used Subjective Logic
to assess trustworthiness of individual data, but not to evaluate
trustworthiness properties that emerge only at the level of the dataset as a
whole. This paper introduces the first formal framework for assessing the
trustworthiness of AI training datasets, enabling uncertainty-aware evaluations
of global properties such as bias. Built on Subjective Logic, our approach
supports trust propositions and quantifies uncertainty in scenarios where
evidence is incomplete, distributed, and/or conflicting. We instantiate this
framework on the trustworthiness property of bias, and we experimentally
evaluate it based on a traffic sign recognition dataset. The results
demonstrate that our method captures class imbalance and remains interpretable
and robust in both centralized and federated contexts.

### [141] [Disentangled Deep Smoothed Bootstrap for Fair Imbalanced Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13829)
*Samuel Stocksieker,Denys pommeret,Arthur Charpentier*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A latent-space data augmentation method for Imbalanced Regression (IR) using a disentangled VAE and a latent-space smoothed bootstrap to improve performance on tabular data; evaluated against competitors on IR benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Imbalanced distributions in regression degrade predictive performance. Most IR work targets classification; there is a need for effective IR techniques for tabular regression data.

Method: Model the data with Variational Autoencoders to capture latent distributions. To address imbalance, introduce a disentangled VAE coupled with a Smoothed Bootstrap in the latent space to generate synthetic samples and balance the training data. Evaluate performance against existing IR methods on benchmark datasets.

Result: Numerical experiments show the proposed approach is competitive and improves performance relative to baselines on IR benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Latent-space generation via a disentangled VAE and latent-space smoothed bootstrap offers a viable and effective strategy for imbalanced regression on tabular data, expanding IR methods beyond traditional classification-focused approaches.

Abstract: Imbalanced distribution learning is a common and significant challenge in
predictive modeling, often reducing the performance of standard algorithms.
Although various approaches address this issue, most are tailored to
classification problems, with a limited focus on regression. This paper
introduces a novel method to improve learning on tabular data within the
Imbalanced Regression (IR) framework, which is a critical problem. We propose
using Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to model and define a latent
representation of data distributions. However, VAEs can be inefficient with
imbalanced data like other standard approaches. To address this, we develop an
innovative data generation method that combines a disentangled VAE with a
Smoothed Bootstrap applied in the latent space. We evaluate the efficiency of
this method through numerical comparisons with competitors on benchmark
datasets for IR.

### [142] [One Shot vs. Iterative: Rethinking Pruning Strategies for Model Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13836)
*Mikołaj Janusz,Tomasz Wojnar,Yawei Li,Luca Benini,Kamil Adamczewski*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Systematic comparison of one-shot vs iterative pruning across structured and unstructured settings reveals trade-offs by pruning ratio; one-shot is better at low pruning levels, iterative at high pruning; introduces patience-based pruning and a hybrid approach; code available for reproducibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the prevailing bias toward iterative pruning as the default and provide rigorous, benchmarked guidance for practitioners on when to use one-shot vs iterative pruning and how to combine strategies.

Method: Define rigorous, formal comparisons of pruning strategies; benchmark across structured and unstructured pruning, multiple pruning criteria, and modalities; evaluate across pruning ratios; analyze trade-offs and propose a hybrid, patience-based approach.

Result: One-shot pruning outperforms iterative pruning at low pruning ratios; iterative pruning performs better at high pruning ratios; a patience-based pruning strategy and a hybrid method can outperform traditional methods in some scenarios.

Conclusion: Pruning strategy should be chosen based on goals and constraints; adopt patience-based pruning and consider hybrid approaches to improve performance; source code provided for reproducibility.

Abstract: Pruning is a core technique for compressing neural networks to improve
computational efficiency. This process is typically approached in two ways:
one-shot pruning, which involves a single pass of training and pruning, and
iterative pruning, where pruning is performed over multiple cycles for
potentially finer network refinement. Although iterative pruning has
historically seen broader adoption, this preference is often assumed rather
than rigorously tested. Our study presents one of the first systematic and
comprehensive comparisons of these methods, providing rigorous definitions,
benchmarking both across structured and unstructured settings, and applying
different pruning criteria and modalities. We find that each method has
specific advantages: one-shot pruning proves more effective at lower pruning
ratios, while iterative pruning performs better at higher ratios. Building on
these findings, we advocate for patience-based pruning and introduce a hybrid
approach that can outperform traditional methods in certain scenarios,
providing valuable insights for practitioners selecting a pruning strategy
tailored to their goals and constraints. Source code is available at

### [143] [FedUP: Efficient Pruning-based Federated Unlearning for Model Poisoning Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13853)
*Nicolò Romandini,Cristian Borcea,Rebecca Montanari,Luca Foschini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedUP introduces a lightweight federated unlearning approach that prunes high-magnitude, divergent weights to suppress malicious influence using only the last training round, effective against colluding attackers, and faster and storage-efficient than state-of-the-art.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated Learning is vulnerable to model poisoning attacks. Federated Unlearning (FU) aims to remove the influence of malicious contributors without full retraining, but existing FU methods often assume trusted clients. This work tackles FU under malicious and potentially colluding participants and aims for efficient, data-light unlearning.

Method: FedUP prunes specific connections in the attacked model by zeroing the highest-magnitude weights that diverge most between the latest updates from benign and malicious clients, using only the last-round weights to identify targets. This isolates malicious influence while preserving benign information, even in scenarios with colluding attackers. It is evaluated under a strong threat model (up to ~50% malicious clients) across IID/Non-IID data with label-flipping and backdoor attacks, against SOTA FU methods.

Result: FedUP reduces malicious influence so that accuracy on data associated with malicious updates matches a model retrained from scratch, while preserving benign-data performance. It is faster and saves storage compared to SOTA FU methods.

Conclusion: FedUP provides effective, efficient federated unlearning in the presence of malicious and colluding clients, achieving unlearning without full retraining and offering practical gains in speed and storage.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) can be vulnerable to attacks, such as model
poisoning, where adversaries send malicious local weights to compromise the
global model. Federated Unlearning (FU) is emerging as a solution to address
such vulnerabilities by selectively removing the influence of detected
malicious contributors on the global model without complete retraining.
However, unlike typical FU scenarios where clients are trusted and cooperative,
applying FU with malicious and possibly colluding clients is challenging
because their collaboration in unlearning their data cannot be assumed. This
work presents FedUP, a lightweight FU algorithm designed to efficiently
mitigate malicious clients' influence by pruning specific connections within
the attacked model. Our approach achieves efficiency by relying only on
clients' weights from the last training round before unlearning to identify
which connections to inhibit. Isolating malicious influence is non-trivial due
to overlapping updates from benign and malicious clients. FedUP addresses this
by carefully selecting and zeroing the highest magnitude weights that diverge
the most between the latest updates from benign and malicious clients while
preserving benign information. FedUP is evaluated under a strong adversarial
threat model, where up to 50%-1 of the clients could be malicious and have full
knowledge of the aggregation process. We demonstrate the effectiveness,
robustness, and efficiency of our solution through experiments across IID and
Non-IID data, under label-flipping and backdoor attacks, and by comparing it
with state-of-the-art (SOTA) FU solutions. In all scenarios, FedUP reduces
malicious influence, lowering accuracy on malicious data to match that of a
model retrained from scratch while preserving performance on benign data. FedUP
achieves effective unlearning while consistently being faster and saving
storage compared to the SOTA.

### [144] [A Comprehensive Re-Evaluation of Biometric Modality Properties in the Modern Era](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13874)
*Rouqaiah Al-Refai,Pankaja Priya Ramasamy,Ragini Ramesh,Patricia Arias-Cabarcos,Philipp Terhörst*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An expert-survey-based update to biometric evaluation, shifting modality property ratings and aligning with empirical data, aiming to replace outdated 1998 framework; identifies open challenges from disagreements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for a current, comprehensive framework to evaluate biometric modalities for real-world applications amid new attacks and tech advances; current 1998 table is outdated.

Method: Survey of 24 biometric specialists assessing multiple properties across modalities; analysis of agreement levels; comparison with dataset-level uncertainty across 55 biometric datasets.

Result: Face ratings improve; fingerprint reliability declines due to vulnerabilities; overall substantial shifts in property ratings; high expert agreement; strong alignment with dataset uncertainty for most modalities; disagreements highlight open challenges.

Conclusion: Expert assessments should be integrated with empirical evidence to guide future research; update and extend evaluation frameworks beyond the 1998 table; address open challenges where experts disagree.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of authentication systems and their increasing reliance
on biometrics for faster and more accurate user verification experience,
highlight the critical need for a reliable framework to evaluate the
suitability of biometric modalities for specific applications. Currently, the
most widely known evaluation framework is a comparative table from 1998, which
no longer adequately captures recent technological developments or emerging
vulnerabilities in biometric systems. To address these challenges, this work
revisits the evaluation of biometric modalities through an expert survey
involving 24 biometric specialists. The findings indicate substantial shifts in
property ratings across modalities. For example, face recognition, shows
improved ratings due to technological progress, while fingerprint, shows
decreased reliability because of emerging vulnerabilities and attacks. Further
analysis of expert agreement levels across rated properties highlighted the
consistency of the provided evaluations and ensured the reliability of the
ratings. Finally, expert assessments are compared with dataset-level
uncertainty across 55 biometric datasets, revealing strong alignment in most
modalities and underscoring the importance of integrating empirical evidence
with expert insight. Moreover, the identified expert disagreements reveal key
open challenges and help guide future research toward resolving them.

### [145] [Fisher-Orthogonal Projection Methods for Natural Gradient Descent with Large Batches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13898)
*Yishun Lu,Wesley Armour*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fisher-Orthogonal Projection (FOP) makes second-order optimization viable at very large batch sizes by constructing a variance-aware update from two sub-batches, introducing a Fisher-orthogonal gradient component that preserves curvature information for faster convergence and better generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large batch sizes reduce gradient noise, causing first-order methods to struggle to escape sharp minima, while second-order methods like KFAC require high damping at scale, which washes out curvature benefits. There is a need to preserve curvature information while scaling to big batches.

Method: FOP builds a variance-aware update direction by using gradients from two sub-batches. It augments the average gradient with a component of the gradient difference that is orthogonal to the average under the Fisher metric, creating a Fisher-orthogonal projection to recover second-order advantages at large batch sizes.

Result: The method enables scalable training with improved generalization and faster convergence by reintroducing effective curvature information into the update at very large batch sizes.

Conclusion: FOP provides a practical approach to scaling second-order optimization to very large batches, preserving curvature advantages and improving training dynamics across large-batch regimes.

Abstract: Modern GPUs are equipped with large amounts of high-bandwidth memory,
enabling them to support mini-batch sizes of up to tens of thousands of
training samples. However, most existing optimizers struggle to perform
effectively at such a large batch size. As batch size increases, gradient noise
decreases due to averaging over many samples, limiting the ability of
first-order methods to escape sharp or suboptimal minima and reach the global
minimum. Meanwhile, second-order methods like the natural gradient with
Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (KFAC) often require excessively high
damping to remain stable at large batch sizes. This high damping effectively
washes out the curvature information that gives these methods their advantage,
reducing their performance to that of simple gradient descent. In this paper,
we introduce Fisher-Orthogonal Projection (FOP), a novel technique that
restores the effectiveness of the second-order method at very large batch
sizes, enabling scalable training with improved generalization and faster
convergence. FOP constructs a variance-aware update direction by leveraging
gradients from two sub-batches, enhancing the average gradient with a component
of the gradient difference that is orthogonal to the average under the
Fisher-metric.

### [146] [Revisiting Diffusion Q-Learning: From Iterative Denoising to One-Step Action Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13904)
*Thanh Nguyen,Chang D. Yoo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OFQL enables fast one-step action generation for diffusion-based offline RL by reframing DQL in Flow Matching with an average velocity field; achieves better performance than DQL and diffusion-based baselines on D4RL while reducing training/inference time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DQL is strong but relies on multi-step denoising for action generation, which is slow and resource-intensive. A reliable one-step generation method is highly desirable, but naive one-step approaches degrade performance.

Method: Reformulate DQL within the sample-efficient Flow Matching framework and replace conventional curved generative trajectories with an average velocity field to permit direct, accurate one-step action generation. This avoids auxiliary models, distillation, multi-phase training, and recursive gradient updates.

Result: OFQL outperforms DQL and other diffusion-based baselines on the D4RL benchmark and substantially reduces training and inference time due to one-step generation.

Conclusion: OFQL provides a faster, more robust diffusion-based offline RL method by enabling direct one-step action generation via an average velocity field in Flow Matching, eliminating the need for multi-step sampling and complex training pipelines.

Abstract: The generative power of diffusion models (DMs) has recently enabled
high-performing decision-making algorithms in offline reinforcement learning
(RL), achieving state-of-the-art results across standard benchmarks. Among
them, Diffusion Q-Learning (DQL) stands out as a leading method for its
consistently strong performance. Nevertheless, DQL remains limited in practice
due to its reliance on multi-step denoising for action generation during both
training and inference. Although one-step denoising is desirable, simply
applying it to DQL leads to a drastic performance drop. In this work, we
revisit DQL and identify its core limitations. We then propose One-Step Flow
Q-Learning (OFQL), a novel framework that enables efficient one-step action
generation during both training and inference, without requiring auxiliary
models, distillation, or multi-phase training. Specifically, OFQL reformulates
DQL within the sample-efficient Flow Matching (FM) framework. While
conventional FM induces curved generative trajectories that impede one-step
generation, OFQL instead learns an average velocity field that facilitates
direct, accurate action generation. Collectively, OFQL eliminates the need for
multi-step sampling and recursive gradient updates in DQL, resulting in faster
and more robust training and inference. Extensive experiments on the D4RL
benchmark demonstrate that OFQL outperforms DQL and other diffusion-based
baselines, while substantially reducing both training and inference time
compared to DQL.

*Tianheng Ling,Vipin Singh,Chao Qian,Felix Biessmann,Gregor Schiele*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Edge-based forecasting for sewer overflow using quantized Transformer/LSTM on FPGA; energy-accuracy trade-offs with 8-bit models; Transformer more accurate but higher energy than LSTM; deployment energy choices depend on priorities; code on GitHub.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable reliable, on-device, energy-efficient forecasts of sewer overflow under climate-driven extreme weather, reducing reliance on cloud-based computing and enabling rapid local intervention.

Method: End-to-end forecasting framework using lightweight Transformer and LSTM models quantized to integers for on-device execution; automated hardware-aware deployment pipeline to jointly minimize prediction error and energy on an AMD Spartan-7 FPGA; trained on 24 hours of historical data; evaluated on real-world sewer data; compared 8-bit Transformer vs 8-bit LSTM.

Result: 8-bit Transformer achieved MSE 0.0376 with 0.370 mJ per inference; 8-bit LSTM achieved MSE 0.0432 with 0.009 mJ per inference; Transformer more accurate but higher energy; LSTM far more energy-efficient, with longer training time and slightly worse accuracy.

Conclusion: Model choice should align with deployment priorities: LSTM for ultra-low energy and Transformer for higher accuracy. Local, energy-efficient forecasting supports resilient sewer systems. Code available at GitHub repository.

Abstract: Extreme weather events, intensified by climate change, increasingly challenge
aging combined sewer systems, raising the risk of untreated wastewater
overflow. Accurate forecasting of sewer overflow basin filling levels can
provide actionable insights for early intervention, helping mitigating
uncontrolled discharge. In recent years, AI-based forecasting methods have
offered scalable alternatives to traditional physics-based models, but their
reliance on cloud computing limits their reliability during communication
outages. To address this, we propose an end-to-end forecasting framework that
enables energy-efficient inference directly on edge devices. Our solution
integrates lightweight Transformer and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models,
compressed via integer-only quantization for efficient on-device execution.
Moreover, an automated hardware-aware deployment pipeline is used to search for
optimal model configurations by jointly minimizing prediction error and energy
consumption on an AMD Spartan-7 XC7S15 FPGA. Evaluated on real-world sewer
data, the selected 8-bit Transformer model, trained on 24 hours of historical
measurements, achieves high accuracy (MSE 0.0376) at an energy cost of 0.370 mJ
per inference. In contrast, the optimal 8-bit LSTM model requires significantly
less energy (0.009 mJ, over 40x lower) but yields 14.89% worse accuracy (MSE
0.0432) and much longer training time. This trade-off highlights the need to
align model selection with deployment priorities, favoring LSTM for ultra-low
energy consumption or Transformer for higher predictive accuracy. In general,
our work enables local, energy-efficient forecasting, contributing to more
resilient combined sewer systems. All code can be found in the GitHub
Repository (https://github.com/tianheng-ling/EdgeOverflowForecast).

*SM Mazharul Islam,Manfred Huber*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces Categorical Policies for multimodal behavior in continuous control, enabling differentiable sampling and improved exploration, outperforming Gaussian policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of unimodal Gaussian policies in RL for multimodal decision spaces, sparse rewards, and complex dynamics; improve exploration in continuous control.

Method: Proposes a latent categorical distribution to select behavior modes and generate actions conditioned on the chosen mode; presents two differentiable sampling schemes to maintain gradient-based optimization.

Result: Evaluated on the DeepMind Control Suite; faster convergence and better performance than standard Gaussian policies due to enhanced exploration.

Conclusion: Categorical distributions provide a powerful tool for structured exploration and multimodal behavior representation in continuous control.

Abstract: A policy in deep reinforcement learning (RL), either deterministic or
stochastic, is commonly parameterized as a Gaussian distribution alone,
limiting the learned behavior to be unimodal. However, the nature of many
practical decision-making problems favors a multimodal policy that facilitates
robust exploration of the environment and thus to address learning challenges
arising from sparse rewards, complex dynamics, or the need for strategic
adaptation to varying contexts. This issue is exacerbated in continuous control
domains where exploration usually takes place in the vicinity of the predicted
optimal action, either through an additive Gaussian noise or the sampling
process of a stochastic policy. In this paper, we introduce Categorical
Policies to model multimodal behavior modes with an intermediate categorical
distribution, and then generate output action that is conditioned on the
sampled mode. We explore two sampling schemes that ensure differentiable
discrete latent structure while maintaining efficient gradient-based
optimization. By utilizing a latent categorical distribution to select the
behavior mode, our approach naturally expresses multimodality while remaining
fully differentiable via the sampling tricks. We evaluate our multimodal policy
on a set of DeepMind Control Suite environments, demonstrating that through
better exploration, our learned policies converge faster and outperform
standard Gaussian policies. Our results indicate that the Categorical
distribution serves as a powerful tool for structured exploration and
multimodal behavior representation in continuous control.

*Bastian Schäfer,Lennart Purucker,Maciej Janowski,Frank Hutter*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A survey of 53 AutoFE methods reveals widespread usability problems: most methods are hard to use, poorly documented, with no active communities, and lacking support for user-defined time/memory constraints; calls for more usable, well-engineered AutoFE solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate whether automated feature engineering (AutoFE) methods are practically usable by practitioners, addressing a gap where prior work focuses on performance rather than usability.

Method: Empirical survey of 53 AutoFE methods assessing usability indicators such as documentation quality, community activity, configurability, and support for time/memory constraints.

Result: Across the surveyed methods, usability is generally poor: many lack documentation, have no active user communities, and none provide mechanisms for setting time or memory budgets.

Conclusion: Future AutoFE work should emphasize usability and engineering quality, including thorough documentation, active communities, and the ability to enforce time and memory constraints.

Abstract: Tabular data, consisting of rows and columns, is omnipresent across various
machine learning applications. Each column represents a feature, and features
can be combined or transformed to create new, more informative features. Such
feature engineering is essential to achieve peak performance in machine
learning. Since manual feature engineering is expensive and time-consuming, a
substantial effort has been put into automating it. Yet, existing automated
feature engineering (AutoFE) methods have never been investigated regarding
their usability for practitioners. Thus, we investigated 53 AutoFE methods. We
found that these methods are, in general, hard to use, lack documentation, and
have no active communities. Furthermore, no method allows users to set time and
memory constraints, which we see as a necessity for usable automation. Our
survey highlights the need for future work on usable, well-engineered AutoFE
methods.

TL;DR: Two tabular SSP algorithms and one function-approximation SSP algorithm are introduced, with proven asymptotic almost-sure convergence and superior empirical performance in both settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SSP is a fundamental RL problem class that captures many cost criteria; there is a need for convergent methods with strong empirical performance in both tabular and function-approximation regimes.

Method: Develop two tabular SSP algorithms and one function-approx SSP algorithm; prove asymptotic almost-sure convergence for all; compare empirically to existing convergent RL algorithms, showing tabular methods' superiority and the function-approx method's reliability.

Result: Proved asymptotic almost-sure convergence for all algorithms; tabular methods outperform well-known convergent RL algorithms; function-approx method demonstrates reliable performance relative to other function-approx SSP methods.

Conclusion: The work provides convergent, empirically competitive SSP algorithms in both tabular and function-approximation settings, enriching the RL toolbox and validating SSP as a robust framework for various cost criteria.

Abstract: In this paper we propose two algorithms in the tabular setting and an
algorithm for the function approximation setting for the Stochastic Shortest
Path (SSP) problem. SSP problems form an important class of problems in
Reinforcement Learning (RL), as other types of cost-criteria in RL can be
formulated in the setting of SSP. We show asymptotic almost-sure convergence
for all our algorithms. We observe superior performance of our tabular
algorithms compared to other well-known convergent RL algorithms. We further
observe reliable performance of our function approximation algorithm compared
to other algorithms in the function approximation setting.

*Yi Yang,Kei Ikemura,Qingwen Zhang,Xiaomeng Zhu,Ci Li,Nazre Batool,Sina Sharif Mansouri,John Folkesson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper links linear scalarization with multi-task optimization (MTO) methods, showing that well-chosen scalarization weights correlate with favorable MTO metrics, and introduces AutoScale—a two-phase framework that selects weights using MTO metrics to match or exceed complex MTO performance while remaining efficient across diverse datasets, including a large-scale benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explain why fixed linear weights can be competitive with complex MTO methods and develop a principled, efficient way to choose these weights without exhaustive hyperparameter search.

Method: Analyze the relationship between scalarization weights and MTO metrics (e.g., gradient magnitude similarity) to identify patterns of high-performing weights. Develop AutoScale, a two-phase framework that leverages these MTO metrics to guide weight selection for linear scalarization, avoiding expensive optimization/search.

Result: AutoScale achieves superior performance with high efficiency across diverse datasets, including a new large-scale benchmark, demonstrating that MTO-metric–informed weighting can match or surpass more complex MTO methods.

Conclusion: Understanding and leveraging MTO metrics can make simple linear scalarization competitive with, or superior to, complex MTO approaches, enabling scalable, efficient multi-task learning across tasks and datasets.

Abstract: Recent multi-task learning studies suggest that linear scalarization, when
using well-chosen fixed task weights, can achieve comparable to or even better
performance than complex multi-task optimization (MTO) methods. It remains
unclear why certain weights yield optimal performance and how to determine
these weights without relying on exhaustive hyperparameter search. This paper
establishes a direct connection between linear scalarization and MTO methods,
revealing through extensive experiments that well-performing scalarization
weights exhibit specific trends in key MTO metrics, such as high gradient
magnitude similarity. Building on this insight, we introduce AutoScale, a
simple yet effective two-phase framework that uses these MTO metrics to guide
weight selection for linear scalarization, without expensive weight search.
AutoScale consistently shows superior performance with high efficiency across
diverse datasets including a new large-scale benchmark.

*Jiho Park,Huiwen Jia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: New multi-user contextual cascading bandit framework (MCCB) for online ads with parallel user sessions and cascading feedback. Proposes two UCB-based algorithms, UCBBP and AUCBBP, with strong regret guarantees and empirical validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses realistic online advertising settings where multiple users interact with sequentially displayed items, incorporating cascading feedback, parallel context sessions, and heterogeneous arm rewards.

Method: 1) Define MCCB model with cascading feedback, parallel sessions, and heterogeneous rewards. 2) Develop UCBBP (UCB with Backward Planning) and derive regret ~ O~(sqrt(T H N)). 3) Develop AUCBBP (Active UCB with Backward Planning) for simultaneous users, achieving improved context scaling with regret ~ O~(sqrt(T + HN)). 4) Validate via numerical experiments across settings.

Result: UCBBP achieves regret bound ~ sqrt(T H N); AUCBBP achieves tighter bound ~ sqrt(T + HN). Both algorithms demonstrate empirical effectiveness in simulations.

Conclusion: MCCB extends combinatorial bandit frameworks to multi-user, cascading feedback scenarios. AUCBBP offers better scaling with the number of contexts; both methods are supported by theoretical and empirical results, highlighting practical relevance for online ad systems with multiple users.

Abstract: We introduce a Multi-User Contextual Cascading Bandit model, a new
combinatorial bandit framework that captures realistic online advertising
scenarios where multiple users interact with sequentially displayed items
simultaneously. Unlike classical contextual bandits, MCCB integrates three key
structural elements: (i) cascading feedback based on sequential arm exposure,
(ii) parallel context sessions enabling selective exploration, and (iii)
heterogeneous arm-level rewards. We first propose Upper Confidence Bound with
Backward Planning (UCBBP), a UCB-style algorithm tailored to this setting, and
prove that it achieves a regret bound of $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{THN})$ over $T$
episodes, $H$ session steps, and $N$ contexts per episode. Motivated by the
fact that many users interact with the system simultaneously, we introduce a
second algorithm, termed Active Upper Confidence Bound with Backward Planning
(AUCBBP), which shows a strict efficiency improvement in context scaling, i.e.,
user scaling, with a regret bound of $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T+HN})$. We validate
our theoretical findings via numerical experiments, demonstrating the empirical
effectiveness of both algorithms under various settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Create a principled framework to compare, combine, and analyze diverse efficiency methods (pruning, quantization, distillation, efficient architectures) and their cost-quality trade-offs, and to enable automated policy learning.

Method: Define Knob-Meter-Rule triples; map pruning, quantization, distillation, and parameter-efficient architectures to KMR representations; provide algorithmic templates and a Budgeted-KMR algorithm for iterative optimization; illustrate by instantiating known methods as KMR triples.

Result: A mathematically precise, modular framework that reveals relationships between efficiency techniques, supports hybrid pipelines and policy-driven optimization, and offers practical templates for implementation.

Conclusion: KMR provides a unifying conceptual and practical tool for model efficiency research, enabling automated policy learning, dynamic adaptation, and theoretical analysis of cost-quality trade-offs.

Abstract: We introduce the Knob-Meter-Rule (KMR) framework, a unified formalism for
representing and reasoning about model efficiency techniques in deep learning.
By abstracting diverse methods, including pruning, quantization, knowledge
distillation, and parameter-efficient architectures, into a consistent set of
controllable knobs, deterministic rules, and measurable meters, KMR provides a
mathematically precise and modular perspective on efficiency optimization. The
framework enables systematic composition of multiple techniques, flexible
policy-driven application, and iterative budgeted optimization through the
Budgeted-KMR algorithm. We demonstrate how well-known efficiency methods can be
instantiated as KMR triples and present concise algorithmic templates for each.
The framework highlights underlying relationships between methods, facilitates
hybrid pipelines, and lays the foundation for future research in automated
policy learning, dynamic adaptation, and theoretical analysis of cost-quality
trade-offs. Overall, KMR offers both a conceptual and practical tool for
unifying and advancing model efficiency research.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A differentiable fine-tuning framework for extreme quantization using learnable per-layer bit-width with STE, noise scale, and penalties, achieving strong accuracy at W1A1 while keeping STE efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantized neural networks can be modeled as a chain of noisy channels where reducing bit-width lowers capacity; FP checkpoints define the maximum input rate. To maintain performance under aggressive quantization, one must identify bottlenecks and adapt bit-widths across layers during fine-tuning.

Method: Use a fully differentiable Straight-Through Estimator (STE) with learnable bit-width, noise scale, and clamp bounds. Enforce a target overall bit-width via an exterior-point penalty. Stabilize training with mild smoothing through distillation and track capacity dynamics to locate quantization bottlenecks.

Result: The method achieves competitive accuracy down to the extreme W1A1 setting while retaining the efficiency of STE.

Conclusion: A simple, differentiable approach to per-layer bit-width adaptation during fine-tuning can effectively manage capacity under extreme quantization, delivering strong performance without sacrificing STE efficiency.

Abstract: Quantized neural networks can be viewed as a chain of noisy channels, where
rounding in each layer reduces capacity as bit-width shrinks; the
floating-point (FP) checkpoint sets the maximum input rate. We track capacity
dynamics as the average bit-width decreases and identify resulting quantization
bottlenecks by casting fine-tuning as a smooth, constrained optimization
problem. Our approach employs a fully differentiable Straight-Through Estimator
(STE) with learnable bit-width, noise scale and clamp bounds, and enforces a
target bit-width via an exterior-point penalty; mild metric smoothing (via
distillation) stabilizes training. Despite its simplicity, the method attains
competitive accuracy down to the extreme W1A1 setting while retaining the
efficiency of STE.

### [155] [ASDFormer: A Transformer with Mixtures of Pooling-Classifier Experts for Robust Autism Diagnosis and Biomarker Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14005)
*Mohammad Izadi,Mehran Safayani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ASDFormer is a Transformer with a Mixture of Pooling-Classifier Experts (MoE) that models community-based fMRI connectivity to detect ASD, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on ABIDE and enabling biomarker discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASD involves complex, widespread disruptions in brain connectivity. Functional communities and inter-regional interactions are sensitive markers of ASD, but capturing these patterns requires models that can focus on diverse connectivity signatures while remaining interpretable.

Method: A Transformer-based architecture (ASDFormer) augmented with a Mixture of Pooling-Classifier Experts (MoE). The model uses attention to adaptively weight different brain regions and connectivity patterns across functional communities, processing ROI-level fMRI signals to detect ASD. Applied to the ABIDE dataset with ROIs grouped into functional communities.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art diagnostic accuracy on ABIDE and provides robust, interpretable insights into functional connectivity disruptions linked to ASD, enabling biomarker discovery.

Conclusion: ASDFormer demonstrates that combining Transformer attention with MoE-based specialization yields strong diagnostic performance and interpretable biomarkers for ASD, supporting its potential as a clinical biomarker discovery tool.

Abstract: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition
marked by disruptions in brain connectivity. Functional MRI (fMRI) offers a
non-invasive window into large-scale neural dynamics by measuring
blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals across the brain. These signals can
be modeled as interactions among Regions of Interest (ROIs), which are grouped
into functional communities based on their underlying roles in brain function.
Emerging evidence suggests that connectivity patterns within and between these
communities are particularly sensitive to ASD-related alterations. Effectively
capturing these patterns and identifying interactions that deviate from typical
development is essential for improving ASD diagnosis and enabling biomarker
discovery. In this work, we introduce ASDFormer, a Transformer-based
architecture that incorporates a Mixture of Pooling-Classifier Experts (MoE) to
capture neural signatures associated with ASD. By integrating multiple
specialized expert branches with attention mechanisms, ASDFormer adaptively
emphasizes different brain regions and connectivity patterns relevant to
autism. This enables both improved classification performance and more
interpretable identification of disorder-related biomarkers. Applied to the
ABIDE dataset, ASDFormer achieves state-of-the-art diagnostic accuracy and
reveals robust insights into functional connectivity disruptions linked to ASD,
highlighting its potential as a tool for biomarker discovery.

### [156] [Typed Topological Structures Of Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14008)
*Wanjun Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces typed topological spaces on finite datasets in R^2, organizing X into tracks and ordered components via a quotient, and encodes cross-track relations as a typed-II pseudotree to enable new data-analytic algorithms (e.g., convex hull, holes, clustering, anomaly detection).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extend finite-topology ideas to practical data analysis by typing open sets, enabling redefinition of topological notions and providing a structured representation of internal dataset organization to guide algorithms.

Method: Define a specialized set of open-set types (typed topology) on X; construct R^2's natural quotient where X forms tracks whose components are ordered and mapped to integers; model cross-track connectivity with a typed-II pseudotree; propose algorithms that leverage this structure.

Result: A theoretical framework and data-structure (typed-II pseudotree) for representing the inner structure of X, illustrating potential new algorithms for convex hull, holes, clustering, and anomaly detection.

Conclusion: Typed topology on finite datasets yields a robust platform for geometric/topological data analysis, connecting general topology with practical algorithm design.

Abstract: A datatset $X$ on $R^2$ is a finite topological space. Current research of a
dataset focuses on statistical methods and the algebraic topological method
\cite{carlsson}. In \cite{hu}, the concept of typed topological space was
introduced and showed to have the potential for studying finite topological
spaces, such as a dataset. It is a new method from the general topology
perspective. A typed topological space is a topological space whose open sets
are assigned types. Topological concepts and methods can be redefined using
open sets of certain types. In this article, we develop a special set of types
and its related typed topology on a dataset $X$. Using it, we can investigate
the inner structure of $X$. In particular, $R^2$ has a natural quotient space,
in which $X$ is organized into tracks, and each track is split into components.
Those components are in a order. Further, they can be represented by an integer
sequence. Components crossing tracks form branches, and the relationship can be
well represented by a type of pseudotree (called typed-II pseudotree). Such
structures provide a platform for new algorithms for problems such as
calculating convex hull, holes, clustering and anomaly detection.

### [157] [Efficient Knowledge Graph Unlearning with Zeroth-order Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14013)
*Yang Xiao,Ruimeng Ye,Bohan Liu,Xiaolong Ma,Bo Hui*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes an efficient knowledge graph (KG) unlearning method that uses an influence-based framework to estimate parameter changes due to data removal, avoiding heavy first-/second-order derivatives. It employs a Taylor expansion, Fisher information, and zeroth-order optimization to approximate the inverse-Hessian vector product, achieving faster and higher-quality unlearning on large KGs. The authors release their code.



<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Regulatory pressure (e.g., Right to be Forgotten) motivates removing training data and its influence from models. Full retraining is costly, and knowledge graphs (KGs) have complex structures and semantic relations, complicating unlearning and making influence-based methods computationally expensive on large-scale graphs.

Method: Define an influence function for KG unlearning and approximate model sensitivity without computing expensive first-/second-order derivatives. Use Taylor expansion to estimate parameter changes from data removal. To avoid dense gradient/Hessian calculations, employ Fisher matrices and zeroth-order optimization to approximate the inverse-Hessian–vector product without constructing full computation graphs.

Result: Empirical results show the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art graph unlearning baselines in both unlearning efficiency and unlearning quality on KG tasks.

Conclusion: The paper presents a scalable, practical approach to KG unlearning that reduces computational overhead while maintaining effective data removal, with open-source code available at the provided GitHub link.

Abstract: Due to regulations like the Right to be Forgotten, there is growing demand
for removing training data and its influence from models. Since full retraining
is costly, various machine unlearning methods have been proposed. In this
paper, we firstly present an efficient knowledge graph (KG) unlearning
algorithm. We remark that KG unlearning is nontrivial due to the distinctive
structure of KG and the semantic relations between entities. Also, unlearning
by estimating the influence of removed components incurs significant
computational overhead when applied to large-scale knowledge graphs. To this
end, we define an influence function for KG unlearning and propose to
approximate the model's sensitivity without expensive computation of
first-order and second-order derivatives for parameter updates. Specifically,
we use Taylor expansion to estimate the parameter changes caused by data
removal. Given that the first-order gradients and second-order derivatives
dominate the computational load, we use the Fisher matrices and zeroth-order
optimization to approximate the inverse-Hessian vector product without
constructing the computational graphs. Our experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art graph unlearning
baselines significantly in terms of unlearning efficiency and unlearning
quality. Our code is released at https://github.com/NKUShaw/ZOWFKGIF.

### [158] [BLIPs: Bayesian Learned Interatomic Potentials](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14022)
*Dario Coscia,Pim de Haan,Max Welling*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BLIP introduces a scalable Bayesian framework for MLIPs that yields calibrated uncertainty estimates and improved robustness, including during fine-tuning of pretrained models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLIPs lack reliable uncertainty estimates and often fail in data-scarce or out-of-distribution regimes, hindering active learning and rigorous validation against quantum calculations.

Method: An adaptive variational dropout-based Bayesian framework compatible with various MLIP architectures (including equivariant GNNs), enabling uncertainty-aware training and efficient inference for energies and forces; supports fine-tuning pretrained models.

Result: Empirical results show better predictive accuracy than standard MLIPs and well-calibrated uncertainties, especially in data-scarce or heavy out-of-distribution scenarios; ends with consistent gains on fine-tuning pretrained models.

Conclusion: BLIP provides a scalable, architecture-agnostic approach to uncertainty estimation in MLIPs, facilitating active learning and more reliable chemistry simulations.

Abstract: Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) are becoming a central tool
in simulation-based chemistry. However, like most deep learning models, MLIPs
struggle to make accurate predictions on out-of-distribution data or when
trained in a data-scarce regime, both common scenarios in simulation-based
chemistry. Moreover, MLIPs do not provide uncertainty estimates by
construction, which are fundamental to guide active learning pipelines and to
ensure the accuracy of simulation results compared to quantum calculations. To
address this shortcoming, we propose BLIPs: Bayesian Learned Interatomic
Potentials. BLIP is a scalable, architecture-agnostic variational Bayesian
framework for training or fine-tuning MLIPs, built on an adaptive version of
Variational Dropout. BLIP delivers well-calibrated uncertainty estimates and
minimal computational overhead for energy and forces prediction at inference
time, while integrating seamlessly with (equivariant) message-passing
architectures. Empirical results on simulation-based computational chemistry
tasks demonstrate improved predictive accuracy with respect to standard MLIPs,
and trustworthy uncertainty estimates, especially in data-scarse or heavy
out-of-distribution regimes. Moreover, fine-tuning pretrained MLIPs with BLIP
yields consistent performance gains and calibrated uncertainties.

### [159] [Learning from Preferences and Mixed Demonstrations in General Settings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14027)
*Jason R Brown,Carl Henrik Ek,Robert D Mullins*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework (LEOPARD) learns reward functions from reward-rational partial orders over observations, integrating preferences and ranked demonstrations to improve sample efficiency and scalability across domains; combining feedback types often helps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Designing suitable reward functions in RL is difficult for complex tasks. Existing methods that combine human preferences and demonstrations are often ad-hoc, domain-specific, or scale poorly. There is a need for a flexible, scalable approach that can leverage diverse human feedback.

Method: Introduce reward-rational partial orderings over observations as a unifying data representation. Propose LEOPARD (Learning Estimated Objectives from Preferences And Ranked Demonstrations), a practical algorithm that learns reward functions from a broad range of human data, including negative demonstrations, and can integrate multiple feedback types.

Result: LEOPARD achieves superior performance over baselines with limited feedback, demonstrating data efficiency and scalability. It also enables analysis of learning from multiple feedback modalities, showing combining feedback types can be beneficial.

Conclusion: Reward learning from heterogeneous human feedback is viable and scalable. LEOPARD provides a practical framework for estimating objectives from preferences and demonstrations, supporting negative demonstrations and multiple feedback types to improve reward learning across domains.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning is a general method for learning in sequential
settings, but it can often be difficult to specify a good reward function when
the task is complex. In these cases, preference feedback or expert
demonstrations can be used instead. However, existing approaches utilising both
together are often ad-hoc, rely on domain-specific properties, or won't scale.
We develop a new framing for learning from human data, \emph{reward-rational
partial orderings over observations}, designed to be flexible and scalable.
Based on this we introduce a practical algorithm, LEOPARD: Learning Estimated
Objectives from Preferences And Ranked Demonstrations. LEOPARD can learn from a
broad range of data, including negative demonstrations, to efficiently learn
reward functions across a wide range of domains. We find that when a limited
amount of preference and demonstration feedback is available, LEOPARD
outperforms existing baselines by a significant margin. Furthermore, we use
LEOPARD to investigate learning from many types of feedback compared to just a
single one, and find that combining feedback types is often beneficial.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes Chain-of-Agents (CoA) and Agent Foundation Models (AFMs) that simulate end-to-end multi-agent collaboration inside a single LLM, using distillation and agentic RL to achieve SOTA on web/code agent benchmarks, with fully open-source resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-agent systems rely on manual prompt/workflow engineering and multiple frameworks, resulting in inefficiency and limited data-centric learning. The work seeks end-to-end, agentic reasoning within one model to enable scalable, learnable, and data-driven collaboration.

Method: Introduce the CoA paradigm where an LLM dynamically activates tool agents and role-playing agents to emulate multi-agent collaboration in a single pass. Use a multi-agent distillation framework to convert existing multi-agent trajectories into CoA trajectories for supervised fine-tuning. Apply agentic reinforcement learning on verifiable agentic tasks to enhance capabilities, culminating in Agent Foundation Models (AFMs).

Result: AFMs achieve new state-of-the-art performance across diverse benchmarks in both web agent and code agent domains.

Conclusion: The work provides open-sourced model weights, training/evaluation code, and training data, offering a solid starting point for future research on agent models and agentic RL, and demonstrating effective end-to-end chain-of-agents within one model.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and multi-agent systems have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex problem-solving tasks such as
deep research, vibe coding, and mathematical reasoning. However, most existing
multi-agent systems are built upon manual prompt/workflow engineering with
sophisticated agent frameworks, making them computationally inefficient, less
capable, and can not benefit from data-centric learning. In this work, we
introduce Chain-of-Agents (CoA), a novel paradigm of LLM reasoning that enables
native end-to-end complex problem-solving in the same way as a multi-agent
system (i.e., multi-turn problem solving with multiple tools and multiple
agents) within one model. In chain-of-agents problem-solving, the model
dynamically activates different tool agents and role-playing agents to simulate
multi-agent collaboration in an end-to-end fashion. To elicit end-to-end
chain-of-agents problem-solving abilities in LLMs, we introduce a multi-agent
distillation framework to distill state-of-the-art multi-agent systems into
chain-of-agents trajectories for agentic supervised fine-tuning. We then use
agentic reinforcement learning on verifiable agentic tasks to further improve
the models' capabilities on chain-of-agents problem solving. We call the
resulting models Agent Foundation Models (AFMs). Our empirical studies
demonstrate that AFM establishes new state-of-the-art performance across
diverse benchmarks in both web agent and code agent settings. We make the
entire research, including the model weights, code for training and evaluation,
and the training data, fully open-sourced, which offers a solid starting point
for future research on agent models and agentic RL.

### [161] [Cognitive Workspace: Active Memory Management for LLMs -- An Empirical Study of Functional Infinite Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13171)
*Tao An*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Cognitive Workspace introduces an active memory-management paradigm that extends beyond traditional retrieval-augmented generation by emulating human external memory use. It reports substantial memory reuse and efficiency gains with strong statistics, arguing for a shift from retrieval to cognitive augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM context management is fundamentally limited: passive retrieval and fixed context windows fail to capture dynamic, task-driven memory use. The work draws on cognitive science to enable metacognitive, active external memory augmentation.

Method: Proposes three innovations: (1) active memory management with deliberate information curation; (2) hierarchical cognitive buffers enabling persistent working states; (3) task-driven context optimization that dynamically adapts to cognitive demands. Grounded in Baddeley’s working memory, Clark’s extended mind, and Hutchins’ distributed cognition, and synthesizes 50+ papers into a comprehensive framework; includes empirical validation across tasks.

Result: Empirical validation shows 58.6% memory reuse (54–60% across tasks) vs 0% for traditional RAG, and 17–18% net efficiency gain despite 3.3× higher operation counts. Statistical tests show p < 0.001 and Cohen’s d > 23 across multiple task types, presenting the first quantitative evidence for active memory superiority in LLMs.

Conclusion: Proposes a fundamental shift from information retrieval to genuine cognitive augmentation, positioning Cognitive Workspace as a foundational paradigm for extending LLM capabilities through active, structured external memory management.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face fundamental limitations in context
management despite recent advances extending context windows to millions of
tokens. We propose Cognitive Workspace, a novel paradigm that transcends
traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by emulating human cognitive
mechanisms of external memory use. Drawing from cognitive science foundations
including Baddeley's working memory model, Clark's extended mind thesis, and
Hutchins' distributed cognition framework, we demonstrate that current passive
retrieval systems fail to capture the dynamic, task-driven nature of human
memory management. Our analysis of 2024-2025 developments reveals that while
techniques like Infini-attention and StreamingLLM achieve impressive context
lengths, they lack the metacognitive awareness and active planning capabilities
essential for true cognitive extension. Cognitive Workspace addresses these
limitations through three core innovations: (1) active memory management with
deliberate information curation, (2) hierarchical cognitive buffers enabling
persistent working states, and (3) task-driven context optimization that
dynamically adapts to cognitive demands. Empirical validation demonstrates
Cognitive Workspace achieves an average 58.6% memory reuse rate (ranging from
54-60% across different tasks) compared to 0% for traditional RAG, with 17-18%
net efficiency gain despite 3.3x higher operation counts. Statistical analysis
confirms these advantages with p < 0.001 and Cohen's d > 23 across multiple
task types, establishing the first quantitative evidence for active memory
superiority in LLM systems. We present a comprehensive theoretical framework
synthesizing insights from 50+ recent papers, positioning Cognitive Workspace
as a fundamental shift from information retrieval to genuine cognitive
augmentation.

### [162] [AlphaEval: A Comprehensive and Efficient Evaluation Framework for Formula Alpha Mining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13174)
*Hongjun Ding,Binqi Chen,Jinsheng Huang,Taian Guo,Zhengyang Mao,Guoyi Shao,Lutong Zou,Luchen Liu,Ming Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AlphaEval is a parallelizable, backtest-free framework for evaluating alpha mining models across five dimensions (predictive power, stability, robustness, financial logic, diversity), offering comparable evaluation quality to backtesting with greater efficiency and richer insights; it is open-source.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation in alpha mining relies on backtests or single metrics like correlations, which are costly, biased, or incomplete, and reproducibility is hampered by closed-source models. A unified, efficient, multi-dimensional, and open framework is needed to advance the field.

Method: Proposes AlphaEval, a unified evaluation pipeline that is parallelizable and backtest-free, assessing alphas on five dimensions: predictive power, stability, robustness to market perturbations, financial logic, and diversity. Demonstrates results via extensive experiments across representative alpha mining algorithms.

Result: Experiments show AlphaEval yields evaluation consistency comparable to comprehensive backtesting while providing richer insights and higher efficiency. It also better identifies superior alphas compared to traditional single-metric screening. All tools are open-source to promote reproducibility.

Conclusion: AlphaEval addresses key evaluation gaps in alpha mining by offering a multi-faceted, efficient, and reproducible framework, enabling fairer comparisons and accelerating progress in the field.

Abstract: Formula alpha mining, which generates predictive signals from financial data,
is critical for quantitative investment. Although various algorithmic
approaches-such as genetic programming, reinforcement learning, and large
language models-have significantly expanded the capacity for alpha discovery,
systematic evaluation remains a key challenge. Existing evaluation metrics
predominantly include backtesting and correlation-based measures. Backtesting
is computationally intensive, inherently sequential, and sensitive to specific
strategy parameters. Correlation-based metrics, though efficient, assess only
predictive ability and overlook other crucial properties such as temporal
stability, robustness, diversity, and interpretability. Additionally, the
closed-source nature of most existing alpha mining models hinders
reproducibility and slows progress in this field. To address these issues, we
propose AlphaEval, a unified, parallelizable, and backtest-free evaluation
framework for automated alpha mining models. AlphaEval assesses the overall
quality of generated alphas along five complementary dimensions: predictive
power, stability, robustness to market perturbations, financial logic, and
diversity. Extensive experiments across representative alpha mining algorithms
demonstrate that AlphaEval achieves evaluation consistency comparable to
comprehensive backtesting, while providing more comprehensive insights and
higher efficiency. Furthermore, AlphaEval effectively identifies superior
alphas compared to traditional single-metric screening approaches. All
implementations and evaluation tools are open-sourced to promote
reproducibility and community engagement.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Studying how to fit ontologies and constraints to finite relational data across description logics EL/ELI and various TGDs, with complexity analysis, fitting algorithms, and finite-basis results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable learning of ontologies and dependencies from finite data by understanding what can be fit, with what complexity, and when finite bases exist or not.

Method: Formal computational analysis of fitting problems for EL, ELI, and several TGD classes (full, guarded, frontier-guarded, frontier-one) and inclusion dependencies; design of fitting algorithms; investigation of finite bases.

Result: Provided exact complexity characterizations; designed fitting algorithms; showed finite bases exist for EL, ELI, guarded TGDs, and inclusion dependencies, but generally do not exist for full, frontier-guarded, and frontier-one TGDs.

Conclusion: Learning ontologies and dependencies from finite data is feasible in certain languages (EL, ELI, guarded TGDs, IDs) but impossible to guarantee in others (full, frontier-guarded, frontier-one), due to nonexistence of finite bases in those cases.

Abstract: We study the problem of fitting ontologies and constraints to positive and
negative examples that take the form of a finite relational structure. As
ontology and constraint languages, we consider the description logics
$\mathcal{E\mkern-2mu L}$ and $\mathcal{E\mkern-2mu LI}$ as well as several
classes of tuple-generating dependencies (TGDs): full, guarded,
frontier-guarded, frontier-one, and unrestricted TGDs as well as inclusion
dependencies. We pinpoint the exact computational complexity, design
algorithms, and analyze the size of fitting ontologies and TGDs. We also
investigate the related problem of constructing a finite basis of concept
inclusions / TGDs for a given set of finite structures. While finite bases
exist for $\mathcal{E\mkern-2mu L}$, $\mathcal{E\mkern-2mu LI}$, guarded TGDs,
and inclusion dependencies, they in general do not exist for full,
frontier-guarded and frontier-one TGDs.

*Cong Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CESQL integrates interpretability, execution-guided parsing, filtering adjustments, logical correlation refinements, and model fusion to enhance text-to-SQL for WHERE clauses. It yields notable accuracy gains on WikiSQL and enables data-efficient conditional-value prediction without relying on labeled condition-column data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To boost the foundational capabilities and generalization of text-to-SQL models in real-world applications, with a focus on robust semantic parsing of WHERE clauses, data efficiency, and reduced dependence on manually labeled data.

Method: Combine model interpretability analysis with an execution-guided strategy for WHERE clause parsing, augmented by filtering adjustments, logical correlation refinements, and model fusion, resulting in the CESQL architecture for conditional enhancement.

Result: CESQL achieves substantial accuracy gains on the WikiSQL dataset (single-table queries) and improves conditional-value prediction by reducing reliance on condition-column data and avoiding the need for manually labeled training data.

Conclusion: The approach offers fresh perspectives for tackling complex queries and irregular data in real-world databases, contributing to more robust text-to-SQL systems and guiding future research in this area.

Abstract: To elevate the foundational capabilities and generalization prowess of the
text-to-SQL model in real-world applications, we integrate model
interpretability analysis with execution-guided strategy for semantic parsing
of WHERE clauses in SQL queries. Furthermore, we augment this approach with
filtering adjustments, logical correlation refinements, and model fusion,
culminating in the design of the CESQL model that facilitates conditional
enhancement. Our model excels on the WikiSQL dataset, which is emblematic of
single-table database query tasks, markedly boosting the accuracy of prediction
outcomes. When predicting conditional values in WHERE clauses, we have not only
minimized our dependence on data within the condition columns of tables but
also circumvented the impact of manually labeled training data. Our hope is
that this endeavor to enhance accuracy in processing basic database queries
will offer fresh perspectives for research into handling complex queries and
scenarios featuring irregular data in real-world database environments.

### [166] [Search-Time Data Contamination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13180)
*Ziwen Han,Meher Mankikar,Julian Michael,Zifan Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A new data-leakage problem, called search-time contamination (STC), undermines evaluation of search-based LLM agents by surfacing test-data sources (notably HuggingFace) during retrieval and enabling copying of answers. On Humanity's Last Exam, SimpleQA, and GPQA, about 3% of questions show ground-truth Q&A surfaced; blocking HuggingFace reduces contaminated accuracy by ~15% on the affected subset. STC is not limited to HuggingFace; the paper proposes benchmark-design and reporting best practices and releases logs for auditability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To preserve benchmark integrity for search-based LLM agents that gather information from online sources, by identifying and mitigating a novel leakage channel where evaluation data leaks into the retrieval path and can inflate performance.

Method: Analyze logs from three benchmarks (HLE, SimpleQA, GPQA) in search-based LLM evaluations, detect when retrieved sources contain the test question or near-duplicates (e.g., HuggingFace datasets), quantify incidence of leakage, perform an ablation to show other sources, block HuggingFace and assess impact, and release complete logs for auditing.

Result: Approximately 3% of questions leak ground-truth QA from HuggingFace into the agent reasoning. After blocking HuggingFace, accuracy on the contaminated subset drops by about 15%. Ablation suggests additional leakage sources beyond HuggingFace. Logs of experiments are publicly released to facilitate auditing.

Conclusion: STC reveals a novel leakage pathway in evaluating search-based LLMs. Benchmark design and result reporting should incorporate leakage controls, source-filtering, auditing, and transparency. The work underscores the need for robust evaluation protocols to maintain benchmark relevance and trustworthiness.

Abstract: Data contamination refers to the leakage of evaluation data into model
training data, resulting in overfitting to supposedly held-out test sets and
compromising test validity. We identify an analogous issue, search-time
contamination (STC), in evaluating search-based LLM agents which use tools to
gather information from online sources when answering user queries. STC occurs
when the retrieval step surfaces a source containing the test question (or a
near-duplicate) alongside its answer, enabling agents to copy rather than
genuinely infer or reason, undermining benchmark integrity. We find that
HuggingFace, an online platform hosting evaluation datasets, appears among
retrieved sources in search based agent logs. Consequently, agents often
explicitly acknowledge discovering question answer pairs from HuggingFace
within their reasoning chains. On three commonly used capability benchmarks:
Humanity's Last Exam (HLE), SimpleQA, and GPQA, we demonstrate that for
approximately 3% of questions, search-based agents directly find the datasets
with ground truth labels on HuggingFace. When millions of evaluation queries
target the same benchmark, even small, repeated leaks can accelerate the
benchmark's obsolescence, shortening its intended lifecycle. After HuggingFace
is blocked, we observe a drop in accuracy on the contaminated subset of
approximately 15%. We further show through ablation experiments that publicly
accessible evaluation datasets on HuggingFace may not be the sole source of
STC. To this end, we conclude by proposing best practices for benchmark design
and result reporting to address this novel form of leakage and ensure
trustworthy evaluation of search-based LLM agents. To facilitate the auditing
of evaluation results, we also publicly release the complete logs from our
experiments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As generative models scale to larger inputs across language, vision, and video, token-level compute becomes a key bottleneck. While prior work suggests only a subset of tokens significantly influence downstream predictions, most token selection methods are static, modality-specific, or incompatible with autoregressive generation.

Method: Propose QuickMerge: a lightweight token merging framework that dynamically selects a reduced number of tokens based on attention-norm magnitude; uses an entropy-based budget estimator to control token reduction; adds a lightweight transformer prior trained over merged tokens to preserve autoregressive compatibility.

Result: Evaluated across multi-modality domains, showing consistent improvements in compute-accuracy tradeoffs; reduces token counts substantially and matches or exceeds the performance of learned tokenizers and fixed-patch baselines.

Conclusion: QuickMerge enables accurate generation with fewer tokens while preserving autoregressive alignment, offering a general, cross-modality approach to efficient generation.

Abstract: As generative models scale to larger inputs across language, vision, and
video domains, the cost of token-level computation has become a key bottleneck.
While prior work suggests that only a subset of tokens significantly influence
downstream predictions, most token selection methods are static,
modality-specific, or incompatible with autoregressive generation. In this
paper, we propose QuickMerge, a lightweight token merging framework designed
for efficient next-token prediction.
  QuickMerge dynamically selects a reduced number of tokens based on attention
norm magnitude, guided by an entropy-based budget estimator. To preserve
autoregressive compatibility, we introduce a lightweight transformer prior
trained over the merged token sequence. By combining semantic salience
estimation, flexible token budgets, and AR alignment, QuickMerge enables
accurate generation with fewer tokens.
  We evaluate QuickMerge across multi-modality domains, demonstrating
consistent improvements in compute-accuracy tradeoffs. Specifically, QuickMerge
reduces token counts sustantially while matching as well as exceeding the
performance of learned tokenizers and fixed-patch baselines.

### [168] [AI sustains higher strategic tension than humans in chess](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13213)
*Adamo Cerioli,Edward D. Lee,Vito D. P. Servedio*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A network-based measure shows top AIs maintain higher strategic tension and longer-term complexity than humans in chess; AI tension scales with algorithmic complexity and humans show spikes around Elo 1600 and 2300; AI favors sustained interconnected positions while humans limit tension; implications for AI deployment in complex strategic settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how strategic tension evolves in human vs human and AI vs AI chess to inform how AI could be used in real-world strategic environments.

Method: Introduce a network-based metric of piece-to-piece interactions to quantify ongoing strategic tension on the board; analyze AI vs AI and human vs human games; study tension trajectories, cumulative tension, and its relationship with algorithmic complexity and Elo-based expertise.

Result: Competitive AI players sustain higher levels of strategic tension for longer periods than elite human players. Cumulative tension varies with algorithmic complexity for AI; in human-played games, tension increases abruptly with expertise around 1600 Elo and again at 2300 Elo. AI profiles show a preference for interconnected positions balancing offense and defense over long durations, whereas human play tends to limit tension and overall game complexity.

Conclusion: The divergence suggests cognitive limitations shape human play and enable adaptive strategies, while AI can maintain sustained strategic tension; implications include cautious and context-aware deployment of AI in complex strategic environments.

Abstract: Strategic decision-making involves managing the tension between immediate
opportunities and long-term objectives. We study this trade-off in chess by
characterizing and comparing dynamics between human vs human and AI vs AI
games. We propose a network-based metric of piece-to-piece interaction to
quantify the ongoing strategic tension on the board. Its evolution in games
reveals that the most competitive AI players sustain higher levels of strategic
tension for longer durations than elite human players. Cumulative tension
varies with algorithmic complexity for AI and correspondingly in human-played
games increases abruptly with expertise at about 1600 Elo and again at 2300
Elo. The profiles reveal different approaches. Highly competitive AI tolerates
interconnected positions balanced between offensive and defensive tactics over
long periods. Human play, in contrast, limits tension and game complexity,
which may reflect cognitive limitations and adaptive strategies. The difference
may have implications for AI usage in complex, strategic environments.

### [169] [Explicit v.s. Implicit Memory: Exploring Multi-hop Complex Reasoning Over Personalized Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13250)
*Zeyu Zhang,Yang Zhang,Haoran Tan,Rui Li,Xu Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A new multi-hop personalized reasoning task and dataset for evaluating memory mechanisms in LLM-based agents; compares explicit and implicit memory, introduces HybridMem, and releases code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Personalization requires memory, but current work poorly handles multi-hop reasoning over large, personalized information; need unified task/dataset and evaluation to understand memory approaches.

Method: Define the task; build dataset and unified evaluation framework; implement multiple explicit and implicit memory methods; run comprehensive experiments; analyze strengths/weaknesses; develop HybridMem by combining paradigms.

Result: Comprehensive experiments show varying strengths/weaknesses of memory methods; HybridMem addresses limitations and demonstrates effectiveness; dataset/code released.

Conclusion: This work advances multi-hop personalized reasoning by providing a task, dataset, and HybridMem approach; lays groundwork for future research and practical personalized agents.

Abstract: In large language model-based agents, memory serves as a critical capability
for achieving personalization by storing and utilizing users' information.
Although some previous studies have adopted memory to implement user
personalization, they typically focus on preference alignment and simple
question-answering. However, in the real world, complex tasks often require
multi-hop reasoning on a large amount of user information, which poses
significant challenges for current memory approaches. To address this
limitation, we propose the multi-hop personalized reasoning task to explore how
different memory mechanisms perform in multi-hop reasoning over personalized
information. We explicitly define this task and construct a dataset along with
a unified evaluation framework. Then, we implement various explicit and
implicit memory methods and conduct comprehensive experiments. We evaluate
their performance on this task from multiple perspectives and analyze their
strengths and weaknesses. Besides, we explore hybrid approaches that combine
both paradigms and propose the HybridMem method to address their limitations.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model through extensive
experiments. To benefit the research community, we release this project at
https://github.com/nuster1128/MPR.

*Di Zhang,Xue Jia,Tran Ba Hung,Seong Hoon Jang,Linda Zhang,Ryuhei Sato,Yusuke Hashimoto,Toyoto Sato,Kiyoe Konno,Shin-ichi Orimo,Hao Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A data-driven AI workflow, DIVE, extracts and organizes experimental data from graphical elements in literature using a multi-agent system, improving data extraction accuracy/coverage for solid-state hydrogen storage materials and enabling a rapid inverse-design workflow to discover new compositions in ~2 minutes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unstructured data in figures/tables across publications hinders scalable AI-driven materials discovery; unlocking this data enables robust databases and accelerated design.

Method: Descriptive Interpretation of Visual Expression (DIVE) uses a multi-agent pipeline to read, interpret, and structure experimental data from figures/tTables, building a curated database (>30,000 entries from ~4,000 papers) and enabling rapid inverse design.

Result: DIVE yields 10–15% accuracy/coverage gains over commercial multimodal models and >30% gains over open-source models; enables ~2-minute identification of previously unreported hydrogen storage compositions.

Conclusion: The AI workflow and agent design are transferable to other materials domains, offering a scalable paradigm for AI-driven materials discovery from literature-derived data.

Abstract: Data-driven artificial intelligence (AI) approaches are fundamentally
transforming the discovery of new materials. Despite the unprecedented
availability of materials data in the scientific literature, much of this
information remains trapped in unstructured figures and tables, hindering the
construction of large language model (LLM)-based AI agent for automated
materials design. Here, we present the Descriptive Interpretation of Visual
Expression (DIVE) multi-agent workflow, which systematically reads and
organizes experimental data from graphical elements in scientific literatures.
We focus on solid-state hydrogen storage materials-a class of materials central
to future clean-energy technologies and demonstrate that DIVE markedly improves
the accuracy and coverage of data extraction compared to the direct extraction
by multimodal models, with gains of 10-15% over commercial models and over 30%
relative to open-source models. Building on a curated database of over 30,000
entries from 4,000 publications, we establish a rapid inverse design workflow
capable of identifying previously unreported hydrogen storage compositions in
two minutes. The proposed AI workflow and agent design are broadly transferable
across diverse materials, providing a paradigm for AI-driven materials
discovery.

### [171] [CardAIc-Agents: A Multimodal Framework with Hierarchical Adaptation for Cardiac Care Support](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13256)
*Yuting Zhang,Karina V. Bunting,Asgher Champsi,Xiaoxia Wang,Wenqi Lu,Alexander Thorley,Sandeep S Hothi,Zhaowen Qiu,Dipak Kotecha,Jinming Duan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A multimodal, tool-augmented AI framework (CardAIc-Agents) enhances adaptive planning and autonomous execution for cardiac care, addressing prompt-based role assignment, rigid workflows, static knowledge, and unimodal inputs, with efficiency gains across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cardiovascular diseases are the leading global cause of death and are worsened by a shortage of healthcare workers. There is a need for AI that can adaptively plan, interpret cases with clinicians, and operate with external tools. Current systems rely on fixed roles, linear workflows, static knowledge bases, and limited modalities, hindering real-world clinical utility.

Method: Propose CardAIc-Agents: CardiacRAG agent generates general plans from updatable cardiac knowledge; a chief agent integrates tools to autonomously execute plans and deliver decisions; a stepwise update strategy dynamically refines plans based on prior execution results for complex tasks; a multidisciplinary discussion tool interprets challenging cases; visual review panels assist clinician validation.

Result: Experiments across three datasets show CardAIc-Agents outperform mainstream Vision-Language Models, state-of-the-art agentic systems, and fine-tuned VLMs in efficiency.

Conclusion: CardAIc-Agents provide adaptive, tool-augmented support for diverse cardiac tasks, enabling dynamic planning, autonomous execution, and collaborative interpretation with clinicians, addressing key limitations of current AI systems in cardiology.

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain the foremost cause of mortality
worldwide, a burden worsened by a severe deficit of healthcare workers.
Artificial intelligence (AI) agents have shown potential to alleviate this gap
via automated early detection and proactive screening, yet their clinical
application remains limited by: 1) prompt-based clinical role assignment that
relies on intrinsic model capabilities without domain-specific tool support; or
2) rigid sequential workflows, whereas clinical care often requires adaptive
reasoning that orders specific tests and, based on their results, guides
personalised next steps; 3) general and static knowledge bases without
continuous learning capability; and 4) fixed unimodal or bimodal inputs and
lack of on-demand visual outputs when further clarification is needed. In
response, a multimodal framework, CardAIc-Agents, was proposed to augment
models with external tools and adaptively support diverse cardiac tasks.
Specifically, a CardiacRAG agent generated general plans from updatable cardiac
knowledge, while the chief agent integrated tools to autonomously execute these
plans and deliver decisions. To enable adaptive and case-specific
customization, a stepwise update strategy was proposed to dynamically refine
plans based on preceding execution results, once the task was assessed as
complex. In addition, a multidisciplinary discussion tool was introduced to
interpret challenging cases, thereby supporting further adaptation. When
clinicians raised concerns, visual review panels were provided to assist final
validation. Experiments across three datasets showed the efficiency of
CardAIc-Agents compared to mainstream Vision-Language Models (VLMs),
state-of-the-art agentic systems, and fine-tuned VLMs.

Motivation: To overcome limitations of analyzing numerical signals or textual data in isolation, by leveraging multimodal signals (numerical and sentiment-rich news) to improve daily stock-movement forecasting.

Method: A multimodal pipeline that encodes numerical features and sentiment-enriched news text into embeddings, then fuses them through feature concatenation and cross-modal attention. The approach includes a unified pipeline with multiple fusion strategies and model configurations, evaluated via backtesting.

Result: STS (STONK) outperforms numeric-only baselines in backtests; comprehensive evaluation provides evidence-based guidance for choosing fusion strategies and model configurations for scalable multimodal financial forecasting.

Conclusion: Multimodal fusion of numerical indicators and sentiment-enriched news improves daily stock-movement prediction and offers actionable guidance for model design and configuration; source code is available on GitHub.

Abstract: We propose STONK (Stock Optimization using News Knowledge), a multimodal
framework integrating numerical market indicators with sentiment-enriched news
embeddings to improve daily stock-movement prediction. By combining numerical &
textual embeddings via feature concatenation and cross-modal attention, our
unified pipeline addresses limitations of isolated analyses. Backtesting shows
STONK outperforms numeric-only baselines. A comprehensive evaluation of fusion
strategies and model configurations offers evidence-based guidance for scalable

### [173] [HiFo-Prompt: Prompting with Hindsight and Foresight for LLM-based Automatic Heuristic Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13333)
*Chentong Chen,Mengyuan Zhong,Jianyong Sun,Ye Fan,Jialong Shi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HiFo-Prompt pairs foresight- and hindsight-based prompting to guide LLMs in evolutionary computation, creating a persistent knowledge base that improves heuristic quality, convergence speed, and query efficiency over prior LLM-based AHD methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: to overcome static operators and lack of knowledge accumulation in LLM-driven automatic heuristic design within EC.

Method: introduce HiFo-Prompt with two synergistic prompting strategies: Foresight prompts adaptively steer search based on population dynamics to balance exploration-exploitation; Hindsight prompts distill successful heuristics from past generations into reusable design principles, forming a persistent knowledge base.

Result: empirical results show HiFo-Prompt significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based AHD methods, yielding higher-quality heuristics, faster convergence, and better query efficiency.

Conclusion: the dual mechanism transforms transient discoveries into persistent knowledge, enabling the LLM to learn from experience and improving LHD performance in EC.

Abstract: LLM-based Automatic Heuristic Design (AHD) within Evolutionary Computation
(EC) frameworks has shown promising results. However, its effectiveness is
hindered by the use of static operators and the lack of knowledge accumulation
mechanisms. We introduce HiFo-Prompt, a framework that guides LLMs with two
synergistic prompting strategies: Foresight and Hindsight. Foresight-based
prompts adaptively steer the search based on population dynamics, managing the
exploration-exploitation trade-off. In addition, hindsight-based prompts mimic
human expertise by distilling successful heuristics from past generations into
fundamental, reusable design principles. This dual mechanism transforms
transient discoveries into a persistent knowledge base, enabling the LLM to
learn from its own experience. Empirical results demonstrate that HiFo-Prompt
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based AHD methods, generating
higher-quality heuristics while achieving substantially faster convergence and
superior query efficiency.

### [174] [LOOP: A Plug-and-Play Neuro-Symbolic Framework for Enhancing Planning in Autonomous Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13371)
*Ronit Virwani,Ruchika Suryawanshi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR:  LOOP is a neuro-symbolic planning framework that treats planning as an iterative dialogue between neural and symbolic components, generating and refining PDDL plans and building a causal knowledge base, achieving high success on IPC benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address reliability gaps in autonomous planning by combining the flexibility of neural methods with the guarantees of symbolic reasoning; current neural planners yield missing preconditions, inconsistent goals, or hallucinations, while classical planners are rigid and lack natural language understanding.

Method:  LOOP employs 13 coordinated neural features, including graph neural networks for spatial relations, multi-agent validation for consensus-based correctness, hierarchical decomposition for complex tasks, and causal memory that learns from successes and failures. It generates PDDL specifications, iteratively refines them using symbolic feedback, and constructs a causal knowledge base from execution traces.

Result: Evaluated on six standard IPC benchmark domains, LOOP achieved an 85.8% success rate, outperforming LLM+P (55.0%), LLM-as-Planner (19.2%), and Tree-of-Thoughts (3.3%).

Conclusion: Trustworthy planning requires neural and symbolic components to actively communicate throughout the process; LOOP offers a blueprint for building autonomous systems that can be trusted in real-world, high-stakes tasks.

Abstract: Planning is one of the most critical tasks in autonomous systems, where even
a small error can lead to major failures or million-dollar losses. Current
state-of-the-art neural planning approaches struggle with complex domains,
producing plans with missing preconditions, inconsistent goals, and
hallucinations. While classical planners provide logical guarantees, they lack
the flexibility and natural language understanding capabilities needed for
modern autonomous systems. Existing neuro-symbolic approaches use one-shot
translation from natural language to formal plans, missing the opportunity for
neural and symbolic components to work and refine solutions together. To
address this gap, we develop LOOP -- a novel neuro-symbolic planning framework
that treats planning as an iterative conversation between neural and symbolic
components rather than simple translation. LOOP integrates 13 coordinated
neural features including graph neural networks for spatial relationships,
multi-agent validation for consensus-based correctness, hierarchical
decomposition for complex task management, and causal memory that learns from
both successes and failures. Unlike existing approaches, LOOP generates PDDL
specifications, refines them iteratively based on symbolic feedback, and builds
a causal knowledge base from execution traces. LOOP was evaluated on six
standard IPC benchmark domains, where it achieved 85.8% success rate compared
to LLM+P (55.0%), LLM-as-Planner (19.2%), and Tree-of-Thoughts (3.3%). This
work shows that the key to reliable planning is not in choosing between neural
networks or symbolic reasoners but it lies in making them actually ``talk'' to
each other during the entire process. LOOP provides a thorough blueprint for
building autonomous systems that can finally be trusted with critical
real-world applications.

### [175] [SPANER: Shared Prompt Aligner for Multimodal Semantic Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13387)
*Thye Shan Ng,Caren Soyeon Han,Eun-Jung Holden*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SPANER proposes a modality-agnostic PEFT framework that uses a shared prompt as a conceptual anchor to embed inputs from diverse modalities into a unified semantic space, enabling cross-modal generalisation and extensibility to additional modalities like audio, with competitive few-shot retrieval performance and strong semantic coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal PEFT methods improve task-specific metrics but often keep modality-specific representations isolated, hindering cross-modal generalisation. There is a need to align embedding structures across modalities rather than solely tuning adapters.

Method: Introduce SPANER, a shared prompt mechanism that serves as a common anchor to map inputs from different modalities into a single semantic space. The design is extensible to add more modalities without changing the core architecture, enabling cross-modal alignment through a modality-agnostic adapter/prompts framework.

Result: SPANER achieves competitive few-shot retrieval on vision-language and audio-visual benchmarks while maintaining high semantic coherence in the embedding space, underscoring the value of embedding-structure alignment for scalable multimodal learning.

Conclusion: Aligning embedding structures via a shared prompt is advantageous for scalable multimodal learning, and SPANER demonstrates how modality-agnostic prompts can facilitate cross-modal generalisation and easy integration of new modalities.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) have
significantly improved performance on downstream tasks such as few-shot
retrieval. However, most existing approaches focus on task-specific gains while
neglecting the structure of the multimodal embedding space. As a result,
modality-specific representations often remain isolated, limiting cross-modal
generalisation. In this work, we introduce Shared Prompt AligNER (SPANER), a
modality-agnostic PEFT framework designed to embed inputs from diverse
modalities into a unified semantic space. At its core, SPANER employs a shared
prompt mechanism that acts as a conceptual anchor, enabling semantically
related instances to converge spatially regardless of modality. This shared
prompt design is inherently extensible, supporting the seamless integration of
additional modalities, such as audio, without altering the core architecture.
Through comprehensive experiments across vision-language and audio-visual
benchmarks, SPANER demonstrates competitive few-shot retrieval performance
while preserving high semantic coherence in the learned embedding space. Our
results highlight the importance of aligning embedding structures, rather than
merely tuning adapter weights, for scalable multimodal learning.

### [176] [TASER: Table Agents for Schema-guided Extraction and Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13404)
*Nicole Cho,Kirsty Fielding,William Watson,Sumitra Ganesh,Manuela Veloso*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A continuous-learning, agentic system (TASER) for extracting multi-page, heterogeneous financial tables into schema-conforming outputs, outperforming baselines and enabling a new real-world financial table dataset (TASERTab); continuous learning boosts actionable schema recommendations and holdings extraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world financial documents contain vast, diverse tables that are messy and multi-page, making accurate extraction challenging; there is a scarcity of real-world financial table datasets to evaluate robust extraction systems.

Method: TASER comprises agents for table detection, classification, extraction, and recommendations guided by an initial schema. A Recommender Agent reviews outputs, suggests schema revisions, and makes final recommendations. The system emphasizes continuous learning, with larger batch sizes increasing actionable schema recommendations. Training data includes manually labeled pages (22,584), tables (3,213), and holdings (≈$7.32e11). The dataset TASERTab is released.

Result: TASER outperforms Table Transformer by 10.1% on the considered task. In the continuous-learning setup, larger batch sizes yield a 104.3% increase in actionable schema recommendations and a 9.8% rise in extracted holdings.

Conclusion: Agentic, schema-guided extraction is promising for robust understanding of real-world financial tables; TASER demonstrates effective multi-page table extraction and validates releasing TASERTab as a valuable resource for the research community.

Abstract: Real-world financial documents report essential information about an entity's
financial holdings that can span millions of different financial instrument
types. Yet, these details are often buried in messy, multi-page, fragmented
tables - for example, 99.4% of the tables in our dataset have no bounding boxes
with the maximum number of rows amounting to 426 per table across 44 pages. To
tackle these unique challenges from real-world tables, we present a
continuously learning, agentic table extraction system, TASER (Table Agents for
Schema-guided Extraction and Recommendation) that extracts highly unstructured,
multi-page, heterogeneous tables into normalized, schema-conforming outputs.
Our table agents execute on table detection, classification, extraction, and
recommendations by leveraging an initial schema. Then, our Recommender Agent
reviews the outputs, recommends schema revisions, and decides on the final
recommendations, enabling TASER to outperform existing table detection models
such as Table Transformer by 10.1%. Within this continuous learning process, we
highlight that larger batch sizes result in a 104.3% increase in schema
recommendations that are actionable and utilized, resulting in a 9.8% increase
in extracted holdings - highlighting the importance of a continuous learning
process. To train TASER, we have manually labeled 22,584 pages (28,150,449
tokens), 3,213 tables for $731,685,511,687 of holdings culminating in one of
the first real financial table datasets. We release our dataset TASERTab to
enable the research community to access real-world financial tables and
outputs. Our results highlight the promise of agentic, schema-guided extraction
systems for robust understanding of real-world financial tables.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An agentic, domain-agnostic AI system autonomously conducts the full scientific workflow—from hypothesis generation to manuscript—across experiments, data collection, and analysis, demonstrating capabilities comparable to experienced researchers but with limitations in conceptual nuance; marks progress toward embodied AI in science and raises questions about scientific understanding and credit.

Motivation: The exponential growth of scientific literature and increasing domain specialization constrain cross-disciplinary synthesis and theory formation, motivating exploration of general-purpose AI systems to accelerate discovery and unify scientific understanding.

Method: A domain-agnostic, agentic AI system independently navigates the scientific workflow: generating hypotheses, designing and executing studies, collecting data (three psychology experiments on visual working memory, mental rotation, and imagery vividness), conducting a new online data collection with 288 participants, developing analysis pipelines through long coding sessions, and producing manuscripts.

Result: The AI demonstrated non-trivial research capability with theoretical reasoning and methodological rigor comparable to experienced researchers, completing three studies and one new data collection, building analysis pipelines, and producing manuscripts; it operates autonomously but shows limitations in conceptual nuance and theoretical interpretation.

Conclusion: This work advances embodied AI for science by enabling autonomous hypothesis testing and experimentation to accelerate discovery, while highlighting ongoing questions about the nature of scientific understanding and how credit is attributed for AI-driven research.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence systems are transforming scientific discovery by
accelerating specific research tasks, from protein structure prediction to
materials design, yet remain confined to narrow domains requiring substantial
human oversight. The exponential growth of scientific literature and increasing
domain specialisation constrain researchers' capacity to synthesise knowledge
across disciplines and develop unifying theories, motivating exploration of
more general-purpose AI systems for science. Here we show that a
domain-agnostic, agentic AI system can independently navigate the scientific
workflow - from hypothesis generation through data collection to manuscript
preparation. The system autonomously designed and executed three psychological
studies on visual working memory, mental rotation, and imagery vividness,
executed one new online data collection with 288 participants, developed
analysis pipelines through 8-hour+ continuous coding sessions, and produced
completed manuscripts. The results demonstrate the capability of AI scientific
discovery pipelines to conduct non-trivial research with theoretical reasoning
and methodological rigour comparable to experienced researchers, though with
limitations in conceptual nuance and theoretical interpretation. This is a step
toward embodied AI that can test hypotheses through real-world experiments,
accelerating discovery by autonomously exploring regions of scientific space
that human cognitive and resource constraints might otherwise leave unexplored.
It raises important questions about the nature of scientific understanding and
the attribution of scientific credit.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers excel at global modeling but struggle with rigid temporal encoding and weak space-time fusion in traffic forecasting. The problem requires capturing complex temporal patterns, dynamic spatial structures, and diverse input formats, motivating a unified, interpretable representation learning approach.

Method: STPFormer integrates four modules: Temporal Position Aggregator (TPA) for pattern-aware temporal encoding, Spatial Sequence Aggregator (SSA) for sequential spatial learning, Spatial-Temporal Graph Matching (STGM) for cross-domain alignment, and an Attention Mixer for multi-scale fusion, enabling unified spatio-temporal representation learning.

Result: On five real-world datasets STPFormer consistently achieves state-of-the-art results. Ablation studies and visualizations confirm the contributions of each module and demonstrate the model's effectiveness and generalizability.

Conclusion: STPFormer demonstrates that a unified, pattern-aware spatio-temporal transformer with dedicated modules for temporal encoding, spatial sequencing, cross-domain alignment, and fusion can achieve superior, interpretable performance in traffic forecasting and generalize across datasets.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal traffic forecasting is challenging due to complex temporal
patterns, dynamic spatial structures, and diverse input formats. Although
Transformer-based models offer strong global modeling, they often struggle with
rigid temporal encoding and weak space-time fusion. We propose STPFormer, a
Spatio-Temporal Pattern-Aware Transformer that achieves state-of-the-art
performance via unified and interpretable representation learning. It
integrates four modules: Temporal Position Aggregator (TPA) for pattern-aware
temporal encoding, Spatial Sequence Aggregator (SSA) for sequential spatial
learning, Spatial-Temporal Graph Matching (STGM) for cross-domain alignment,
and an Attention Mixer for multi-scale fusion. Experiments on five real-world

### [179] [Discrete Optimization of Min-Max Violation and its Applications Across Computational Sciences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13437)
*Cheikh Ahmed,Mahdi Mostajabdaveh,Samin Aref,Zirui Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Discrete Min-Max Violation (DMMV) is a general discrete optimization problem that minimizes the worst (maximum) constraint violation. The authors develop a GPU-accelerated heuristic and validate it on three use cases—post-training quantization of language models, discrete tomography, and FIR filter design—showing notable improvements and speedups, and they plan to release open-source code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many optimization tasks require guaranteeing worst-case performance under discrete decisions. DMMV provides a context-free, broadly applicable formulation. To handle practically large instances, a GPU-accelerated heuristic is proposed, with demonstrations across diverse applications to illustrate its versatility and potential performance gains.

Method: Define DMMV mathematically, analyze its structural properties, and design a GPU-accelerated heuristic that leverages these properties to efficiently search for assignments minimizing the maximum constraint violation. Apply the approach to three use cases (post-training quantization, discrete tomography, FIR filter design) and compare against relevant baselines; provide open-source code.

Result: Quantization (without outlier separation): ~14% average improvement over existing methods. Discrete tomography: ~16% reduction in reconstruction error under uniform noise and ~6× GPU speedup. FIR filter design: ~50% ripple reduction compared to Gurobi. These results illustrate the method’s effectiveness and versatility across domains.

Conclusion: DMMV is a practical, context-free optimization framework. The GPU-accelerated heuristic offers significant benefits across diverse problems, with substantial performance and quality gains. The authors will release open-source code to foster further research and broader adoption.

Abstract: We introduce the Discrete Min-Max Violation (DMMV) as a general optimization
problem which seeks an assignment of discrete values to variables that
minimizes the largest constraint violation. This context-free mathematical
formulation is applicable to a wide range of use cases that have worst-case
performance requirements. After defining the DMMV problem mathematically, we
explore its properties to establish a foundational understanding. To tackle
DMMV instance sizes of practical relevance, we develop a GPU-accelerated
heuristic that takes advantage of the mathematical properties of DMMV for
speeding up the solution process. We demonstrate the versatile applicability of
our heuristic by solving three optimization problems as use cases: (1)
post-training quantization of language models, (2) discrete tomography, and (3)
Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter design. In quantization without outlier
separation, our heuristic achieves 14% improvement on average over existing
methods. In discrete tomography, it reduces reconstruction error by 16% under
uniform noise and accelerates computations by a factor of 6 on GPU. For FIR
filter design, it nearly achieves 50% ripple reduction compared to using the
commercial integer optimization solver, Gurobi. Our comparative results point
to the benefits of studying DMMV as a context-free optimization problem and the
advantages that our proposed heuristic offers on three distinct problems. Our
GPU-accelerated heuristic will be made open-source to further stimulate
research on DMMV and its other applications. The code is available at

*Yuzhi Tang,Tianxiao Li,Elizabeth Li,Chris J. Maddison,Honghua Dong,Yangjun Ruan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LM agents show a risk-awareness vs safety-execution gap: they often know risks but fail to identify or avoid them in practice. The authors propose a three-dimensional evaluation (risk knowledge, risk identification in execution trajectories, and risk-avoidant behavior) and, to mitigate gaps, design a risk verifier that critiques actions and an abstractor that converts trajectories into abstract descriptions. The system reduces risky actions by 55.3% compared with vanilla prompting, with results spanning general LMs and specialized models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety in LM agents is not solved by scaling; there is a notable gap between risk knowledge and actual safe behavior. A systematic evaluation is needed to reveal this gap and to develop protective mechanisms beyond mere model capability improvement.

Method: Three-stage evaluation: (1) assess knowledge of potential risks (nearly perfect, >98% pass); (2) identify risks in execution trajectories (drop >23% in performance); (3) actual risk-avoidant behavior (pass <26%). Found across capable LMs and specialized reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1. Based on these gaps, develop a risk verifier that independently critiques proposed actions and an abstractor that converts trajectories into abstract descriptions to improve risk detection.

Result: Despite high risk knowledge, agents struggle to identify risks in real scenarios and may execute risky actions. The proposed verifier/abstractor framework yields a 55.3% reduction in risky action execution relative to vanilla prompts, and the effect persists across different model types.

Conclusion: Simply scaling model size or computation does not inherently resolve safety concerns. The observed generator-validator gap motivates architectural safeguards (risk verifier and trajectory abstraction) to mitigate risky behaviors in LM agents, offering a practical mitigation strategy with demonstrated efficacy.

Abstract: Language model (LM) agents have demonstrated significant potential for
automating real-world tasks, yet they pose a diverse array of potential, severe
risks in safety-critical scenarios. In this work, we identify a significant gap
between LM agents' risk awareness and safety execution abilities: while they
often answer "Yes" to queries like "Is executing `sudo rm -rf /*' dangerous?",
they will likely fail to identify such risks in instantiated trajectories or
even directly perform these risky actions when acting as agents. To
systematically investigate this, we develop a comprehensive evaluation
framework to examine agents' safety across three progressive dimensions: 1)
their knowledge about potential risks, 2) their ability to identify
corresponding risks in execution trajectories, and 3) their actual behaviors to
avoid executing these risky actions. Our evaluation reveals two critical
performance gaps that resemble the generator-validator gaps observed in LMs:
while agents demonstrate near-perfect risk knowledge ($>98\%$ pass rates), they
fail to apply this knowledge when identifying risks in actual scenarios (with
performance dropping by $>23\%$) and often still execute risky actions ($<26\%$
pass rates). Notably, this trend persists across more capable LMs as well as in
specialized reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1, indicating that simply scaling
model capabilities or inference compute does not inherently resolve safety
concerns. Instead, we take advantage of these observed gaps to develop a risk
verifier that independently critiques the proposed actions by agents, with an
abstractor that converts specific execution trajectories into abstract
descriptions where LMs can more effectively identify the risks. Our overall
system achieves a significant reduction of risky action execution by $55.3\%$
over vanilla-prompted agents.

### [181] [CrafterDojo: A Suite of Foundation Models for Building Open-Ended Embodied Agents in Crafter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13530)
*Junyeong Park,Hyeonseo Cho,Sungjin Ahn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CrafterDojo introduces a suite of foundation models and tools to turn the Crafter environment into a lightweight, prototyping-friendly Minecraft-like testbed for general-purpose embodied agents. It includes CrafterVPT, CrafterCLIP, CrafterSteve-1, dataset tools CrafterPlay and CrafterCaption, reference agents, benchmarks, and an open-source codebase.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing general-purpose embodied agents remains hard, and while Minecraft offers rich data and complexity, its speed and engineering overhead hinder rapid prototyping. Crafter is a lighter alternative, but lacked foundation models and tooling. CrafterDojo aims to bridge this gap by providing foundation models and data/tools to enable rapid research in Crafter.

Method: Develop and integrate a suite of foundation models for behavior priors (CrafterVPT), vision-language grounding (CrafterCLIP), and instruction following (CrafterSteve-1); provide datasets for behavior (CrafterPlay) and captions (CrafterCaption); deliver reference agent implementations, benchmarks, and an open-source codebase to facilitate experimentation in Crafter.

Result: Proposes CrafterDojo as a lightweight, prototyping-friendly Minecraft-like testbed for embodied AI research, backed by models, datasets, reference agents, benchmarks, and an open-source codebase.

Conclusion: CrafterDojo provides a foundational platform that lowers barriers to rapid prototyping of embodied agents in Crafter, leveraging foundation-model-style components and open resources to accelerate research in Minecraft-like environments.

Abstract: Developing general-purpose embodied agents is a core challenge in AI.
Minecraft provides rich complexity and internet-scale data, but its slow speed
and engineering overhead make it unsuitable for rapid prototyping. Crafter
offers a lightweight alternative that retains key challenges from Minecraft,
yet its use has remained limited to narrow tasks due to the absence of
foundation models that have driven progress in the Minecraft setting. In this
paper, we present CrafterDojo, a suite of foundation models and tools that
unlock the Crafter environment as a lightweight, prototyping-friendly, and
Minecraft-like testbed for general-purpose embodied agent research. CrafterDojo
addresses this by introducing CrafterVPT, CrafterCLIP, and CrafterSteve-1 for
behavior priors, vision-language grounding, and instruction following,
respectively. In addition, we provide toolkits for generating behavior and
caption datasets (CrafterPlay and CrafterCaption), reference agent
implementations, benchmark evaluations, and a complete open-source codebase.

### [182] [Toward Better EHR Reasoning in LLMs: Reinforcement Learning with Expert Attention Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13579)
*Yue Fang,Yuxin Guo,Jiaran Gao,Hongxin Ding,Xinke Jiang,Weibin Liao,Yongxin Xu,Yinghao Zhu,Zhibang Yang,Liantao Ma,Junfeng Zhao,Yasha Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EAG-RL improves LLMs' EHR reasoning via expert-guided trajectories and attention alignment, achieving ~14.6% intrinsic improvement and better robustness/generalization; code available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with temporally structured, high-dimensional EHR data and existing approaches rely on DL models downstream, not improving intrinsic LLM reasoning; need intrinsic enhancement of LLMs for clinical prediction.

Method: Two-stage approach: (1) construct high-quality stepwise reasoning trajectories using expert-guided Monte Carlo Tree Search to initialize the LLM's policy; (2) fine-tune via reinforcement learning to align the LLM's attention with clinically salient features identified by expert EHR models.

Result: Experiments on two real-world EHR datasets show an average 14.62% improvement in intrinsic EHR reasoning, with improved robustness to feature perturbations and better generalization to unseen clinical domains.

Conclusion: EAG-RL demonstrates the practical potential of intrinsically enhancing LLMs for EHR reasoning; code available at GitHub for reproducibility; supports deployment in clinical predictive tasks.

Abstract: Improving large language models (LLMs) for electronic health record (EHR)
reasoning is essential for enabling accurate and generalizable clinical
predictions. While LLMs excel at medical text understanding, they underperform
on EHR-based prediction tasks due to challenges in modeling temporally
structured, high-dimensional data. Existing approaches often rely on hybrid
paradigms, where LLMs serve merely as frozen prior retrievers while downstream
deep learning (DL) models handle prediction, failing to improve the LLM's
intrinsic reasoning capacity and inheriting the generalization limitations of
DL models. To this end, we propose EAG-RL, a novel two-stage training framework
designed to intrinsically enhance LLMs' EHR reasoning ability through expert
attention guidance, where expert EHR models refer to task-specific DL models
trained on EHR data. Concretely, EAG-RL first constructs high-quality, stepwise
reasoning trajectories using expert-guided Monte Carlo Tree Search to
effectively initialize the LLM's policy. Then, EAG-RL further optimizes the
policy via reinforcement learning by aligning the LLM's attention with
clinically salient features identified by expert EHR models. Extensive
experiments on two real-world EHR datasets show that EAG-RL improves the
intrinsic EHR reasoning ability of LLMs by an average of 14.62%, while also
enhancing robustness to feature perturbations and generalization to unseen
clinical domains. These results demonstrate the practical potential of EAG-RL
for real-world deployment in clinical prediction tasks. Our code have been
available at https://github.com/devilran6/EAG-RL.

### [183] [Breaking the SFT Plateau: Multimodal Structured Reinforcement Learning for Chart-to-Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13587)
*Lei Chen,Xuanle Zhao,Zhixiong Zeng,Jing Huang,Liming Zheng,Yufeng Zhong,Lin Ma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MSRL introduces multimodal structured reinforcement learning to break the SFT plateau in chart-to-code generation, achieving large gains with a 3M-chart-code corpus and a two-stage curriculum.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SFT optimization plateaus for tasks requiring deep understanding and structured outputs; need reinforcement learning with multimodal, structured rewards to guide generation.

Method: Train with Multimodal Structured RL (MSRL) using a two-stage curriculum; incorporate textual rule-based rewards validating code details; and visual rewards by rendering generated code to images and evaluating with a model-based evaluator; train on a 3 million chart-code corpus derived from arXiv tables.

Result: MSRL substantially surpasses SFT plateau, with high-level metric gains of 6.2% on ChartMimic and 9.9% on ReachQA; performs competitively with advanced closed-source models.

Conclusion: Multimodal structured rewards plus a curriculum-based training approach effectively enhances chart-to-code generation beyond SFT, highlighting the value of combining textual and visual feedback for structured-output tasks.

Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) has proven highly effective for general
reasoning in vision-language models, its application to tasks requiring
in-depth understanding of information-rich images and generation of structured
outputs remains underexplored. Chart-to-code generation exemplifies this
challenge, demanding complex reasoning over visual charts to generate
structured code. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) alone is often insufficient,
highlighting the need for effective RL strategies that appropriately reward
structured outputs. We systematically investigate the performance plateau in
SFT through large-scale experiments and propose Multimodal Structured
Reinforcement Learning (MSRL) for chart-to-code generation, which substantially
breaks through this plateau. We construct the largest training corpus to date,
containing 3 million chart-code pairs from real-world arXiv tables to mitigate
simplistic patterns of prior synthetic data. Despite reaching state-of-the-art
performance, our experiments show that scaling SFT data eventually hits a
plateau where further increases yield negligible improvements. Our MSRL method
leverages a multi-granularity structured reward system using multimodal textual
and visual feedback. At the textual level, rule-based rewards validate
fine-grained code details. At the visual level, model-based rewards assess
structural similarity by rendering generated code into images and employing an
evaluator model. We implement this within a two-stage curriculum for training
stability. Results demonstrate that MSRL significantly breaks the SFT plateau,
improving high-level metrics by 6.2% and 9.9% on ChartMimic and ReachQA
benchmarks respectively, achieving competitive performance with advanced
closed-source models.

### [184] [V2P: From Background Suppression to Center Peaking for Robust GUI Grounding Task](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13634)
*Jikai Chen,Long Chen,Dong Wang,Leilei Gan,Chenyi Zhuang,Jinjie Gu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: V2P introduces suppression attention and Gaussian center-edge weighting to achieve precise GUI grounding, addressing background distraction and center-edge ambiguity. It achieves 92.3% on ScreenSpot-v2 and 50.5% on ScreenSpot-Pro, with ablations confirming component benefits and generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GUI grounding methods rely on bounding boxes or center-point regression and often ignore spatial uncertainty and visual-semantic hierarchies. Attention-based approaches still suffer from background distraction (attention drift) and uniform labeling that blurs center vs. edges, leading to imprecise clicks.

Method: Introduce suppression attention to reduce focus on irrelevant regions, and model GUI interactions as 2D Gaussian heatmaps (inspired by Fitts' Law) where weights decay from the center toward the edges. The Gaussian variance scales with the target size, guiding the model to emphasize the central, essential point of the UI element.

Result: Empirically, the method attains 92.3% on ScreenSpot-v2 and 50.5% on ScreenSpot-Pro. Ablation studies validate the contribution of each component, and the approach shows generalizability for precise GUI grounding tasks.

Conclusion: V2P effectively isolates the target area and instructs the model to concentrate on the most critical point, yielding precise GUI grounding and strong generalizability to related GUI interaction tasks.

Abstract: Precise localization of GUI elements is crucial for the development of GUI
agents. Traditional methods rely on bounding box or center-point regression,
neglecting spatial interaction uncertainty and visual-semantic hierarchies.
Recent methods incorporate attention mechanisms but still face two key issues:
(1) ignoring processing background regions causes attention drift from the
desired area, and (2) uniform labeling fails to distinguish between center and
edges of the target UI element, leading to click imprecision. Inspired by how
humans visually process and interact with GUI elements, we propose the
Valley-to-Peak (V2P) method to address these issues. To mitigate background
distractions, V2P introduces a suppression attention mechanism that minimizes
the model's focus on irrelevant regions to highlight the intended region. For
the issue of center-edge distinction, V2P applies a Fitts' Law-inspired
approach by modeling GUI interactions as 2D Gaussian heatmaps where the weight
gradually decreases from the center towards the edges. The weight distribution
follows a Gaussian function, with the variance determined by the target's size.
Consequently, V2P effectively isolates the target area and teaches the model to
concentrate on the most essential point of the UI element. The model trained by
V2P achieves the performance with 92.3% and 50.5% on two benchmarks
ScreenSpot-v2 and ScreenSpot-Pro. Ablations further confirm each component's
contribution, highlighting V2P's generalizability for precise GUI grounding
tasks.

### [185] [Interactive Query Answering on Knowledge Graphs with Soft Entity Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13663)
*Daniel Daza,Alberto Bernardi,Luca Costabello,Christophe Gueret,Masoud Mansoury,Michael Cochez,Martijn Schut*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces Neural Query Reranker (NQR) to handle soft constraints in query answering over incomplete knowledge graphs. It is interactive, using incremental feedback, and extends benchmarks with soft constraints; maintains robust QA performance while capturing soft preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world queries often involve vague or context-dependent constraints (soft preferences), which are not well-supported by existing hard-logic QA methods over incomplete KGs.

Method: A Neural Query Reranker (NQR) that re-scores candidate answers by incorporating soft constraints without altering the base answer set. It operates interactively, refining results via incremental examples of preferred and non-preferred entities, and this approach is evaluated on extended QA benchmarks augmented with soft-constraint data.

Result: Empirical results demonstrate that NQR can learn and apply soft constraints while preserving robust query answering performance on incomplete KGs.

Conclusion: Soft constraints can be effectively integrated into query answering over incomplete KGs through an interactive neural reranking framework, with extended benchmarks and promising empirical outcomes.

Abstract: Methods for query answering over incomplete knowledge graphs retrieve
entities that are likely to be answers, which is particularly useful when such
answers cannot be reached by direct graph traversal due to missing edges.
However, existing approaches have focused on queries formalized using
first-order-logic. In practice, many real-world queries involve constraints
that are inherently vague or context-dependent, such as preferences for
attributes or related categories. Addressing this gap, we introduce the problem
of query answering with soft constraints. We propose a Neural Query Reranker
(NQR) designed to adjust query answer scores by incorporating soft constraints
without disrupting the original answers to a query. NQR operates interactively,
refining answers based on incremental examples of preferred and non-preferred
entities. We extend existing QA benchmarks by generating datasets with soft
constraints. Our experiments demonstrate that NQR can capture soft constraints
while maintaining robust query answering performance.

### [186] [ITL-LIME: Instance-Based Transfer Learning for Enhancing Local Explanations in Low-Resource Data Settings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13672)
*Rehan Raza,Guanjin Wang,Kevin Wong,Hamid Laga,Marco Fisichella*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ITL-LIME is a transfer-learning extension of LIME that uses real source-domain instances and a contrastive encoder to weight local samples, replacing random perturbations to improve explanation fidelity and stability in data-scarce settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LIME's randomness in perturbation and sampling can cause locality and instability, especially with limited data, leading to surrogate models that poorly approximate the original decision boundary. The work seeks a data-efficient, stable explanation method via instance transfer learning.

Method: Cluster the source domain to identify prototypes. For a target instance, retrieve real source instances from the cluster whose prototype is most similar to the target. Combine these with the target's real neighbors. Use a contrastive-learning–based encoder to weight the combined instances by proximity to the target. Train the surrogate model with these weighted instances to generate explanations.

Result: The abstract claims improved explanation fidelity and stability in data-constrained settings but does not provide quantitative results or experiments within the abstract.

Conclusion: ITL-LIME integrates instance transfer learning into LIME to enable more faithful and stable local explanations under data scarcity by leveraging related real instances and a learned weighting mechanism.

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods, such as Local
Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), have advanced the
interpretability of black-box machine learning models by approximating their
behavior locally using interpretable surrogate models. However, LIME's inherent
randomness in perturbation and sampling can lead to locality and instability
issues, especially in scenarios with limited training data. In such cases, data
scarcity can result in the generation of unrealistic variations and samples
that deviate from the true data manifold. Consequently, the surrogate model may
fail to accurately approximate the complex decision boundary of the original
model. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Instance-based Transfer
Learning LIME framework (ITL-LIME) that enhances explanation fidelity and
stability in data-constrained environments. ITL-LIME introduces instance
transfer learning into the LIME framework by leveraging relevant real instances
from a related source domain to aid the explanation process in the target
domain. Specifically, we employ clustering to partition the source domain into
clusters with representative prototypes. Instead of generating random
perturbations, our method retrieves pertinent real source instances from the
source cluster whose prototype is most similar to the target instance. These
are then combined with the target instance's neighboring real instances. To
define a compact locality, we further construct a contrastive learning-based
encoder as a weighting mechanism to assign weights to the instances from the
combined set based on their proximity to the target instance. Finally, these
weighted source and target instances are used to train the surrogate model for
explanation purposes.

*Mariam Arustashvili,Jörg Deigmöller,Heiko Paulheim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Situational knowledge graphs from household actions reveal that standard link prediction methods underperform and do not surpass simple baselines, due to domain-specific characteristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve robot control and video analysis by completing incomplete household-action knowledge graphs, and to understand why traditional link prediction fails in this setting.

Method: The paper analyzes situational knowledge graphs and evaluates common link prediction algorithms against simple baselines, highlighting domain-specific characteristics that affect performance.

Result: Many link prediction algorithms are ill-suited for situational KGs and fail to outperform simple baselines, indicating a need for specialized approaches.

Conclusion: Existing LP methods are not adequate for situational knowledge graphs; progress requires developing algorithms tailored to the unique properties of these graphs.

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs are used for various purposes, including business
applications, biomedical analyses, or digital twins in industry 4.0. In this
paper, we investigate knowledge graphs describing household actions, which are
beneficial for controlling household robots and analyzing video footage. In the
latter case, the information extracted from videos is notoriously incomplete,
and completing the knowledge graph for enhancing the situational picture is
essential. In this paper, we show that, while a standard link prediction
problem, situational knowledge graphs have special characteristics that render
many link prediction algorithms not fit for the job, and unable to outperform
even simple baselines.

### [188] [MHSNet:An MoE-based Hierarchical Semantic Representation Network for Accurate Duplicate Resume Detection with Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13676)
*Yu Li,Zulong Chen,Wenjian Xu,Hong Wen,Yipeng Yu,Man Lung Yiu,Yuyu Yin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MHSNet is a multi-level identity verification framework that fine-tunes BGE-M3 with contrastive learning and uses a state-aware Mixture-of-Experts to produce multi-level representations for robust duplicate detection between fetched resumes and an internal talent pool.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Duplicated, incomplete, and heterogeneous resumes from third-party sources make accurate deduplication difficult. Effective duplication detection is essential to maintain and enrich a company’s talent pool.

Method: Fine-tune BGE-M3 using contrastive learning. Use a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) to generate multi-level sparse and dense representations of resumes, enabling multi-level semantic similarity computation. Employ a state-aware MoE to handle diverse incomplete resumes.

Result: Experimental results verify the effectiveness of MHSNet in performing multi-level duplicate detection between fetched and existing resumes, demonstrating improvements over baselines.

Conclusion: MHSNet provides robust, multi-level semantic representations and state-aware handling of incomplete resumes, enabling more accurate and scalable duplication detection to enrich the company's talent pool.

Abstract: To maintain the company's talent pool, recruiters need to continuously search
for resumes from third-party websites (e.g., LinkedIn, Indeed). However,
fetched resumes are often incomplete and inaccurate. To improve the quality of
third-party resumes and enrich the company's talent pool, it is essential to
conduct duplication detection between the fetched resumes and those already in
the company's talent pool. Such duplication detection is challenging due to the
semantic complexity, structural heterogeneity, and information incompleteness
of resume texts. To this end, we propose MHSNet, an multi-level identity
verification framework that fine-tunes BGE-M3 using contrastive learning. With
the fine-tuned , Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) generates multi-level sparse and
dense representations for resumes, enabling the computation of corresponding
multi-level semantic similarities. Moreover, the state-aware Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) is employed in MHSNet to handle diverse incomplete resumes. Experimental
results verify the effectiveness of MHSNet

*Vincent Derkinderen,Robin Manhaeve,Rik Adriaensen,Lucas Van Praet,Lennert De Smet,Giuseppe Marra,Luc De Raedt*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DeepLog presents a general neurosymbolic AI framework with a language layer and a GPU-accelerated computation layer, enabling abstract representation and execution of diverse neurosymbolic models across boolean, fuzzy, and probabilistic logics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a unified, declarative abstraction for neurosymbolic AI that can represent a wide range of models and enable systematic comparison across logics and integration choices, while achieving efficiency via GPU-based algebraic circuits.

Method: Two core components: (1) DeepLog language — an annotated neural extension of grounded first-order logic that abstracts over logic type (boolean, fuzzy, probabilistic) and whether logic is used in architecture or loss; (2) computational layer — extended algebraic circuits as computational graphs. Together form a neurosymbolic abstract machine with DeepLog as the intermediate level and circuits as the execution level. Implemented in software with GPU-optimized algebraic circuits; designed to be declarative so different neurosymbolic models can be built by changing underlying algebraic structures and logics. The authors validate by cross-comparing: (a) different fuzzy and probabilistic logics, (b) logic usage in architecture vs loss, (c) CPU-based vs GPU-based implementations.

Result: The work demonstrates the framework’s generality and efficiency, showing it's possible to represent and compare a variety of neurosymbolic setups and observe performance and capability differences across logics, usage modes, and hardware.

Conclusion: DeepLog provides a versatile neurosymbolic abstract machine that unifies model specification and efficient execution, enabling broad representational scope and systematic experimentation through its language and algebraic-circuit backend.

Abstract: We contribute a theoretical and operational framework for neurosymbolic AI
called DeepLog. DeepLog introduces building blocks and primitives for
neurosymbolic AI that make abstraction of commonly used representations and
computational mechanisms used in neurosymbolic AI. DeepLog can represent and
emulate a wide range of neurosymbolic systems. It consists of two key
components. The first is the DeepLog language for specifying neurosymbolic
models and inference tasks. This language consists of an annotated neural
extension of grounded first-order logic, and makes abstraction of the type of
logic, e.g. boolean, fuzzy or probabilistic, and whether logic is used in the
architecture or in the loss function. The second DeepLog component is situated
at the computational level and uses extended algebraic circuits as
computational graphs. Together these two components are to be considered as a
neurosymbolic abstract machine, with the DeepLog language as the intermediate
level of abstraction and the circuits level as the computational one. DeepLog
is implemented in software, relies on the latest insights in implementing
algebraic circuits on GPUs, and is declarative in that it is easy to obtain
different neurosymbolic models by making different choices for the underlying
algebraic structures and logics. The generality and efficiency of the DeepLog
neurosymbolic machine is demonstrated through an experimental comparison
between 1) different fuzzy and probabilistic logics, 2) between using logic in
the architecture or in the loss function, and 3) between a standalone CPU-based
implementation of a neurosymbolic AI system and a DeepLog GPU-based one.

### [191] [CausalPlan: Empowering Efficient LLM Multi-Agent Collaboration Through Causality-Driven Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13721)
*Minh Hoang Nguyen,Van Dai Do,Dung Nguyen,Thin Nguyen,Hung Le*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CausalPlan introduces a two-phase, causality-informed planning framework for multi-agent LLMs that learns a Structural Causal Action (SCA) graph from trajectories and uses causal scores to select or refine LLM proposals, improving coordination without fine-tuning; validated on Overcooked-AI across multiple models, showing fewer invalid actions and better collaboration than RL baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM agents, especially smaller open-source models, often produce causally invalid or incoherent actions due to relying on surface-level correlations rather than grounded causal reasoning, which hurts coordination and planning in dynamic environments.

Method: A two-phase framework where the Structural Causal Action (SCA) model learns a causal graph from agent trajectories to capture how prior actions and current environment states influence future decisions. This graph guides action selection by assigning causal scores to LLM-generated proposals, reweighting them or falling back to causally grounded alternatives. The approach embeds causal knowledge into the decision loop without fine-tuning the LLM and is evaluated across five multi-agent tasks and four LLMs (Gemma-7B, Llama-8B, Qwen-14B, Llama-70B).

Result: CausalPlan consistently reduces invalid actions and improves collaboration in both AI-AI and human-AI settings, outperforming strong reinforcement learning baselines.

Conclusion: Causality-driven planning can make multi-agent LLM systems more efficient, interpretable, and generalizable by constraining planning to intervention-consistent behaviours without requiring LLM fine-tuning.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents-especially smaller, open-source
models-often produce causally invalid or incoherent actions in collaborative
tasks due to their reliance on surface-level correlations rather than grounded
causal reasoning. This limitation undermines their performance in terms of
coordination and planning in dynamic environments. We address this challenge
with CausalPlan, a two-phase framework that integrates explicit structural
causal reasoning into the LLM planning process. At the core of CausalPlan is
the Structural Causal Action (SCA) model, which learns a causal graph from
agent trajectories to capture how prior actions and current environment states
influence future decisions. This structure is then used to guide action
selection by assigning causal scores to LLM-generated proposals, reweighting
them accordingly, or falling back to causally grounded alternatives when
needed. By embedding this causal knowledge directly into the decision loop,
CausalPlan constrains planning to intervention-consistent behaviours without
requiring fine-tuning of the LLM itself. We evaluate CausalPlan on the
Overcooked-AI benchmark across five multi-agent coordination tasks and four
LLMs of varying sizes: Gemma-7B, Llama-8B, Qwen-14B, and Llama-70B.
Experimental results show that CausalPlan consistently reduces invalid actions
and improves collaboration in both AI-AI and human-AI settings, outperforming
strong reinforcement learning baselines. Our findings highlight the value of
causality-driven planning for deploying efficient, interpretable, and
generalisable multi-agent LLM systems.

Motivation: Single-LLM approaches in medical decision-making are limited by static training data and fixed parametric knowledge, hindering robust integration of heterogeneous clinical information; there is a need for expert recruitment and multi-agent collaboration to improve reliability.

Method: Stage 1: build an LLM expertise table from public corpus mapping LLMs' strengths across medical departments and query difficulties, enabling dynamic selection of expert agents during inference. Stage 2: selected agents generate responses with self-assessed confidence scores; apply confidence fusion and adversarial validation to enhance diagnostic reliability.

Result: EMRC outperforms state-of-the-art single- and multi-LLM methods on three public MDM datasets; e.g., on MMLU-Pro-Health achieving 74.45% accuracy, 2.69% higher than GPT-4-0613.

Conclusion: Expertise-aware recruitment and collaborative multi-agent strategies improve diagnostic accuracy and reliability in medical decision-making, illustrating the value of agent complementarity and dynamic expert selection.

Abstract: Medical Decision-Making (MDM) is a complex process requiring substantial
domain-specific expertise to effectively synthesize heterogeneous and
complicated clinical information. While recent advancements in Large Language
Models (LLMs) show promise in supporting MDM, single-LLM approaches are limited
by their parametric knowledge constraints and static training corpora, failing
to robustly integrate the clinical information. To address this challenge, we
propose the Expertise-aware Multi-LLM Recruitment and Collaboration (EMRC)
framework to enhance the accuracy and reliability of MDM systems. It operates
in two stages: (i) expertise-aware agent recruitment and (ii) confidence- and
adversarial-driven multi-agent collaboration. Specifically, in the first stage,
we use a publicly available corpus to construct an LLM expertise table for
capturing expertise-specific strengths of multiple LLMs across medical
department categories and query difficulty levels. This table enables the
subsequent dynamic selection of the optimal LLMs to act as medical expert
agents for each medical query during the inference phase. In the second stage,
we employ selected agents to generate responses with self-assessed confidence
scores, which are then integrated through the confidence fusion and adversarial
validation to improve diagnostic reliability. We evaluate our EMRC framework on
three public MDM datasets, where the results demonstrate that our EMRC
outperforms state-of-the-art single- and multi-LLM methods, achieving superior
diagnostic performance. For instance, on the MMLU-Pro-Health dataset, our EMRC
achieves 74.45% accuracy, representing a 2.69% improvement over the
best-performing closed-source model GPT- 4-0613, which demonstrates the
effectiveness of our expertise-aware agent recruitment strategy and the agent
complementarity in leveraging each LLM's specialized capabilities.

### [193] [Quantifier Instantiations: To Mimic or To Revolt?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13811)
*Jan Jakubův,Mikoláš Janota*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A PCFG-based learning approach for quantifier instantiation in SMT that learns from past instantiations to generate new terms and can diversify by inverting probabilities to balance exploitation and exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantified formulas cause SMT undecidability challenges; existing instantiation techniques (e-matching, syntax-guided, model-based, conflict-based, enumerative) often complement each other. A learning-based instantiation strategy aims to unify and improve them by leveraging observed instantiations.

Method: Treat observed instantiations as samples from a latent language and use probabilistic context-free grammars to model term generation. Generate new terms from the learned grammar; optionally invert learned term probabilities to promote exploration, balancing exploitation and exploration in quantifier reasoning.

Result: The paper proposes a learning-based instantiation framework. The abstract does not report empirical results; the contribution is a methodological framework and its potential integration with existing techniques.

Conclusion: Introduces a novel, adaptable instantiation framework that could enhance coverage of instantiations and balance exploitation and exploration; highlights the need for empirical evaluation and integration with current SMT solvers.

Abstract: Quantified formulas pose a significant challenge for Satisfiability Modulo
Theories (SMT) solvers due to their inherent undecidability. Existing
instantiation techniques, such as e-matching, syntax-guided, model-based,
conflict-based, and enumerative methods, often complement each other. This
paper introduces a novel instantiation approach that dynamically learns from
these techniques during solving. By treating observed instantiations as samples
from a latent language, we use probabilistic context-free grammars to generate
new, similar terms. Our method not only mimics successful past instantiations
but also explores diversity by optionally inverting learned term probabilities,
aiming to balance exploitation and exploration in quantifier reasoning.

*Yifei Chen,Guanting Dong,Yutao Zhu,Zhicheng Dou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A study systematically analyzes ensemble approaches for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), providing entropy-based theoretical justification and insights into pipeline/module designs, showing multi-RAG ensembles improve robustness and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single RAG frameworks often struggle to adapt to diverse downstream tasks; combining multiple RAG systems via ensemble methods can leverage complementary strengths to improve performance and robustness.

Method: Theoretical analysis using information entropy to explain RAG ensembles; mechanism analysis at pipeline and module levels. Four pipelines (Branching, Iterative, Loop, Agentic) and three modules (Generator, Retriever, Reranker) are examined to address seven research questions. Empirical evaluation demonstrates generalizability and robustness of multi-RAG ensembles.

Result: Aggregating multiple RAG systems is generalizable and robust, effective at both the pipeline and module levels. The study provides a foundational understanding and design guidance for multi-RAG ensemble research.

Conclusion: The work validates the viability of multi-RAG ensembles and offers entropy-based justification and systematic design insights across pipelines and modules, laying groundwork for future multi-RAG research and applications.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology has been widely applied in
recent years. However, despite the emergence of various RAG frameworks, a
single RAG framework still cannot adapt well to a broad range of downstream
tasks. Therefore, how to leverage the advantages of multiple RAG systems has
become an area worth exploring. To address this issue, we have conducted a
comprehensive and systematic investigation into ensemble methods based on RAG
systems. Specifically, we have analyzed the RAG ensemble framework from both
theoretical and mechanistic analysis perspectives. From the theoretical
analysis, we provide the first explanation of the RAG ensemble framework from
the perspective of information entropy. In terms of mechanism analysis, we have
explored the RAG ensemble framework from both the pipeline and module levels.
We carefully select four different pipelines (Branching, Iterative, Loop, and
Agentic) and three different modules (Generator, Retriever, and Reranker) to
solve seven different research questions. The experiments show that aggregating
multiple RAG systems is both generalizable and robust, whether at the pipeline
level or the module level. Our work lays the foundation for similar research on
the multi-RAG system ensemble.

### [195] [Improved Generalized Planning with LLMs through Strategy Refinement and Reflection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13876)
*Katharina Stein,Nils Hodel,Daniel Fišer,Jörg Hoffmann,Michael Katz,Alexander Koller*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes improvements to LLM-assisted generation of generalized plans in PDDL by using pseudocode strategy, automatic debugging, reflection, and multiple program variants; shows improvements across 17 domains, with best programs solving all tasks in 12 domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of a single natural-language strategy guiding code generation, and reduce errors in implementing generalized plans; aim to increase reliability and quality of LLM-driven planning across tasks.

Method: Introduce a workflow where the strategy is generated as pseudocode and separately debugged; add a reflection step for diagnosing plan failures; generate multiple program variants and select the best; evaluate on 17 benchmark PDDL domains.

Result: Extensions substantially improve plan quality and never deteriorate it; in 12 domains, the best Python programs solve all tasks that can be generated with the respective instance generators.

Conclusion: The combination of pseudocode strategy, debugging/reflection, and multiple variants robustifies LLM-guided generalized planning in PDDL, enabling error detection and correction before plan generation and improving generalization across domains.

Abstract: LLMs have recently been used to generate Python programs representing
generalized plans in PDDL planning, i.e., plans that generalize across the
tasks of a given PDDL domain. Previous work proposed a framework consisting of
three steps: the LLM first generates a summary and then a strategy for the
domain, both in natural language, and then implements that strategy as a Python
program, that gets debugged on example planning tasks. In that work, only one
strategy is generated and passed directly to the program generation. If the
strategy is incorrect, its implementation will therefore result in an incorrect
generalized plan. Here, we introduce an approach that generates the strategy in
the form of pseudocode and enables automatic debugging of the pseudocode, hence
allowing us to identify and fix errors prior to the generation of the
generalized plan itself. Additionally, we extend the Python debugging phase
with a reflection step prompting the LLM to pinpoint the reason for the
observed plan failure. Finally, we take inspiration from LLM code generation to
produce several program variants and pick the best one. Running experiments on
17 benchmark domains, we show that these extensions substantially improve (and
never deteriorate) the quality of the generalized plans. In 12 of the domains,
our best Python programs solve all tasks that can be generated with the
respective instance generator.

*Yihao Ang,Yifan Bao,Lei Jiang,Jiajie Tao,Anthony K. H. Tung,Lukasz Szpruch,Hao Ni*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TS-Agent is a modular agent-based framework that automates and improves time-series modeling for finance by structuring model selection, code refinement, and fine-tuning via a planner with knowledge banks, delivering better accuracy, robustness, and auditability than AutoML and baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time-series modeling in finance requires high performance, interpretability, auditable processes, and adaptable workflows. AutoML often lacks domain-specific responsiveness, while LLM-based agents offer flexible automation; TS-Agent aims to bridge this gap.

Method: A modular agentic framework that frames the workflow as a three-stage iterative decision process: model selection, code refinement, and fine-tuning. Central planner agent uses structured knowledge banks and libraries of models/refinement strategies to guide exploration, enabling contextual reasoning, experimental feedback, adaptive learning, robust debugging, and transparent auditing.

Result: Empirical evaluation on diverse financial forecasting and synthetic data generation tasks shows TS-Agent consistently outperforms state-of-the-art AutoML and agentic baselines in accuracy, robustness, and decision traceability.

Conclusion: TS-Agent provides an interpretable, auditable, and robust agentic approach for finance-oriented time-series modeling, addressing adaptivity and domain-control needs, with demonstrated gains in accuracy and traceability.

Abstract: Time-series data is central to decision-making in financial markets, yet
building high-performing, interpretable, and auditable models remains a major
challenge. While Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) frameworks streamline
model development, they often lack adaptability and responsiveness to
domain-specific needs and evolving objectives. Concurrently, Large Language
Models (LLMs) have enabled agentic systems capable of reasoning, memory
management, and dynamic code generation, offering a path toward more flexible
workflow automation. In this paper, we introduce \textsf{TS-Agent}, a modular
agentic framework designed to automate and enhance time-series modeling
workflows for financial applications. The agent formalizes the pipeline as a
structured, iterative decision process across three stages: model selection,
code refinement, and fine-tuning, guided by contextual reasoning and
experimental feedback. Central to our architecture is a planner agent equipped
with structured knowledge banks, curated libraries of models and refinement
strategies, which guide exploration, while improving interpretability and
reducing error propagation. \textsf{TS-Agent} supports adaptive learning,
robust debugging, and transparent auditing, key requirements for high-stakes
environments such as financial services. Empirical evaluations on diverse
financial forecasting and synthetic data generation tasks demonstrate that
\textsf{TS-Agent} consistently outperforms state-of-the-art AutoML and agentic
baselines, achieving superior accuracy, robustness, and decision traceability.

### [197] [The Collaboration Paradox: Why Generative AI Requires Both Strategic Intelligence and Operational Stability in Supply Chain Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13942)
*Soumyadeep Dhar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI-driven agents in a multi-echelon supply chain can catastrophically underperform due to a collaboration paradox (inventory hoarding); stability requires a two-layer design: high-level AI policy setting and low-level proactive replenishment, plus a framework to autonomously explore viable strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand emergent strategic behavior and risks of collaborative AI agents in economic systems, particularly in supply chains susceptible to bullwhip, and establish design principles for robust AI-driven business analytics.

Method: Computational experiments using generative AI agents powered by LLMs within a controlled supply-chain simulation to isolate behavioral tendencies; comparison to non-AI baselines; development and testing of a two-layer synthesis framework (policy-setting + execution protocol).

Result: Identification of a collaboration paradox where theoretically superior AI-enabled VMI agents perform worse than baselines due to inventory hoarding. Resilience arises from combining high-level proactive policy setting with a low-level collaborative execution protocol that maintains downstream replenishment. A final framework autonomously generates, evaluates, and quantifies a portfolio of viable strategic choices.

Conclusion: Highlights emergent behaviors of collaborative AI agents in business contexts and provides a blueprint for designing stable, effective AI-driven systems for analytics, emphasizing the need for coordinated policy and execution layers to prevent destabilizing dynamics.

Abstract: The rise of autonomous, AI-driven agents in economic settings raises critical
questions about their emergent strategic behavior. This paper investigates
these dynamics in the cooperative context of a multi-echelon supply chain, a
system famously prone to instabilities like the bullwhip effect. We conduct
computational experiments with generative AI agents, powered by Large Language
Models (LLMs), within a controlled supply chain simulation designed to isolate
their behavioral tendencies. Our central finding is the "collaboration
paradox": a novel, catastrophic failure mode where theoretically superior
collaborative AI agents, designed with Vendor-Managed Inventory (VMI)
principles, perform even worse than non-AI baselines. We demonstrate that this
paradox arises from an operational flaw where agents hoard inventory, starving
the system. We then show that resilience is only achieved through a synthesis
of two distinct layers: high-level, AI-driven proactive policy-setting to
establish robust operational targets, and a low-level, collaborative execution
protocol with proactive downstream replenishment to maintain stability. Our
final framework, which implements this synthesis, can autonomously generate,
evaluate, and quantify a portfolio of viable strategic choices. The work
provides a crucial insight into the emergent behaviors of collaborative AI
agents and offers a blueprint for designing stable, effective AI-driven systems
for business analytics.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Framework to refine/customize LLMs to generate PyChrono simulation scripts and answer API questions, lowering the entry barrier for multi-physics simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable experts to effectively use PyChrono by providing AI-generated script starting points and API guidance; address barriers to adopting simulation tools; design generalizable for other domains.

Method: Refine and customize multiple LLM classes (open- and closed-source) to improve the quality of generated PyChrono scripts; enable generation of scripts for experiments from simple pendulums to complex vehicle-on-deformable-terrain scenarios; LLMs also answer API questions and propose modeling approaches; the framework is generalizable.

Result: Quantifiable improvement in the quality of generated PyChrono scripts; scripts often serve as strong starting points for user refinement; LLMs can answer specific API questions and recommend modeling approaches.

Conclusion: The framework is generalizable and can lower the entry barrier for simulation tools in other domains, showcasing AI-assisted scripting for simulation workflows.

Abstract: This contribution is concerned with the following issue: can pretrained large
language models (LLMs) be refined and customized to the point where they become
virtual assistants helping experts with the effective use of a simulation tool?
In this case study, the ``simulation tool'' considered is PyChrono, an open
source multi-physics dynamics engine for multibody systems. We present a
framework for refining and customizing both open- and closed-source LLMs to
harness the power of AI in generating scripts that perform PyChrono virtual
experiments. We refine and customize several classes of LLMs through a process
that leads to a quantifiable improvement in the quality of the generated
PyChrono simulation scripts. These scripts can range from simple
single-pendulum simulations to complex virtual experiments involving full
vehicles on deformable terrain. While the generated scripts are rarely perfect,
they often serve as strong starting points for the user to modify and improve
on. Additionally, the LLM can answer specific API questions about the
simulator, or recommend modeling approaches. The framework discussed is general
and can be applied to lower the entry barrier for simulation tools associated
with other application domains.

*Christian Blum,Pedro Pinacho-Davidson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BRKGA-based solution for LRS achieves state-of-the-art results, prioritizing evaluation efficiency; competitive with Max-Min Ant System and CPLEX ILP, but struggles with large alphabets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Longest Run Subsequence problem is NP-hard and relevant to genome reassembly; efficient and scalable solvers are needed, especially when evaluating candidate solutions is expensive.

Method: Proposes a Biased Random Key Genetic Algorithm (BRKGA) with a focus on efficiently mapping gray-valued genomes to feasible LRS solutions; implements a Max-Min Ant System for comparison and uses CPLEX ILP to solve instances; evaluates performance on benchmark instances.

Result: BRKGA currently represents state-of-the-art performance for LRS; however, improvements are possible, particularly for inputs with large alphabet sizes.

Conclusion: BRKGA is a strong approach for LRS, but future work should address scalability to larger alphabets and possibly enhance evaluation efficiency or representation to further close the gap with potential optimal or ILP baselines.

Abstract: The longest run subsequence (LRS) problem is an NP-hard combinatorial
optimization problem belonging to the class of subsequence problems from
bioinformatics. In particular, the problem plays a role in genome reassembly.
In this paper, we present a solution to the LRS problem using a Biased Random
Key Genetic Algorithm (BRKGA). Our approach places particular focus on the
computational efficiency of evaluating individuals, which involves converting
vectors of gray values into valid solutions to the problem. For comparison
purposes, a Max-Min Ant System is developed and implemented. This is in
addition to the application of the integer linear programming solver CPLEX for
solving all considered problem instances. The computation results show that the
proposed BRKGA is currently a state-of-the-art technique for the LRS problem.
Nevertheless, the results also show that there is room for improvement,
especially in the context of input strings based on large alphabet sizes.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A scalable framework, ComputerRL, unifies API calls and direct GUI interactions to enable autonomous desktop agents; uses distributed RL and Entropulse training to scale and stabilize learning; achieves state-of-the-art on OSWorld with AutoGLM-OS-9B, validating general desktop automation improvements.


<details>

Motivation: Bridge the gap between machine agents and human-centric desktop environments and enable scalable, robust generalization across diverse desktop tasks; address inefficiencies and instability in long-running RL training.

Method: Proposes the API-GUI paradigm to unify programmatic API calls with GUI actions; builds a distributed RL infrastructure enabling thousands of parallel virtual desktops; introduces Entropulse, alternating reinforcement learning with supervised fine-tuning to mitigate entropy collapse; evaluates on OSWorld using open models GLM-4-9B-0414 and Qwen2.5-14B and yields AutoGLM-OS-9B derived from GLM-4-9B-0414.

Result: Achieves a new state-of-the-art OSWorld accuracy of 48.1% with AutoGLM-OS-9B; demonstrates substantial improvements for general desktop automation agents.

Conclusion: The framework and training strategy effectively enable scalable, robust desktop intelligence and are being adopted in AutoGLM, highlighting the promise of API-GUI fusion, large-scale distributed RL, and entropy-aware training for real-world desktop automation.

Abstract: We introduce ComputerRL, a framework for autonomous desktop intelligence that
enables agents to operate complex digital workspaces skillfully. ComputerRL
features the API-GUI paradigm, which unifies programmatic API calls and direct
GUI interaction to address the inherent mismatch between machine agents and
human-centric desktop environments. Scaling end-to-end RL training is crucial
for improvement and generalization across diverse desktop tasks, yet remains
challenging due to environmental inefficiency and instability in extended
training. To support scalable and robust training, we develop a distributed RL
infrastructure capable of orchestrating thousands of parallel virtual desktop
environments to accelerate large-scale online RL. Furthermore, we propose
Entropulse, a training strategy that alternates reinforcement learning with
supervised fine-tuning, effectively mitigating entropy collapse during extended
training runs. We employ ComputerRL on open models GLM-4-9B-0414 and
Qwen2.5-14B, and evaluate them on the OSWorld benchmark. The AutoGLM-OS-9B
based on GLM-4-9B-0414 achieves a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 48.1%,
demonstrating significant improvements for general agents in desktop
automation. The algorithm and framework are adopted in building AutoGLM (Liu et

*Yingfan Zhou,Philip Sanderink,Sigurd Jager Lemming,Cheng Fang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A differentiable musculoskeletal model (Diff-MSM) enables end-to-end identification of subject-specific muscle and bone parameters from observable signals without measuring internal joint torques, outperforming baselines in simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Personalizing Hill-type muscle and bone parameters is essential for realistic simulations and safety-critical human-robot interaction, but in vivo measurement of internal variables (notably joint torques) is impractical.

Method: Propose Diff-MSM with an end-to-end differentiable pipeline from measured muscle activation through joint torque to observable motion, enabling simultaneous identification of muscle and bone parameters via automatic differentiation.

Result: Extensive simulations show Diff-MSM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving very accurate muscle-parameter estimates; with ordinary initial guesses (mean ground truth, 10% std), the average error can be as low as 0.05%.

Conclusion: Diff-MSM enables precise subject-specific musculoskeletal models and has potential applications in muscle health monitoring, rehabilitation, sports science, and safety-critical human-robot interactions such as co-transportation and exoskeleton-assisted rehabilitation.

Abstract: High-fidelity personalized human musculoskeletal models are crucial for
simulating realistic behavior of physically coupled human-robot interactive
systems and verifying their safety-critical applications in simulations before
actual deployment, such as human-robot co-transportation and rehabilitation
through robotic exoskeletons. Identifying subject-specific Hill-type muscle
model parameters and bone dynamic parameters is essential for a personalized
musculoskeletal model, but very challenging due to the difficulty of measuring
the internal biomechanical variables in vivo directly, especially the joint
torques. In this paper, we propose using Differentiable MusculoSkeletal Model
(Diff-MSM) to simultaneously identify its muscle and bone parameters with an
end-to-end automatic differentiation technique differentiating from the
measurable muscle activation, through the joint torque, to the resulting
observable motion without the need to measure the internal joint torques.
Through extensive comparative simulations, the results manifested that our
proposed method significantly outperformed the state-of-the-art baseline
methods, especially in terms of accurate estimation of the muscle parameters
(i.e., initial guess sampled from a normal distribution with the mean being the
ground truth and the standard deviation being 10% of the ground truth could end
up with an average of the percentage errors of the estimated values as low as
0.05%). In addition to human musculoskeletal modeling and simulation, the new
parameter identification technique with the Diff-MSM has great potential to
enable new applications in muscle health monitoring, rehabilitation, and sports
science.

TL;DR: A low-cost, modular mobile surveillance robot that streams real-time video and accepts spoken commands, using two Raspberry Pis, YOLOv3 for object detection, FFmpeg for streaming, Python speech tools for multilingual interaction, and a Kinect RGB-D sensor, with indoor CPU-based operation and discussion of extensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Make mobile surveillance affordable and reproducible, enabling remote monitoring and steering via phone/browser with multilingual voice interaction.

Method: Hardware: two Raspberry Pis (front robot with camera, mic, speaker; central unit for feed and perception) and Kinect RGB-D. Software: video streaming via FFmpeg; object detection with YOLOv3 on CPU; speech recognition, translation, and text-to-speech for multilingual voice control; commands translated to actions; perception running on central unit; potential sensor fusion with ultrasonic data; tests show interactive frame-rate object detection and command recognition without manual control.

Result: Indoors, the robot detects common objects at interactive frame rates on CPU, reliably recognizes spoken commands, and executes actions without manual control. The setup is reproducible using off-the-shelf hardware and open software.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates feasible real-time surveillance and voice-driven control on accessible hardware, while acknowledging limitations and suggesting extensions such as GPU acceleration, sensor fusion, and added recognition capabilities.

Abstract: We build a mobile surveillance robot that streams video in real time and
responds to speech so a user can monitor and steer it from a phone or browser.
The system uses two Raspberry Pi 4 units: a front unit on a differential drive
base with camera, mic, and speaker, and a central unit that serves the live
feed and runs perception. Video is sent with FFmpeg. Objects in the scene are
detected using YOLOv3 to support navigation and event awareness. For voice
interaction, we use Python libraries for speech recognition, multilingual
translation, and text-to-speech, so the robot can take spoken commands and read
back responses in the requested language. A Kinect RGB-D sensor provides visual
input and obstacle cues. In indoor tests the robot detects common objects at
interactive frame rates on CPU, recognises commands reliably, and translates
them to actions without manual control. The design relies on off-the-shelf
hardware and open software, making it easy to reproduce. We discuss limits and
practical extensions, including sensor fusion with ultrasonic range data, GPU
acceleration, and adding face and text recognition.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: IGHA* is an anytime tree-search method that incrementally expands a tree of motion-primitives for kinodynamic/path planning, avoiding rigid grid pruning and enabling real-time planning in complex dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inefficiency of planning over very large trees for autonomous driving/off-road scenarios, where solving two-point boundary-value problems makes graph construction slow and fixed-grid pruning in Hybrid A* is brittle to grid resolution.

Method: Incremental Generalized Hybrid A* (IGHA*): an anytime tree-search that dynamically organizes vertex expansions without rigid pruning, provably matches or outperforms Hybrid A*. It uses an incremental, flexible expansion strategy to avoid pre-set grid pruning while maintaining completeness/quality guarantees.

Result: IGHA* achieves about 6x fewer expansions to the best solution than an optimized HA* across on-road kinematic and off-road kinodynamic planning; in high-fidelity simulations, IGHA* outperforms HA*M when paired with an MPC controller; demonstrates real-time performance in simulation and on a small-scale off-road vehicle.

Conclusion: IGHA* enables fast, robust kinodynamic planning for complex dynamics with real-time applicability, avoiding brittle grid pruning and matching or exceeding HA* performance; code is available for further use and validation.

Abstract: We address the problem of efficiently organizing search over very large
trees, which arises in many applications ranging from autonomous driving to
aerial vehicles. Here, we are motivated by off-road autonomy, where real-time
planning is essential. Classical approaches use graphs of motion primitives and
exploit dominance to mitigate the curse of dimensionality and prune expansions
efficiently. However, for complex dynamics, repeatedly solving two-point
boundary-value problems makes graph construction too slow for fast kinodynamic
planning. Hybrid A* (HA*) addressed this challenge by searching over a tree of
motion primitives and introducing approximate pruning using a grid-based
dominance check. However, choosing the grid resolution is difficult: too coarse
risks failure, while too fine leads to excessive expansions and slow planning.
We propose Incremental Generalized Hybrid A* (IGHA*), an anytime tree-search
framework that dynamically organizes vertex expansions without rigid pruning.
IGHA* provably matches or outperforms HA*. For both on-road kinematic and
off-road kinodynamic planning queries for a car-like robot, variants of IGHA*
use 6x fewer expansions to the best solution compared to an optimized version
of HA*. In simulated off-road experiments in a high fidelity simulator, IGHA*
outperforms HA*M when both are used in the loop with a model predictive
controller. We demonstrate real-time performance both in simulation and on a
small-scale off-road vehicle, enabling fast, robust planning under complex
dynamics. Code: https://github.com/personalrobotics/IGHAStar

TL;DR: Benders Decomposition is applied to task and motion planning under Signal Temporal Logic constraints to tackle NP-hard MIPs with non-convex kinematic constraints, enabling faster planning than monolithic optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the intractability of solving a single large mixed-integer program for hybrid task scheduling and continuous motion planning in bipedal locomotion, aggravated by non-convex kinematic reachability and footstep rotation constraints.

Method: Formulate a master problem that proposes a task-level plan meeting the temporal logic constraints, and a sequence of subproblems that verify kinematics and dynamics feasibility; use iterative cutting planes to refine the plan.

Result: Experiments show that the Benders-based method yields faster planning compared to alternative algorithms for solving the resulting nonlinear-constrained optimization.

Conclusion: Benders Decomposition provides a scalable, iterative framework for planning under STLC constraints in hybrid, non-convex MIPs, with demonstrated computational advantages.

Abstract: Task and motion planning under Signal Temporal Logic constraints is known to
be NP-hard. A common class of approaches formulates these hybrid problems,
which involve discrete task scheduling and continuous motion planning, as
mixed-integer programs (MIP). However, in applications for bipedal locomotion,
introduction of non-convex constraints such as kinematic reachability and
footstep rotation exacerbates the computational complexity of MIPs. In this
work, we present a method based on Benders Decomposition to address scenarios
where solving the entire monolithic optimization problem is prohibitively
intractable. Benders Decomposition proposes an iterative cutting-plane
technique that partitions the problem into a master problem to prototype a plan
that meets the task specification, and a series of subproblems for kinematics
and dynamics feasibility checks. Our experiments demonstrate that this method
achieves faster planning compared to alternative algorithms for solving the
resulting optimization program with nonlinear constraints.

Motivation: There is a shortage of standardized, real-world benchmarks for evaluating whole-body robotic athletic performance and for direct human-robot comparisons using accessible, scalable methods.

Method: A pipeline that leverages motion-sensing console games to capture moves, reconstruct motions, and retarget them for robotic execution on a humanoid/legged robot, validated on a Unitree G1 with an open-source whole-body controller to benchmark against a human player.

Result: The system demonstrates feasibility and provides a quantitative baseline comparing robot performance to a human, illustrating that commercial game platforms can serve as physically grounded benchmarks for embodied AI.

Conclusion: Promotes further benchmarking work in embodied AI using consumer gaming platforms and motivates expansion to more agents, tasks, and real-world settings.

Abstract: Recent advances in whole-body robot control have enabled humanoid and legged
robots to execute increasingly agile and coordinated movements. However,
standardized benchmarks for evaluating robotic athletic performance in
real-world settings and in direct comparison to humans remain scarce. We
present Switch4EAI(Switch-for-Embodied-AI), a low-cost and easily deployable
pipeline that leverages motion-sensing console games to evaluate whole-body
robot control policies. Using Just Dance on the Nintendo Switch as a
representative example, our system captures, reconstructs, and retargets
in-game choreography for robotic execution. We validate the system on a Unitree
G1 humanoid with an open-source whole-body controller, establishing a
quantitative baseline for the robot's performance against a human player. In
the paper, we discuss these results, which demonstrate the feasibility of using
commercial games platform as physically grounded benchmarks and motivate future
work to for benchmarking embodied AI.

### [206] [CAST: Counterfactual Labels Improve Instruction Following in Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13446)
*Catherine Glossop,William Chen,Arjun Bhorkar,Dhruv Shah,Sergey Levine*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Augment robot datasets with counterfactual labels generated by vision-language models to improve instruction-following in vision-language-action policies, achieving a +27% success rate on navigation tasks without extra data collection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLA approaches struggle with fine-grained commands due to limited semantic diversity and poor language grounding in robot datasets; richer grounding is needed for robust instruction following.

Method: Use vision-language models to generate counterfactual language and actions to relabel existing robot datasets (no new data collection). Train and evaluate VLA policies on visual-language navigation tasks across multiple indoor/outdoor environments, with tasks ranging from object-centric to complex referential instructions.

Result: Counterfactual relabeling improves instruction-following performance significantly, making VLA policies competitive with state-of-the-art methods and increasing navigation task success rate by about 27% without additional data collection.

Conclusion: Counterfactual relabeling is an effective data augmentation strategy for grounding language in robotics, enhancing fine-grained instruction following without additional data collection and likely applicable beyond navigation tasks.

Abstract: Generalist robots should be able to understand and follow user instructions,
but current vision-language-action (VLA) models struggle with following
fine-grained commands despite providing a powerful architecture for mapping
open-vocabulary natural language instructions to robot actions. One cause for
this is a lack of semantic diversity and language grounding in existing robot
datasets and, specifically, a lack of fine-grained task diversity for similar
observations. To address this, we present a novel method to augment existing
robot datasets by leveraging vision language models to create counterfactual
labels. Our method improves the language-following capabilities of VLAs by
increasing the diversity and granularity of language grounding for robot
datasets by generating counterfactual language and actions. We evaluate the
resulting model's ability to follow language instructions, ranging from simple
object-centric commands to complex referential tasks, by conducting visual
language navigation experiments in 3 different indoor and outdoor environments.
Our experiments demonstrate that counterfactual relabeling, without any
additional data collection, significantly improves instruction-following in VLA
policies, making them competitive with state-of-the-art methods and increasing
success rate by 27% on navigation tasks.

### [207] [Modeling and Control of AWOISV: A Filtered Tube-Based MPC Approach for Simultaneous Tracking of Lateral Position and Heading Angle](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13457)
*Xu Yang,Jun Ni,Hengyang Feng,Feiyu Wang,Tiezhen Wang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes an all-wheel omni-directional independent steering vehicle (AWOISV) with 90-degree wheel steering. Introduces a theta_R-beta_R representation and a generalized v-beta-r dynamic model to decouple longitudinal and lateral motions, paired with a filtered tube-based LTV MPC for robust, real-time tracking of position and heading across all motion modes; validated via co-simulation and HIL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable novel drivability and maneuvers (yaw, diagonal motion) through fully steerable wheels, and provide a unified, robust control framework that handles multiple motion modes and mode switching.

Method: Define theta_R and beta_R from the instantaneous center of rotation, derive a generalized v-beta-r dynamic model with states (v, beta, r) and inputs (theta_R, beta_R), decouple longitudinal/lateral motions, and design a filtered tube-based linear time-varying MPC (FT-LTVMPC) for simultaneous lateral position and heading tracking; establish switching criteria between motion modes.

Result: The FT-LTVMPC achieves high-precision tracking of both lateral position and arbitrary heading with robustness to model errors and parameter uncertainties; simulation and HIL experiments demonstrate real-time feasibility and good performance.

Conclusion: The proposed FTC-LTVMPC framework enables seamless mode transitions and robust, accurate control for AWOISVs across all motion modes, validating the practicality of omni-directional steering for high-performance vehicles.

Abstract: An all-wheel omni-directional independent steering vehicle (AWOISV) is a
specialized all-wheel independent steering vehicle with each wheel capable of
steering up to 90{\deg}, enabling unique maneuvers like yaw and diagonal
movement. This paper introduces a theoretical steering radius angle and
sideslip angle (\( \theta_R \)-\(\beta_R \)) representation, based on the
position of the instantaneous center of rotation relative to the wheel rotation
center, defining the motion modes and switching criteria for AWOISVs. A
generalized \( v\)-\(\beta\)-\(r \) dynamic model is developed with forward
velocity \(v\), sideslip angle \(\beta\), and yaw rate \(r\) as states, and
\(\theta_R\) and \(\beta_R\) as control inputs. This model decouples
longitudinal and lateral motions into forward and rotational motions, allowing
seamless transitions across all motion modes under specific conditions. A
filtered tube-based linear time-varying MPC (FT-LTVMPC) strategy is proposed,
achieving simultaneous tracking of lateral position and arbitrary heading
angles, with robustness to model inaccuracies and parameter uncertainties.
Co-simulation and hardware-in-loop (HIL) experiments confirm that FT-LTVMPC
enables high-precision control of both position and heading while ensuring
excellent real-time performance.

*Rohan Chandra,Shubham Singh,Abhishek Jha,Dannon Andrade,Hriday Sainathuni,Katia Sycara*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A unified taxonomy and evaluation framework for Social Mini-Games (SMG) navigation in multi-robot systems; first comprehensive survey classifying SMG solvers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SMGs involve constrained, high-agency interactions that traditional multi-robot navigation methods struggle to handle; inconsistent assumptions and objectives across works hinder comparison and practical application; a unified taxonomy and baselines are needed.

Method: Define a clear SMG taxonomy, identify key dimensions (centralized vs decentralized, observability, communication, cooperation, objectives), systematically review and classify existing SMG solvers, and discuss evaluation protocols and baselines.

Result: Provides the first catalog of SMG solvers using a unified taxonomy, highlights gaps between common assumptions and objectives, and offers guidelines for evaluation and future research.

Conclusion: A unified taxonomy and evaluation framework is essential for advancing SMG navigation research; the survey enables consistent baselines, easier entry for newcomers, and clearer guidance for practitioners.

Abstract: The ``Last Mile Challenge'' has long been considered an important, yet
unsolved, challenge for autonomous vehicles, public service robots, and
delivery robots. A central issue in this challenge is the ability of robots to
navigate constrained and cluttered environments (e.g., doorways, hallways,
corridor intersections), often while competing for space with other robots and
humans. We refer to these environments as ``Social Mini-Games'' (SMGs). SMGs
are tightly coupled, high-agency interactions that arise within general
multi-robot navigation (MRN) scenarios. They are identified through certain
distinct characteristics and require specialized metrics to evaluate them.
Traditional navigation approaches designed for MRN do not perform well in SMGs,
which has led to focused research on dedicated SMG solvers (navigation methods
specialized to navigate in SMGs), which has flourished in recent years.
However, publications on SMG navigation research make different assumptions (on
centralized versus decentralized, observability, communication, cooperation,
etc.), and have different objective functions (safety versus liveness). These
assumptions and objectives are sometimes implicitly assumed or described
informally. This makes it difficult to establish appropriate baselines for
comparison in research papers, as well as making it difficult for practitioners
to find the papers relevant to their concrete application. Such ad-hoc
representation of the field also presents a barrier to new researchers wanting
to start research in this area. SMG navigation research requires its own
taxonomy, definitions, and evaluation protocols to guide effective research
moving forward. This survey is the first to catalog SMG solvers using a
well-defined and unified taxonomy and to classify existing methods accordingly.

### [209] [ROVER: Robust Loop Closure Verification with Trajectory Prior in Repetitive Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13488)
*Jingwen Yu,Jiayi Yang,Anjun Hu,Jiankun Wang,Ping Tan,Hong Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ROVER uses the robot’s historical trajectory as a prior to verify loop closures in SLAM, by re-estimating the trajectory with the loop candidate and scoring its consistency with the trajectory absent the loop, thereby reducing false positives in repetitive environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: False loop closures can catastrophically corrupt SLAM, especially in repetitive scenes where appearance-based features are unreliable; existing methods focus on invariant features and ignore trajectory-based priors.

Method: For each loop candidate, perform pose-graph optimization to estimate the trajectory including the loop, then evaluate a trajectory-prior score that measures compatibility with the historic trajectory without the loop; accept or reject the loop based on this score. The approach integrates with state-of-the-art SLAM systems and is validated with benchmark tests and real-world experiments.

Result: ROVER demonstrates improved loop-closure verification in challenging repetitive environments and is shown to be robust and efficient; benchmark and real-world experiments support effectiveness; code and a dataset are released.

Conclusion: Incorporating a trajectory prior into loop-closure verification can effectively reject false positives, enhancing SLAM reliability without sacrificing efficiency; ROVER can be integrated into existing SLAM pipelines.

Abstract: Loop closure detection is important for simultaneous localization and mapping
(SLAM), which associates current observations with historical keyframes,
achieving drift correction and global relocalization. However, a falsely
detected loop can be fatal, and this is especially difficult in repetitive
environments where appearance-based features fail due to the high similarity.
Therefore, verification of a loop closure is a critical step in avoiding false
positive detections. Existing works in loop closure verification predominantly
focus on learning invariant appearance features, neglecting the prior knowledge
of the robot's spatial-temporal motion cue, i.e., trajectory. In this letter,
we propose ROVER, a loop closure verification method that leverages the
historical trajectory as a prior constraint to reject false loops in
challenging repetitive environments. For each loop candidate, it is first used
to estimate the robot trajectory with pose-graph optimization. This trajectory
is then submitted to a scoring scheme that assesses its compliance with the
trajectory without the loop, which we refer to as the trajectory prior, to
determine if the loop candidate should be accepted. Benchmark comparisons and
real-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
Furthermore, we integrate ROVER into state-of-the-art SLAM systems to verify
its robustness and efficiency. Our source code and self-collected dataset are
available at https://github.com/jarvisyjw/ROVER.

### [210] [Unified Hierarchical MPC in Task Executing for Modular Manipulators across Diverse Morphologies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13513)
*Maolin Lei,Edoardo Romiti,Arturo Laurenzi,Cheng Zhou,Wanli Xing,Liang Lu,Nikos G. Tsagarakis*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A unified two-tier Hierarchical Model Predictive Control (H-MPC) for modular manipulators that adapts to different morphologies and tasks with minimal tuning, using a high-level planner and a low-level corrective MPC that leverages predicted information to capture second-order dynamics while keeping a linear model. Validated on multiple morphologies with real-world pick-and-place tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable robust, morphology-agnostic control of modular manipulators without extensive retuning, improve trajectory smoothness and handle kinematic constraints and near-singular configurations.

Method: Two-level MPC: high-level MPC forecasts future states and generates trajectory information; low-level MPC refines inputs by updating its predictive model with high-level information and performs secondary linearization to incorporate second-order (Taylor) information while keeping a linearized model. Integrates kinematic constraints and aims for smooth joint-space trajectories; validated on various morphologies with real-world tasks.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness across different manipulator morphologies and executes pick-and-place tasks in real-world scenarios with improved control precision and reliability.

Conclusion: The proposed H-MPC framework provides a morphology-agnostic, accurate, and reliable control strategy for modular manipulators, balancing model simplicity with higher-order information through hierarchical prediction; suitable for diverse configurations and tasks.

Abstract: This work proposes a unified Hierarchical Model Predictive Control (H-MPC)
for modular manipulators across various morphologies, as the controller can
adapt to different configurations to execute the given task without extensive
parameter tuning in the controller. The H-MPC divides the control process into
two levels: a high-level MPC and a low-level MPC. The high-level MPC predicts
future states and provides trajectory information, while the low-level MPC
refines control actions by updating the predictive model based on this
high-level information. This hierarchical structure allows for the integration
of kinematic constraints and ensures smooth joint-space trajectories, even near
singular configurations. Moreover, the low-level MPC incorporates secondary
linearization by leveraging predictive information from the high-level MPC,
effectively capturing the second-order Taylor expansion information of the
kinematic model while still maintaining a linearized model formulation. This
approach not only preserves the simplicity of a linear control model but also
enhances the accuracy of the kinematic representation, thereby improving
overall control precision and reliability. To validate the effectiveness of the
control policy, we conduct extensive evaluations across different manipulator
morphologies and demonstrate the execution of pick-and-place tasks in
real-world scenarios.

### [211] [A Three-Level Whole-Body Disturbance Rejection Control Framework for Dynamic Motions in Legged Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13531)
*Bolin Li,Gewei Zuo,Zhixiang Wang,Xiaotian Ke,Lijun Zhu,Han Ding*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A three-level whole-body disturbance rejection control (T-WB-DRC) framework for legged robots uses a moving horizon extended state observer (MH-ESO) to estimate uncertainties and disturbances, enabling robust full-state feedback control; validated in Gazebo simulations and hardware experiments on a quadruped.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Legged robots face model uncertainties, external disturbances, and faults that degrade stability and performance. Existing two-level disturbance rejection approaches may be insufficient for robust payload transport and fault tolerance. A framework that integrates uncertainty estimation with whole-body planning aims to enhance stability, robustness, and fault tolerance.

Method: 1) Develop a moving horizon extended state observer (MH-ESO) to estimate uncertainties and filter noise in legged dynamics. 2) Propose a three-level whole-body disturbance rejection control (T-WB-DRC) framework that combines plans based on dynamics without uncertainties and with uncertainties for improved performance. 3) Validate via simulations (humanoid and quadruped in Gazebo) and extensive hardware experiments on a quadruped.

Result: Simulation studies in Gazebo show the T-WB-DRC is effective and versatile for both humanoid and quadruped platforms. Experimental trials on a quadruped confirm robustness and stability of the system under a range of disturbance conditions.

Conclusion: T-WB-DRC with MH-ESO enhances stability, robustness, and fault tolerance in legged robots under model uncertainties and disturbances, enabling better payload transport and disturbance rejection, with demonstrated practicality in both simulation and real hardware.

Abstract: This paper presents a control framework designed to enhance the stability and
robustness of legged robots in the presence of uncertainties, including model
uncertainties, external disturbances, and faults. The framework enables the
full-state feedback estimator to estimate and compensate for uncertainties in
whole-body dynamics of the legged robots. First, we propose a novel moving
horizon extended state observer (MH-ESO) to estimate uncertainties and mitigate
noise in legged systems, which can be integrated into the framework for
disturbance compensation. Second, we introduce a three-level whole-body
disturbance rejection control framework (T-WB-DRC). Unlike the previous
two-level approach, this three-level framework considers both the plan based on
whole-body dynamics without uncertainties and the plan based on dynamics with
uncertainties, significantly improving payload transportation, external
disturbance rejection, and fault tolerance. Third, simulations of both humanoid
and quadruped robots in the Gazebo simulator demonstrate the effectiveness and
versatility of T-WB-DRC. Finally, extensive experimental trials on a quadruped
robot validate the robustness and stability of the system when using T-WB-DRC
under various disturbance conditions.

*Chao Tang,Anxing Xiao,Yuhong Deng,Tianrun Hu,Wenlong Dong,Hanbo Zhang,David Hsu,Hong Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: MimicFunc enables one-shot imitation of tool manipulation across diverse tools by using a function-frame with keypoint-based abstractions to transfer skills from a single human RGB-D video to novel tools, and uses generated rollouts to train visuomotor policies without teleoperation data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The core challenge is establishing function-level correspondences across intra-function variations in tool shapes and configurations, which hampers generalization from humans to robots.

Method: Introduce a function-centric local coordinate frame called function frame built from keypoints to capture functional semantics; perform imitation of tool manipulation skills from a single RGB-D human video and map to robot actions across different tools.

Result: Experiments show successful generalization from one human video to manipulating novel tools for functionally equivalent tasks; the generated rollouts are sufficient to train visuomotor policies without labor-intensive teleoperation data; code and video are released.

Conclusion: MimicFunc offers a data-efficient, scalable path for cross-tool manipulation generalization by aligning functional semantics via a function-frame representation, enabling one-shot transfer from humans to robots and reducing teleoperation data needs.

Abstract: Imitating tool manipulation from human videos offers an intuitive approach to
teaching robots, while also providing a promising and scalable alternative to
labor-intensive teleoperation data collection for visuomotor policy learning.
While humans can mimic tool manipulation behavior by observing others perform a
task just once and effortlessly transfer the skill to diverse tools for
functionally equivalent tasks, current robots struggle to achieve this level of
generalization. A key challenge lies in establishing function-level
correspondences, considering the significant geometric variations among
functionally similar tools, referred to as intra-function variations. To
address this challenge, we propose MimicFunc, a framework that establishes
functional correspondences with function frame, a function-centric local
coordinate frame constructed with keypoint-based abstraction, for imitating
tool manipulation skills. Experiments demonstrate that MimicFunc effectively
enables the robot to generalize the skill from a single RGB-D human video to
manipulating novel tools for functionally equivalent tasks. Furthermore,
leveraging MimicFunc's one-shot generalization capability, the generated
rollouts can be used to train visuomotor policies without requiring
labor-intensive teleoperation data collection for novel objects. Our code and
video are available at https://sites.google.com/view/mimicfunc.

### [213] [Assessing Pedestrian Behavior Around Autonomous Cleaning Robots in Public Spaces: Findings from a Field Observation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13699)
*Maren Raab,Linda Miller,Zhe Zeng,Pascal Jansen,Martin Baumann,Johannes Kraus*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Field study shows robot type and movement pattern drive pedestrians' lateral adaptations around autonomous cleaning robots; distraction state (phone use) did not significantly alter movement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve momentary transparency and safety of robots in public spaces by understanding how robot kinematics and user states influence pedestrian behavior.

Method: In a field setting, 498 unaware pedestrians were videotaped moving past two autonomous cleaning robots (one larger sweeping robot and one smaller cleaning robot). Two movement patterns were tested: offset rectangular and circular. Pedestrians were categorized as distracted (~8% by smartphones) or not. Movement behaviors, especially lateral adaptations and distances, were analyzed across robot type and pattern.

Result: No significant differences in movement behaviors between distracted and undistracted pedestrians. Robot type (larger sweeping vs smaller cleaning) and movement pattern (offset rectangular vs circular) affected lateral adaptations: larger robot and offset rectangular pattern increased number of lateral adaptations; offset rectangular pattern also increased close lateral adaptations; distances of lateral adaptations varied with robot type and pattern.

Conclusion: The study provides initial insights into pedestrian-robot interactions in public spaces, highlighting robot design (type and motion pattern) as a key driver of pedestrian maneuvering. Distraction state may be less influential than robot kinematics for shaping behavior, informing safer and more transparent robot motion design in HRI.

Abstract: As autonomous robots become more common in public spaces, spontaneous
encounters with laypersons are more frequent. For this, robots need to be
equipped with communication strategies that enhance momentary transparency and
reduce the probability of critical situations. Adapting these robotic
strategies requires consideration of robot movements, environmental conditions,
and user characteristics and states. While numerous studies have investigated
the impact of distraction on pedestrians' movement behavior, limited research
has examined this behavior in the presence of autonomous robots. This research
addresses the impact of robot type and robot movement pattern on distracted and
undistracted pedestrians' movement behavior. In a field setting, unaware
pedestrians were videotaped while moving past two working, autonomous cleaning
robots. Out of N=498 observed pedestrians, approximately 8% were distracted by
smartphones. Distracted and undistracted pedestrians did not exhibit
significant differences in their movement behaviors around the robots. Instead,
both the larger sweeping robot and the offset rectangular movement pattern
significantly increased the number of lateral adaptations compared to the
smaller cleaning robot and the circular movement pattern. The offset
rectangular movement pattern also led to significantly more close lateral
adaptations. Depending on the robot type, the movement patterns led to
differences in the distances of lateral adaptations. The study provides initial
insights into pedestrian movement behavior around an autonomous cleaning robot
in public spaces, contributing to the growing field of HRI research.

*Liyang Liu,Ehsan Mihankhah,Nathan Wallace,Javier Martinez,Andrew J. Hill*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: An autonomous mine-site inspection robot DIPPeR performs robust blast-hole detection and navigation using LiDAR data, projecting 3D cone points into a 2D depth image to locate holes and position down-hole sensors, with validation in simulation and field tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual inspection of blast holes is slow, expensive, and limited in revealing hole geometry and contents. Automating this process can reduce costs and improve down-hole characterization.

Method: Process onboard LiDAR point clouds to extract the cone-shaped drill-waste above ground; project 3D cone points into a virtual depth image for 2D segmentation; detect hole center with a robust detector and non-maximum suppression; ensure precise sensor placement and collision avoidance; dynamically adjust projection parameters during navigation to cope with varying sparsity and hole size; enable continuous tracking of the target hole as the robot approaches the goal point.

Result: The system demonstrates effective hole seeking/navigation and perception in both high-fidelity simulations and on-site field tests; a demonstration video is provided.

Conclusion: The framework enables target-based autonomous navigation and accurate down-hole sensor positioning for automated hole inspection, with robustness to variations in hole appearance and point cloud sparsity, validated by simulations and field tests.

Abstract: In open-pit mining, holes are drilled into the surface of the excavation site
and detonated with explosives to facilitate digging. These blast holes need to
be inspected internally for investigation of downhole material types and
properties. Knowing these properties can lead to significant savings in
material handling costs in downstream processes. Manual hole inspection is slow
and expensive, with major limitations in revealing the geometric and geological
properties of the holes and their contents. This has been the motivation for
the development of our autonomous mine-site inspection robot - "DIPPeR". In
this paper, the automation aspect of the project is explained. We present a
robust blast hole seeking and detection framework that enables target-based
navigation and accurate down-hole sensor positioning. The pipeline first
processes point-cloud data collected by the on-board LiDAR sensors, extracting
the cone-shaped volume of drill-waste above the ground. By projecting the 3D
cone points into a virtual depth image, segmentation is achieved in the 2D
domain, yielding a circular hole at the image centre and a collared cone face.
We then identify the hole centre using a robust detection module while
suppressing non-maximum candidates, ensuring precise sensor placement for
down-hole inspection and avoiding collisions with the cavity wall. To enable
autonomous hole-seeking, the pipeline automatically adjusts its projection
parameters during robot navigation to account for variations in point sparsity
and hole opening size, ensuring a consistent hole appearance in 2D images. This
allows continuous tracking of the target hole as the robot approaches the goal
point. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our navigation and perception system
in both high-fidelity simulation environments and on-site field tests. A
demonstration video is available at

### [215] [Trajectory Tracking and Stabilization of Quadrotors Using Deep Koopman Model Predictive Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13795)
*Haitham El-Hussieny*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A data-driven DK-MPC framework for quadrotors uses a deep Koopman operator to linearize nonlinear dynamics in a latent space, enabling efficient model-predictive control that improves tracking while reducing computation time versus nonlinear MPC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Nonlinear quadrotor dynamics pose challenges for real-time control; standard nonlinear MPC is computationally intensive. A latent linear model via learning (Koopman) could enable fast, accurate trajectory tracking on embedded hardware.

Method: Train a deep Koopman operator on flight data to obtain a high-dimensional latent representation in which quadrotor dynamics are approximately linear. Apply model predictive control in this latent space over a finite horizon to compute control actions. Evaluate via trajectory-following and point-stabilization simulations, comparing against conventional nonlinear MPC.

Result: DK-MPC achieves superior trajectory tracking accuracy and significantly lower computation time compared with nonlinear MPC in numerical experiments.

Conclusion: Koopman-based learning can render complex quadrotor dynamics tractable for real-time MPC, highlighting potential for embedded flight control; future work should address more agile maneuvers and robustness to disturbances.

Abstract: This paper presents a data-driven control framework for quadrotor systems
that integrates a deep Koopman operator with model predictive control (DK-MPC).
The deep Koopman operator is trained on sampled flight data to construct a
high-dimensional latent representation in which the nonlinear quadrotor
dynamics are approximated by linear models. This linearization enables the
application of MPC to efficiently optimize control actions over a finite
prediction horizon, ensuring accurate trajectory tracking and stabilization.
The proposed DK-MPC approach is validated through a series of
trajectory-following and point-stabilization numerical experiments, where it
demonstrates superior tracking accuracy and significantly lower computation
time compared to conventional nonlinear MPC. These results highlight the
potential of Koopman-based learning methods to handle complex quadrotor
dynamics while meeting the real-time requirements of embedded flight control.
Future work will focus on extending the framework to more agile flight
scenarios and improving robustness against external disturbances.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes SGDT, a hierarchical neuro-symbolic framework that uses a symbolic planner to generate subgoals and a goal-conditioned DT to execute low-level multi-robot manipulation, enabling zero-shot and few-shot generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL in robotics is data-hungry and often assumes Markov Decision Processes, which struggle with long-horizon, complex, multi-robot dynamics. Decision Transformers offer offline sequence modeling but have limited exploration in multi-robot manipulation.

Method: A two-level architecture: a neuro-symbolic planner produces symbolic subgoals; a goal-conditioned Decision Transformer (GCDT) uses these subgoals to guide low-level sequential decisions for multiple robots. The approach is causal-transformer-based and hierarchical, promoting interpretable and structured decision making.

Result: Evaluated across diverse task scenarios, including zero-shot and few-shot settings; shows improved interpretability, structure, and generalization in multi-robot manipulation; marks the first DT-based exploration in this domain.

Conclusion: SGDT enables deployable, interpretable, and generalizable multi-robot collaboration by integrating symbolic planning with DT-based decision making, opening avenues for neuro-symbolic planning within offline RL for complex robotic tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated great potential in robotic
operations. However, its data-intensive nature and reliance on the Markov
Decision Process (MDP) assumption limit its practical deployment in real-world
scenarios involving complex dynamics and long-term temporal dependencies, such
as multi-robot manipulation. Decision Transformers (DTs) have emerged as a
promising offline alternative by leveraging causal transformers for sequence
modeling in RL tasks. However, their applications to multi-robot manipulations
still remain underexplored. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework,
Symbolically-Guided Decision Transformer (SGDT), which integrates a
neuro-symbolic mechanism with a causal transformer to enable deployable
multi-robot collaboration. In the proposed SGDT framework, a neuro-symbolic
planner generates a high-level task-oriented plan composed of symbolic
subgoals. Guided by these subgoals, a goal-conditioned decision transformer
(GCDT) performs low-level sequential decision-making for multi-robot
manipulation. This hierarchical architecture enables structured, interpretable,
and generalizable decision making in complex multi-robot collaboration tasks.
We evaluate the performance of SGDT across a range of task scenarios, including
zero-shot and few-shot scenarios. To our knowledge, this is the first work to
explore DT-based technology for multi-robot manipulation.

*Zhaokun Chen,Chaopeng Zhang,Xiaohan Li,Wenshuo Wang,Gentiane Venture,Junqiang Xi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A semantic-privileged-information (SPI) framework for driving style recognition that uses an LLM-generated descriptions (via DriBehavGPT) encoded into machine-friendly features and used as privileged information in SVM+ during training; inference relies only on sensor data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between low-level sensor features and human expert judgments in driving style recognition by leveraging LLM-derived, human-interpretable semantics as privileged information, thereby aligning algorithmic output with expert reasoning without increasing inference complexity.

Method: 1) DriBehavGPT generates natural-language descriptions of driving behaviors. 2) Text descriptions are converted to machine-representations through text embeddings and dimensionality reduction. 3) These representations are used as privileged information in SVM+ during training to guide the model toward human-like interpretations. 4) Inference uses only sensor data, preserving efficiency.

Result: The SPI-enhanced framework achieves notable performance gains, with F1-score improvements of 7.6% for car-following and 7.9% for lane-changing across diverse real-world driving scenarios, outperforming conventional methods.

Conclusion: Semantic, human-centric representations of driving behavior, when used as privileged information during training, can substantially improve recognition accuracy and interpretability while maintaining efficient inference.

Abstract: Existing driving style recognition systems largely depend on low-level
sensor-derived features for training, neglecting the rich semantic reasoning
capability inherent to human experts. This discrepancy results in a fundamental
misalignment between algorithmic classifications and expert judgments. To
bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework that integrates Semantic
Privileged Information (SPI) derived from large language models (LLMs) to align
recognition outcomes with human-interpretable reasoning. First, we introduce
DriBehavGPT, an interactive LLM-based module that generates natural-language
descriptions of driving behaviors. These descriptions are then encoded into
machine learning-compatible representations via text embedding and
dimensionality reduction. Finally, we incorporate them as privileged
information into Support Vector Machine Plus (SVM+) for training, enabling the
model to approximate human-like interpretation patterns. Experiments across
diverse real-world driving scenarios demonstrate that our SPI-enhanced
framework outperforms conventional methods, achieving F1-score improvements of
7.6% (car-following) and 7.9% (lane-changing). Importantly, SPI is exclusively
used during training, while inference relies solely on sensor data, ensuring
computational efficiency without sacrificing performance. These results
highlight the pivotal role of semantic behavioral representations in improving
recognition accuracy while advancing interpretable, human-centric driving
systems.

Comprehensive literature review (>180 studies) to analyze core requirements and trade-offs.

Result: Reveals a fundamental tension between achieving long-term semantic coherence and maintaining real-time responsiveness. Identifies bottlenecks from the Physical Grounding Gap to cross-modal integration, dynamic adaptation, and open-world generalization. Provides a roadmap for principled data-management solutions in EAI.

Conclusion: Advocates a forward-looking research agenda featuring physics-aware data models, adaptive storage-retrieval co-optimization, and standardized benchmarking to guide future work toward robust, high-performance data management for autonomous embodied systems.

Abstract: Embodied AI (EAI) agents continuously interact with the physical world,
generating vast, heterogeneous multimodal data streams that traditional
management systems are ill-equipped to handle. In this survey, we first
systematically evaluate five storage architectures (Graph Databases,
Multi-Model Databases, Data Lakes, Vector Databases, and Time-Series
Databases), focusing on their suitability for addressing EAI's core
requirements, including physical grounding, low-latency access, and dynamic
scalability. We then analyze five retrieval paradigms (Fusion Strategy-Based
Retrieval, Representation Alignment-Based Retrieval, Graph-Structure-Based
Retrieval, Generation Model-Based Retrieval, and Efficient Retrieval-Based
Optimization), revealing a fundamental tension between achieving long-term
semantic coherence and maintaining real-time responsiveness. Based on this
comprehensive analysis, we identify key bottlenecks, spanning from the
foundational Physical Grounding Gap to systemic challenges in cross-modal
integration, dynamic adaptation, and open-world generalization. Finally, we
outline a forward-looking research agenda encompassing physics-aware data
models, adaptive storage-retrieval co-optimization, and standardized
benchmarking, to guide future research toward principled data management
solutions for EAI. Our survey is based on a comprehensive review of more than
180 related studies, providing a rigorous roadmap for designing the robust,
high-performance data management frameworks essential for the next generation
of autonomous embodied systems.

### [219] [Augmenting cobots for sheet-metal SMEs with 3D object recognition and localisation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13964)
*Martijn Cramer,Yanming Wu,David De Schepper,Eric Demeester*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Mobile cobots with 3D object recognition/localisation can transform sheet-metal SMEs handling high-mix-low-volume tasks; the paper maps opportunities, challenges, key integration steps, and includes an industrial implementation example from a prior ACRO project.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SMEs face inefficiencies in high-mix-low-volume production where repetitive manual labour raises costs and underutilizes skilled workers; conventional automation is insufficient, prompting a move toward mobile, reconfigurable cobots enhanced with 3D sensing.

Method: Qualitative analysis outlining opportunities and challenges; presents a step-by-step process for integrating 3D recognition/localisation with cobotic systems; uses past ACRO project as a concrete implementation example.

Result: Provides a structured discussion of opportunities and challenges, a roadmap of integration steps, and a real-world implementation reference from an ACRO collaboration.

Conclusion: Integrating 3D object recognition and localisation with cobots can boost flexibility and productivity in SME sheet-metal workflows, but requires addressing integration, reliability, and cost barriers; the article offers steps and an implementation example to guide adoption.

Abstract: Due to high-mix-low-volume production, sheet-metal workshops today are
challenged by small series and varying orders. As standard automation solutions
tend to fall short, SMEs resort to repetitive manual labour impacting
production costs and leading to tech-skilled workforces not being used to their
full potential. The COOCK+ ROBUST project aims to transform cobots into mobile
and reconfigurable production assistants by integrating existing technologies,
including 3D object recognition and localisation. This article explores both
the opportunities and challenges of enhancing cobotic systems with these
technologies in an industrial setting, outlining the key steps involved in the
process. Additionally, insights from a past project, carried out by the ACRO
research unit in collaboration with an industrial partner, serves as a concrete
implementation example throughout.

### [220] [Toward an Interaction-Centered Approach to Robot Trustworthiness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13976)
*Carlo Mazzola,Hassan Ali,Kristína Malinovská,Igor Farkaš*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: An interaction-based framework to build trustworthy HRI by aligning human trust with robot skills, centered on human awareness and transparency; outlines four components to bridge perceived vs actual robot capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As robots become integrated in human environments, misplaced or overtrust can pose safety, ethical, and reliability concerns; there is a need for a framework that aligns human trust with robot competence.

Method: Conceptual position paper proposing a framework with two pillars (human awareness and transparency) and four components, focusing on mutual understanding rather than empirical evaluation.

Result: Outlines a concrete framework and design considerations for trust-aware HRI, detailing how the two pillars and four components could be instantiated to align trust with robot capabilities.

Conclusion: To foster trustworthy HRI, integrate human awareness and transparency to provide humans with comprehension and control, thereby bridging the gap between perceived trust and robot true capabilities.

Abstract: As robots get more integrated into human environments, fostering
trustworthiness in embodied robotic agents becomes paramount for an effective
and safe human-robot interaction (HRI). To achieve that, HRI applications must
promote human trust that aligns with robot skills and avoid misplaced trust or
overtrust, which can pose safety risks and ethical concerns. To achieve that,
HRI applications must promote human trust that aligns with robot skills and
avoid misplaced trust or overtrust, which can pose safety risks and ethical
concerns. In this position paper, we outline an interaction-based framework for
building trust through mutual understanding between humans and robots. We
emphasize two main pillars: human awareness and transparency, referring to the
robot ability to interpret human actions accurately and to clearly communicate
its intentions and goals, respectively. By integrating these two pillars,
robots can behave in a manner that aligns with human expectations and needs
while providing their human partners with both comprehension and control over
their actions. We also introduce four components that we think are important
for bridging the gap between a human-perceived sense of trust and a robot true
capabilities.

### [221] [The Social Context of Human-Robot Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13982)
*Sydney Thompson,Kate Candon,Marynel Vázquez*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A survey clarifies how 'social context' is used in HRI, proposes a conceptual model to describe it, applies it to prior work, and identifies attributes and open questions to guide future research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inconsistent definitions and usage of 'social context' hinder communication and synthesis across HRI research; a standard framework is needed to understand, model, and evaluate social contexts in human-robot interactions.

Method: Conduct a literature survey of HRI papers for definitions and uses of 'social context'; develop a conceptual model to describe social context; apply the model to existing work; discuss a range of social-context attributes and open research questions.

Result: A conceptual model for describing the social context of HRI; mapping of existing work to the model; a catalog of social-context attributes; practical guidance for planning interactions, developing robot behavior models, and interpreting results; identification of open questions for future research.

Conclusion: The study provides a structured framework to understand and model social context in HRI and highlights numerous open research questions, enabling more consistent communication and more robust design and evaluation of social-robust interactions.

Abstract: The Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) community often highlights the social
context of an interaction as a key consideration when designing, implementing,
and evaluating robot behavior. Unfortunately, researchers use the term "social
context" in varied ways. This can lead to miscommunication, making it
challenging to draw connections between related work on understanding and
modeling the social contexts of human-robot interactions. To address this gap,
we survey the HRI literature for existing definitions and uses of the term
"social context". Then, we propose a conceptual model for describing the social
context of a human-robot interaction. We apply this model to existing work, and
we discuss a range of attributes of social contexts that can help researchers
plan for interactions, develop behavior models for robots, and gain insights
after interactions have taken place. We conclude with a discussion of open
research questions in relation to understanding and modeling the social
contexts of human-robot interactions.

### [222] [Embodied-R1: Reinforced Embodied Reasoning for General Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13998)
*Yifu Yuan,Haiqin Cui,Yaoting Huang,Yibin Chen,Fei Ni,Zibin Dong,Pengyi Li,Yan Zheng,Jianye Hao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This work proposes a pointing-centric, embodiment-agnostic intermediate representation to close the seeing-to-doing gap in embodied AI. It introduces Embodied-R1 (3B VLM) trained with Reinforced Fine-Tuning on a large embodied-pointing dataset, achieving SOTA across 11 benchmarks and strong zero-shot generalization (SIMPLEREnv 56.2%, XArm tasks 87.5%) with robustness to visual disturbances, suggesting a generalizable path from perception to action.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generalization in embodied AI is limited by the seeing-to-doing gap caused by data scarcity and embodiment heterogeneity. An embodiment-agnostic intermediate representation—here, pointing—can bridge high-level vision-language understanding and low-level action primitives across diverse bodies and tasks.

Method: Define four core embodied pointing abilities to bridge perception and action. Create Embodied-Points-200K by aggregating diverse embodied/visual reasoning datasets. Train Embodied-R1, a 3B Vision-Language Model, with a two-stage Reinforced Fine-Tuning (RFT) curriculum and a specialized multi-task reward design.

Result: Embodied-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on 11 embodied spatial/pointing benchmarks. It shows strong zero-shot generalization: 56.2% success in SIMPLEREnv and 87.5% across 8 real-world XArm tasks without task-specific fine-tuning, about a 62% improvement over strong baselines. It is robust to diverse visual disturbances.

Conclusion: Pointing-centric representation combined with Reinforced Fine-Tuning constitutes an effective and generalizable pathway to close the perception-action gap in robotics, enabling better generalization across tasks and embodiments.

Abstract: Generalization in embodied AI is hindered by the "seeing-to-doing gap," which
stems from data scarcity and embodiment heterogeneity. To address this, we
pioneer "pointing" as a unified, embodiment-agnostic intermediate
representation, defining four core embodied pointing abilities that bridge
high-level vision-language comprehension with low-level action primitives. We
introduce Embodied-R1, a 3B Vision-Language Model (VLM) specifically designed
for embodied reasoning and pointing. We use a wide range of embodied and
general visual reasoning datasets as sources to construct a large-scale
dataset, Embodied-Points-200K, which supports key embodied pointing
capabilities. We then train Embodied-R1 using a two-stage Reinforced
Fine-tuning (RFT) curriculum with a specialized multi-task reward design.
Embodied-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on 11 embodied spatial and
pointing benchmarks. Critically, it demonstrates robust zero-shot
generalization by achieving a 56.2% success rate in the SIMPLEREnv and 87.5%
across 8 real-world XArm tasks without any task-specific fine-tuning,
representing a 62% improvement over strong baselines. Furthermore, the model
exhibits high robustness against diverse visual disturbances. Our work shows
that a pointing-centric representation, combined with an RFT training paradigm,
offers an effective and generalizable pathway to closing the perception-action
gap in robotics.

### [223] [Train Once, Deploy Anywhere: Realize Data-Efficient Dynamic Object Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14042)
*Zhuoling Li,Xiaoyang Wu,Zhenhua Xu,Hengshuang Zhao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GEM (Generalizable Entropy-based Manipulation) introduces an entropy-based imitation learning framework that enables strong generalization in dynamic object manipulation from few demonstrations. It demonstrates cross-domain generalization across environments, embodiments, dynamics, and geometries, and achieves real-world success (>97%) in a canteen deployment without in-scene demonstrations over 10,000 tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce labor-intensive demonstration collection while achieving broad generalization in dynamic object manipulation, which is critical for manufacturing efficiency and adaptable robotics.

Method: Proposes an entropy-based theoretical framework to quantify and optimize imitation learning. Based on this framework, the authors design GEM, a system that promotes generalization with limited demonstrations by shaping policy entropy. Evaluations span simulated and real tasks across diverse environment backgrounds, robot embodiments, motion dynamics, and object geometries, including a real-world deployment in a canteen.

Result: GEM demonstrates strong generalization across diverse settings (backgrounds, embodiments, dynamics, geometries). In real deployment, it achieves over 97% success across more than 10,000 operations without any in-scene demonstrations.

Conclusion: An entropy-driven, demonstration-efficient framework can achieve broad generalization in dynamic object manipulation. GEM’s cross-domain success and real-world performance suggest practical viability for manufacturing environments and reduce the burden of collecting demonstrations.

Abstract: Realizing generalizable dynamic object manipulation is important for
enhancing manufacturing efficiency, as it eliminates specialized engineering
for various scenarios. To this end, imitation learning emerges as a promising
paradigm, leveraging expert demonstrations to teach a policy manipulation
skills. Although the generalization of an imitation learning policy can be
improved by increasing demonstrations, demonstration collection is
labor-intensive. To address this problem, this paper investigates whether
strong generalization in dynamic object manipulation is achievable with only a
few demonstrations. Specifically, we develop an entropy-based theoretical
framework to quantify the optimization of imitation learning. Based on this
framework, we propose a system named Generalizable Entropy-based Manipulation
(GEM). Extensive experiments in simulated and real tasks demonstrate that GEM
can generalize across diverse environment backgrounds, robot embodiments,
motion dynamics, and object geometries. Notably, GEM has been deployed in a
real canteen for tableware collection. Without any in-scene demonstration, it
achieves a success rate of over 97% across more than 10,000 operations.
