The verification problem is formulated as an optimization problem that maximizes a performance metric (e.g., the suboptimality after a given number of iterations) over parameters constrained to be in a parameter set and iterate sequences consistent with the SCP update rules. Our framework is general, extending the notion of SCP to include both conventional variants such as trust-region, convex-concave, and prox-linear methods, and algorithms that combine convex subproblems with rounding steps, as in relaxing and rounding schemes. Unlike existing analyses that may only provide local guarantees under limited conditions, our framework delivers global worst-case guarantees--quantifying how well an SCP algorithm performs across all problem instances in the specified family. Applications in control, signal processing, and operations research demonstrate that our framework provides, for the first time, global worst-case guarantees for SCP algorithms in the parametric setting."}

Each pull of an arm provides reward that increases monotonically with diminishing returns. A growing line of work has designed algorithms for improving bandits, albeit with somewhat pessimistic worst-case guarantees. Indeed, strong lower bounds of $Ω(k)$ and $Ω(\\sqrt{k})$ multiplicative approximation factors are known for both deterministic and randomized algorithms (respectively) relative to the optimal arm, where $k$ is the number of bandit arms. In this work, we propose two new parameterized families of bandit algorithms and bound the sample complexity of learning the near-optimal algorithm from each family using offline data. The first family we define includes the optimal randomized algorithm from prior work. We show that an appropriately chosen algorithm from this family can achieve stronger guarantees, with optimal dependence on $k$, when the arm reward curves satisfy additional properties related to the strength of concavity. Our second family contains algorithms that both guarantee best-arm identification on well-behaved instances and revert to worst case guarantees on poorly-behaved instances. Taking a statistical learning perspective on the bandit rewards optimization problem, we achieve stronger data-dependent guarantees without the need for actually verifying whether the assumptions are satisfied."}
