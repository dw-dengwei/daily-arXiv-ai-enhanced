The system leverages four specialized agents that work together to generate contextually appropriate educational content. Experimental validation on platforms including Raspberry Pi 4B and NVIDIA Jetson Nano demonstrates significant performance achievements. InkubaLM on Jetson Nano achieved a Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) of 129 ms, an average inter-token latency of 33 ms, and a throughput of 45.2 tokens per second while consuming 8.4 W. On Raspberry Pi 4B, InkubaLM also led with 326 ms TTFT and 15.9 tokens per second at 5.8 W power consumption. The framework consistently delivered high multilingual quality, averaging a BLEU score of 0.688, cultural relevance of 4.4/5, and fluency of 4.2/5 across tested African languages. Through potential partnerships with active community organizations including African Youth & Community Organization (AYCO) and Florida Africa Foundation, this research aims to establish a practical foundation for accessible, localized, and sustainable AI-driven education in resource-constrained environments.

However, numerous technical reports indicate that purely rule-based reward RL frequently results in poor-quality reasoning chains or inconsistencies between reasoning processes and final answers, particularly when the base model is of smaller scale. During the RL exploration process, models might employ low-quality reasoning chains due to the lack of knowledge, occasionally producing correct answers randomly and receiving rewards based on established rule-based judges. This constrains the potential for resource-limited organizations to conduct direct reinforcement learning training on smaller-scale models. We propose a novel confidence-based reward model tailored for enhancing STEM reasoning capabilities. Unlike conventional approaches, our model penalizes not only incorrect answers but also low-confidence correct responses, thereby promoting more robust and logically consistent reasoning. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through static evaluations, Best-of-N inference tests, and PPO-based RL training.

Current solutions, which have evolved from retrieval using semantic embeddings to more sophisticated structured knowledge graphs representations for improved sense-making and associativity, are tailored for fact-based retrieval and fail to build the space-time-anchored narrative representations required for tracking entities through episodic events. To bridge this gap, we propose the \\textbf{Generative Semantic Workspace} (GSW), a neuro-inspired generative memory framework that builds structured, interpretable representations of evolving situations, enabling LLMs to reason over evolving roles, actions, and spatiotemporal contexts. Our framework comprises an \\textit{Operator}, which maps incoming observations to intermediate semantic structures, and a \\textit{Reconciler}, which integrates these into a persistent workspace that enforces temporal, spatial, and logical coherence. On the Episodic Memory Benchmark (EpBench) \\cite{huet_episodic_2025} comprising corpora ranging from 100k to 1M tokens in length, GSW outperforms existing RAG based baselines by up to \\textbf{20\\%}. Furthermore, GSW is highly efficient, reducing query-time context tokens by \\textbf{51\\%} compared to the next most token-efficient baseline, reducing inference time costs considerably.

While satellite-based imaging spectrometers, such as EMIT, PRISMA, and EnMAP, can detect these point sources, current methane retrieval methods based on matched filters still produce a high number of false detections requiring laborious manual verification. This paper describes the operational deployment of a machine learning system for detecting methane emissions within the Methane Alert and Response System (MARS) of the United Nations Environment Programme's International Methane Emissions Observatory. We created the largest and most diverse global dataset of annotated methane plumes from three imaging spectrometer missions and quantitatively compared different deep learning model configurations. Focusing on the requirements for operational deployment, we extended prior evaluation methodologies from small tiled datasets to full granule evaluation. This revealed that deep learning models still produce a large number of false detections, a problem we address with model ensembling, which reduced false detections by over 74%. Deployed in the MARS pipeline, our system processes scenes and proposes plumes to analysts, accelerating the detection and analysis process. During seven months of operational deployment, it facilitated the verification of 1,351 distinct methane leaks, resulting in 479 stakeholder notifications. We further demonstrate the model's utility in verifying mitigation success through case studies in Libya, Argentina, Oman, and Azerbaijan.

Our core finding is that when the behavior policy is factorized - a common scenario where agents act fully or partially independently during data collection - a strategy of partial action replacement (PAR) can significantly mitigate this challenge. PAR updates a single or part of agents' actions while the others remain fixed to the behavioral data, reducing distribution shift compared to full joint-action updates. Based on this insight, we develop Soft-Partial Conservative Q-Learning (SPaCQL), using PAR to mitigate OOD issue and dynamically weighting different PAR strategies based on the uncertainty of value estimation. We provide a rigorous theoretical foundation for this approach, proving that under factorized behavior policies, the induced distribution shift scales linearly with the number of deviating agents rather than exponentially with the joint-action space. This yields a provably tighter value error bound for this important class of offline MARL problems. Our theoretical results also indicate that SPaCQL adaptively addresses distribution shift using uncertainty-informed weights. Our empirical results demonstrate SPaCQL enables more effective policy learning, and manifest its remarkable superiority over baseline algorithms when the offline dataset exhibits the independence structure.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSPaCQL\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u90e8\u5206\u52a8\u4f5c\u66ff\u6362\u7b56\u7565\u7f13\u89e3\u79bb\u7ebf\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u56e0\u5b50\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\u7b56\u7565\u4e0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u7d27\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\u3002", "motivation": "\u79bb\u7ebf\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u9762\u4e34\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u8054\u5408\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u4e25\u91cd\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u884c\u4e3a\u7b56\u7565\u56e0\u5b50\u5316\u7684\u5e38\u89c1\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1Soft-Partial Conservative Q-Learning (SPaCQL)\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u90e8\u5206\u52a8\u4f5c\u66ff\u6362\u7b56\u7565\u7f13\u89e3OOD\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u6839\u636e\u4ef7\u503c\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u52a8\u6001\u52a0\u6743\u4e0d\u540cPAR\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u56e0\u5b50\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\u7b56\u7565\u4e0b\uff0c\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u968f\u504f\u79bb\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6570\u91cf\u7ebf\u6027\u589e\u957f\u800c\u975e\u968f\u8054\u5408\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u6307\u6570\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u7d27\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\u3002", "conclusion": "SPaCQL\u80fd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u8fdb\u884c\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5728\u79bb\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5448\u73b0\u72ec\u7acb\u7ed3\u6784\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002"}}

At the same time, regulations such as the EU AI Act mandate that each synthetic passage carry an imperceptible, machine-verifiable mark for provenance. Conventional logit-based watermarks satisfy this requirement by selecting a pseudorandom green vocabulary at every decoding step and boosting its logits, yet the random split can exclude the highest-probability token and thus erode fluency. WaterMod mitigates this limitation through a probability-aware modular rule. The vocabulary is first sorted in descending model probability; the resulting ranks are then partitioned by the residue rank mod k, which distributes adjacent-and therefore semantically similar-tokens across different classes. A fixed bias of small magnitude is applied to one selected class. In the zero-bit setting (k=2), an entropy-adaptive gate selects either the even or the odd parity as the green list. Because the top two ranks fall into different parities, this choice embeds a detectable signal while guaranteeing that at least one high-probability token remains available for sampling. In the multi-bit regime (k>2), the current payload digit d selects the color class whose ranks satisfy rank mod k = d. Biasing the logits of that class embeds exactly one base-k digit per decoding step, thereby enabling fine-grained provenance tracing. The same modular arithmetic therefore supports both binary attribution and rich payloads. Experimental results demonstrate that WaterMod consistently attains strong watermark detection performance while maintaining generation quality in both zero-bit and multi-bit settings. This robustness holds across a range of tasks, including natural language generation, mathematical reasoning, and code synthesis.

To address limitations of traditional crime linkage methods in handling high-dimensional, sparse, and heterogeneous data, we propose a Siamese Autoencoder framework that learns meaningful latent representations and uncovers correlations in complex crime data. Using data from the Violent Crime Linkage Analysis System (ViCLAS), maintained by the Serious Crime Analysis Section of the UK's National Crime Agency, our approach mitigates signal dilution in sparse feature spaces by integrating geographic-temporal features at the decoder stage.

We further analyze how different domain-informed data reduction strategies influence model performance, providing practical guidance for preprocessing in crime linkage contexts.

Despite growing interest in brain-computer interface technologies, relatively little attention has been paid to developing EEG-based communication support systems tailored for aphasic patients. To address this gap, we recruited a single participant with expressive aphasia and conducted an Korean-based automatic speech task. EEG signals were recorded during task performance, and each trial was labeled as either correct or incorrect depending on whether the intended word was successfully spoken. Spectral analysis revealed distinct neural activation patterns between the two trial types: misarticulated trials exhibited excessive delta power across widespread channels and increased theta-alpha activity in frontal regions. Building upon these findings, we developed a soft multitask learning framework with maximum mean discrepancy regularization that focus on delta features to jointly optimize class discrimination while aligning the EEG feature distributions of correct and misarticulated trials. The proposed model achieved 58.6 % accuracy for correct and 45.5 % for misarticulated trials-outperforming the baseline by over 45 % on the latter-demonstrating robust intention decoding even under articulation errors.

This paper introduces a novel Character-Level Autoencoder (CAE) approach that automatically identifies and groups semantically identical columns in non-semantic relational datasets by detecting column similarities based on data patterns and structures. Unlike conventional Natural Language Processing (NLP) models that struggle with limitations in semantic interpretability and out-of-vocabulary tokens, our approach operates at the character level with fixed dictionary constraints, enabling scalable processing of large-scale data lakes and warehouses. The CAE architecture encodes text representations of non-semantic relational table columns and extracts high-dimensional feature embeddings for data grouping. By maintaining a fixed dictionary size, our method significantly reduces both memory requirements and training time, enabling efficient processing of large-scale industrial data environments. Experimental evaluation demonstrates substantial performance gains: our CAE approach achieved 80.95% accuracy in top 5 column matching tasks across relational datasets, substantially outperforming traditional NLP approaches such as Bag of Words (47.62%). These results demonstrate its effectiveness for identifying and clustering identical columns in relational datasets.

However, training reliable RMs under limited resources remains challenging due to the reliance on large-scale preference annotations and the high cost of fine-tuning LLMs. To address this, we propose SparseRM, which leverages Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) to extract preference-relevant information encoded in model representations, enabling the construction of a lightweight and interpretable reward model. SparseRM first employs SAE to decompose LLM representations into interpretable directions that capture preference-relevant features. The representations are then projected onto these directions to compute alignment scores, which quantify the strength of each preference feature in the representations. A simple reward head aggregates these scores to predict preference scores. Experiments on three preference modeling tasks show that SparseRM achieves superior performance over most mainstream RMs while using less than 1% of trainable parameters.

Traditional SPICE simulations are time-consuming, while existing machine learning methods often require topology-specific retraining or manual substructure segmentation for fine-tuning, hindering scalability and adaptability. In this work, we propose ZeroSim, a transformer-based performance modeling framework designed to achieve robust in-distribution generalization across trained topologies under novel parameter configurations and zero-shot generalization to unseen topologies without any fine-tuning. We apply three key enabling strategies: (1) a diverse training corpus of 3.6 million instances covering over 60 amplifier topologies, (2) unified topology embeddings leveraging global-aware tokens and hierarchical attention to robustly generalize to novel circuits, and (3) a topology-conditioned parameter mapping approach that maintains consistent structural representations independent of parameter variations. Our experimental results demonstrate that ZeroSim significantly outperforms baseline models such as multilayer perceptrons, graph neural networks and transformers, delivering accurate zero-shot predictions across different amplifier topologies. Additionally, when integrated into a reinforcement learning-based parameter optimization pipeline, ZeroSim achieves a remarkable speedup (13x) compared to conventional SPICE simulations, underscoring its practical value for a wide range of analog circuit design automation tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "ZeroSim\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u7535\u8def\u6027\u80fd\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5185\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u5b9e\u73b0\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfSPICE\u4eff\u771f\u8017\u65f6\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u62d3\u6251\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u624b\u52a8\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u5206\u5272\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u79cd\u5173\u952e\u7b56\u7565\uff1a(1)\u5305\u542b360\u4e07\u4e2a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7684\u591a\u6837\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\uff0c\u8986\u76d660\u591a\u79cd\u653e\u5927\u5668\u62d3\u6251\uff1b(2)\u5229\u7528\u5168\u5c40\u611f\u77e5\u6807\u8bb0\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u62d3\u6251\u5d4c\u5165\uff1b(3)\u62d3\u6251\u6761\u4ef6\u53c2\u6570\u6620\u5c04\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u72ec\u7acb\u4e8e\u53c2\u6570\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "ZeroSim\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u591a\u5c42\u611f\u77e5\u673a\u3001\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u548cTransformer\u7b49\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u653e\u5927\u5668\u62d3\u6251\u4e0a\u63d0\u4f9b\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u5728\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u53c2\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edfSPICE\u4eff\u771f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8613\u500d\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "conclusion": "ZeroSim\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u7535\u8def\u8bbe\u8ba1\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u7535\u8def\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Most prior explainable AI (XAI) approaches have focused on interpreting and explaining how models make predictions. In contrast, we would like to understand how data can be explained with deep learning model training and propose a novel approach to understand the data via one of the most common media - language - so that humans can easily understand. Our approach proposes a pipeline to generate textual descriptions that can explain the data with large language models by incorporating external knowledge bases. However, generated data descriptions may still include irrelevant information, so we introduce to exploit influence estimation to choose the most informative textual descriptions, along with the CLIP score. Furthermore, based on the phenomenon of cross-modal transferability, we propose a novel benchmark task named cross-modal transfer classification to examine the effectiveness of our textual descriptions. In the experiment of zero-shot setting, we show that our textual descriptions are more effective than other baseline descriptions, and furthermore, we successfully boost the performance of the model trained only on images across all nine image classification datasets.

Accepted for publication at the Journal of Machine Learning for Biomedical Imaging (MELBA) https://melba-journal.org/2025:027", "summary": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) models have demonstrated expert-level performance in melanoma detection, yet their clinical adoption is hindered by performance disparities across demographic subgroups such as gender, race, and age. Previous efforts to benchmark the performance of AI models have primarily focused on assessing model performance using group fairness metrics that rely on the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC), which does not provide insights into a model's ability to provide accurate estimates. In line with clinical assessments, this paper addresses this gap by incorporating calibration as a complementary benchmarking metric to AUROC-based fairness metrics. Calibration evaluates the alignment between predicted probabilities and observed event rates, offering deeper insights into subgroup biases. We assess the performance of the leading skin cancer detection algorithm of the ISIC 2020 Challenge on the ISIC 2020 Challenge dataset and the PROVE-AI dataset, and compare it with the second and third place models, focusing on subgroups defined by sex, race (Fitzpatrick Skin Tone), and age. Our findings reveal that while existing models enhance discriminative accuracy, they often over-diagnose risk and exhibit calibration issues when applied to new datasets. This study underscores the necessity for comprehensive model auditing strategies and extensive metadata collection to achieve equitable AI-driven healthcare solutions.

This is especially a concern in vision-based environments where minor manipulations of high-dimensional image inputs can easily mislead the agent's behavior. To this end, various defenses have been proposed recently, with state-of-the-art approaches achieving robust performance even under large state perturbations. However, after closer investigation, we found that the effectiveness of the current defenses is due to a fundamental weakness of the existing $l_p$ norm-constrained attacks, which can barely alter the semantics of image input even under a relatively large perturbation budget. In this work, we propose SHIFT, a novel policy-agnostic diffusion-based state perturbation attack to go beyond this limitation. Our attack is able to generate perturbed states that are semantically different from the true states while remaining realistic and history-aligned to avoid detection. Evaluations show that our attack effectively breaks existing defenses, including the most sophisticated ones, significantly outperforming existing attacks while being more perceptually stealthy. The results highlight the vulnerability of RL agents to semantics-aware adversarial perturbations, indicating the importance of developing more robust policies.", "AI": {"tldr": "SHIFT\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u65e0\u5173\u72b6\u6001\u6270\u52a8\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7834\u89e3\u73b0\u6709RL\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709RL\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfl_p\u8303\u6570\u7ea6\u675f\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u653b\u51fb\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u5927\u6270\u52a8\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u4e5f\u96be\u4ee5\u6539\u53d8\u56fe\u50cf\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSHIFT\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0d\u540c\u4f46\u4fdd\u6301\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u5386\u53f2\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u88ab\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793aSHIFT\u653b\u51fb\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7834\u89e3\u5305\u62ec\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u9632\u5fa1\u5728\u5185\u7684\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u9690\u853d\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "RL\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5bf9\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u5bf9\u6297\u6270\u52a8\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u3002"}}

However, traditional simulation-based optimization methods have long been plagued by significant limitations: they are typically capable of optimizing only a single problem at a time and require substantial computational time for meshing and numerical simulation. This paper introduces a novel framework leveraging cutting-edge Scientific Machine Learning (Sci-ML) methodologies to overcome these inherent drawbacks of conventional approaches. The proposed method provides instantaneous solutions to a spectrum of complex, multidimensional optimization problems. A micromixer case study is employed to demonstrate this methodology. An agent, operating on a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) architecture, serves as the optimizer to explore the relationships between key problem parameters. This optimizer interacts with an environment constituted by a parametric Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN), which responds to the agent's actions at a significantly higher speed than traditional numerical methods. The agent's objective, conditioned on the Schmidt number is to discover the optimal geometric and physical parameters that maximize the micromixer's efficiency. After training the agent across a wide range of Schmidt numbers, we analyzed the resulting optimal designs. Across this entire spectrum, the achieved efficiency was consistently greater than the baseline, normalized value. The maximum efficiency occurred at a Schmidt number of 13.3, demonstrating an improvement of approximately 32%.

Yet existing studies on mathematics problem generation have focused on data augmentation for training neural language models rather than on direct educational deployment. To bridge this gap, we define a new task, Isomorphic Math Problem Generation (IMPG), designed to produce structurally consistent variants of source problems. Subsequently, we explored LLM-based frameworks for automatic IMPG through successive refinements, and established Computational Blueprints for Isomorphic Twins (CBIT). With meta-level generation and template-based selective variation, CBIT achieves high mathematical correctness and structural consistency while reducing the cost of generation. Empirical results across refinements demonstrate that CBIT is superior on generation accuracy and cost-effectiveness at scale.

Our method begins by dividing the service area into zones that group regions with similar temporal patterns of vehicle presence and service demand, allowing the application of discrete optimization methods. In the next stage, we propose a fast ranking-based algorithm that makes its decisions on the basis of the number of cars available in each zone, the projected probability density of demand, and estimated trip durations. The experiments were carried out on the basis of real-world data originating from a major car-sharing service operator in Poland. The results of this algorithm are evaluated against scenarios without optimization that constitute a baseline and compared with the results of an exact algorithm to solve the Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model. As performance metrics, the total travel time was used. Under identical conditions (number of vehicles, staff, and demand distribution), the average improvements with respect to the baseline of our algorithm and MIP solver were equal to 8.44\\% and 19.6\\% correspondingly. However, it should be noted that the MIP model also mimicked decisions on trip selection, which are excluded by current services business rules. The analysis of results suggests that, depending on the size of the workforce, the application of the proposed solution allows for improving performance metrics by roughly 3%-10%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u533a\u57df\u5212\u5206\u548c\u5feb\u901f\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u8f66\u8f86\u91cd\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u81ea\u7531\u6d41\u52a8\u6c7d\u8f66\u5171\u4eab\u670d\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8f66\u8f86\u8c03\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u6ed1\u677f\u8f66\u8fdb\u884c\u4eba\u5458\u8f6c\u79fb\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e863%-10%\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u81ea\u7531\u6d41\u52a8\u6c7d\u8f66\u5171\u4eab\u670d\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8f66\u8f86\u91cd\u5b9a\u4f4d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u8f66\u8f86\u548c\u4eba\u5458\u7684\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u670d\u52a1\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e0d\u540c\u533a\u57df\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6a21\u5f0f\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u5c06\u670d\u52a1\u533a\u57df\u5212\u5206\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u4f3c\u65f6\u95f4\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5feb\u901f\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u6bcf\u4e2a\u533a\u57df\u7684\u53ef\u7528\u8f66\u8f86\u6570\u91cf\u3001\u9700\u6c42\u6982\u7387\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u884c\u7a0b\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u51b3\u7b56\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u65e0\u4f18\u5316\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u5e73\u5747\u6539\u8fdb8.44%\uff0cMIP\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u6539\u8fdb19.6%\uff0c\u4f46MIP\u6a21\u578b\u5305\u542b\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u4e1a\u52a1\u89c4\u5219\u6392\u9664\u7684\u884c\u7a0b\u9009\u62e9\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u80fd\u591f\u6839\u636e\u4eba\u5458\u89c4\u6a21\u5c06\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u63d0\u9ad8\u7ea63%-10%\uff0c\u4e3a\u6c7d\u8f66\u5171\u4eab\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u8f66\u8f86\u91cd\u5b9a\u4f4d\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Our framework focuses on practicality, demonstrating extensibility beyond wired EEG devices to portable, wireless hardware. A user identification module recognizes the operator and provides a personalized, user-specific service. To achieve seamless, real-time operation, we utilize the lab streaming layer to manage the continuous streaming of live EEG signals to the personalized decoder.

The key question is how to estimate the temporal distance between pairs of observations. While temporal difference methods leverage local updates to provide optimality guarantees, they often perform worse than Monte Carlo methods that perform global updates (e.g., with multi-step returns), which lack such guarantees. We show how these approaches can be integrated into a practical GCRL method that fits a quasimetric distance using a multistep Monte-Carlo return. We show our method outperforms existing GCRL methods on long-horizon simulated tasks with up to 4000 steps, even with visual observations.

Extended version with full Appendix", "summary": "Efficient retrieval of external knowledge bases and web pages is crucial for enhancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs. Previous works on training LLMs to leverage external retrievers for solving complex problems have predominantly employed end-to-end reinforcement learning. However, these approaches neglect supervision over the reasoning process, making it difficult to guarantee logical coherence and rigor. To address these limitations, we propose Thinker, a hierarchical thinking model for deep search through multi-turn interaction, making the reasoning process supervisable and verifiable. It decomposes complex problems into independently solvable sub-problems, each dually represented in both natural language and an equivalent logical function to support knowledge base and web searches. Concurrently, dependencies between sub-problems are passed as parameters via these logical functions, enhancing the logical coherence of the problem-solving process. To avoid unnecessary external searches, we perform knowledge boundary determination to check if a sub-problem is within the LLM's intrinsic knowledge, allowing it to answer directly. Experimental results indicate that with as few as several hundred training samples, the performance of Thinker is competitive with established baselines. Furthermore, when scaled to the full training set, Thinker significantly outperforms these methods across various datasets and model sizes.

Existing approaches often rely on either full graph topology-impractical for large or partially observed graphs-or incremental exploration, which can lead to slow convergence. We introduce a scalable framework for global optimization over graphs that employs low-rank spectral representations to build Gaussian process (GP) surrogates from sparse structural observations.

A major challenge lies in modeling the intrinsic stochasticity of temporal dynamics, as real-world sequences often exhibit random fluctuations and localized variations. While diffusion models have achieved remarkable success, their generation process is computationally inefficient, often requiring hundreds to thousands of expensive function evaluations per sample. Flow matching has emerged as a more efficient paradigm, yet its conventional ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based formulation fails to explicitly capture stochasticity, thereby limiting the fidelity of generated sequences. By contrast, stochastic differential equation (SDE) are naturally suited for modeling randomness and uncertainty. Motivated by these insights, we propose TimeFlow, a novel SDE-based flow matching framework that integrates a encoder-only architecture. Specifically, we design a component-wise decomposed velocity field to capture the multi-faceted structure of time series and augment the vanilla flow-matching optimization with an additional stochastic term to enhance representational expressiveness. TimeFlow is flexible and general, supporting both unconditional and conditional generation tasks within a unified framework.

Existing unsupervised RLVR methods, including pure entropy minimization, can overfit to incorrect labels and limit the crucial reward ranking signal for Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). To address these challenges and enhance noise tolerance, we propose a novel two-stage, token-level entropy optimization method for RLVR. This approach dynamically guides the model from exploration to exploitation during training. In the initial exploration phase, token-level entropy maximization promotes diverse and stochastic output generation, serving as a strong regularizer that prevents premature convergence to noisy labels and ensures sufficient intra-group variation, which enables more reliable reward gradient estimation in GRPO. As training progresses, the method transitions into the exploitation phase, where token-level entropy minimization encourages the model to produce confident and deterministic outputs, thereby consolidating acquired knowledge and refining prediction accuracy.

Addressing these challenges, we introduce VersAtile and Risk-Sensitive cardiac diagnosis (VARS), an innovative approach that employs a graph-based representation to uniformly model heterogeneous ECG signals. VARS stands out by transforming ECG signals into versatile graph structures that capture critical diagnostic features, irrespective of signal diversity in the lead count, sampling frequency, and duration. This graph-centric formulation also enhances diagnostic sensitivity, enabling precise localization and identification of abnormal ECG patterns that often elude standard analysis methods. To facilitate representation transformation, our approach integrates denoising reconstruction with contrastive learning to preserve raw ECG information while highlighting pathognomonic patterns. We rigorously evaluate the efficacy of VARS on three distinct ECG datasets, encompassing a range of structural variations. The results demonstrate that VARS not only consistently surpasses existing state-of-the-art models across all these datasets but also exhibits substantial improvement in identifying risk signals. Additionally, VARS offers interpretability by pinpointing the exact waveforms that lead to specific model outputs, thereby assisting clinicians in making informed decisions.

We show how to extend the last-iterate convergence theory of schedule-free to allow for any scheduler, and how the averaging parameter has to be updated as a function of the learning rate. We then perform experiments showing how our convergence theory has some predictive power with regards to practical executions on deep neural networks, despite that this theory relies on assuming convexity. When applied to the warmup-stable-decay (wsd) schedule, our theory shows the optimal convergence rate of $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt{T})$. We then use convexity to design a new adaptive Polyak learning rate schedule for schedule-free. We prove an optimal anytime last-iterate convergence for our new Polyak schedule, and show that it performs well compared to a number of baselines on a black-box model distillation task.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u65e0\u8c03\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4efb\u610f\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u81ea\u9002\u5e94Polyak\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u65e0\u8c03\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u7406\u8bba\u53ea\u652f\u6301\u6052\u5b9a\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u70ed\u8c03\u5ea6\u3002\u9700\u8981\u6269\u5c55\u7406\u8bba\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u4efb\u610f\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u7406\u89e3\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u53d8\u5316\u5bf9\u6536\u655b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u6269\u5c55\u65e0\u8c03\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6700\u540e\u8fed\u4ee3\u6536\u655b\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u4f7f\u7528\u4efb\u610f\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u5bfc\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u4e0e\u5e73\u5747\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u51f8\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94Polyak\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u8c03\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u5728wsd\u8c03\u5ea6\u4e0b\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u6536\u655b\u7387O(1/\u221aT)\u3002\u65b0Polyak\u8c03\u5ea6\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u84b8\u998f\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6269\u5c55\u540e\u7684\u65e0\u8c03\u5ea6\u7406\u8bba\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u65b0\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94Polyak\u8c03\u5ea6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u4efb\u610f\u65f6\u95f4\u6700\u540e\u8fed\u4ee3\u6536\u655b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Our approach yields explainable counterfactuals in a non-generative manner by quantifying similarity and weighting component contributions within regions of interest between correctly classified and misclassified samples.

This scaling enables previously prohibitive analyses, and we perform two real-world, large-scale new studies of interest to political scientists: we provide the first thorough analysis of the evolution of the #MeToo movement through the lens of over two years of Twitter conversation and a detailed study of social media conversations about election fraud in the 2020 presidential election. Thus this method provides social scientists with the ability to study very large corpora at scale and to answer important theoretically-relevant questions about salient issues in near real-time.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u6570\u5341\u4ebf\u6587\u6863\u7684\u4e3b\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5TLDA\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u53c2\u6570\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u548c\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709LDA\u65b9\u6cd5\u5feb3-4\u500d\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86GPU\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4e3b\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u8d85\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u793e\u4f1a\u79d1\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u6d77\u91cf\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u7684\u5206\u6790\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTensor Latent Dirichlet Allocation (TLDA)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5f20\u91cf\u5206\u89e3\u6280\u672f\u786e\u4fdd\u53c2\u6570\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u53ef\u6062\u590d\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0GPU\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5305\u542b\u8d85\u8fc710\u4ebf\u6587\u6863\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7ebf\u6027\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u901f\u5ea6\u6bd4\u5e76\u884cLDA\u65b9\u6cd5\u5feb3-4\u500d\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e#MeToo\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c2020\u5927\u9009\u821e\u5f0a\u7b49\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u5206\u6790\u3002", "conclusion": "TLDA\u4e3a\u793e\u4f1a\u79d1\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5728\u63a5\u8fd1\u5b9e\u65f6\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5206\u6790\u8d85\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u56de\u7b54\u5173\u4e8e\u91cd\u8981\u793e\u4f1a\u8bae\u9898\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u76f8\u5173\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

The problem is complex due to the intricate spatial and temporal interdependence among regions. Prior works study the spatial and temporal dependency in a decouple manner, failing to capture their joint effect. In this work, we propose ST-SAM, a novel and efficient Spatial-Temporal Self-Attention Model for traffic forecasting. ST-SAM uses a region embedding layer to learn time-specific embedding from traffic data for regions. Then, it employs a spatial-temporal dependency learning module based on self-attention mechanism to capture the joint spatial-temporal dependency for both nearby and faraway regions. ST-SAM entirely relies on self-attention to capture both local and global spatial-temporal correlations, which make it effective and efficient. Extensive experiments on two real world datasets show that ST-SAM is substantially more accurate and efficient than the state-of-the-art approaches (with an average improvement of up to 15% on RMSE, 17% on MAPE, and 32 times on training time in our experiments).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faST-SAM\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u8054\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u65f6\u7a7a\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ea4\u901a\u6d41\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u5206\u5f00\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u8054\u5408\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4ea4\u901a\u9884\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u533a\u57df\u5d4c\u5165\u5c42\u5b66\u4e60\u65f6\u95f4\u7279\u5b9a\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4-\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5757\u6355\u83b7\u8054\u5408\u65f6\u7a7a\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cST-SAM\u5728RMSE\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u534715%\uff0cMAPE\u63d0\u534717%\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u5feb32\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "ST-SAM\u901a\u8fc7\u5b8c\u5168\u4f9d\u8d56\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u6709\u6548\u6355\u83b7\u5c40\u90e8\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u65f6\u7a7a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u4ea4\u901a\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

This creates a compelling need for multi-objective bilevel learning (MOBL). So far, however, the field of MOBL remains in its infancy and many important problems remain under-explored. This motivates us to fill this gap and systematically investigate the theoretical and algorithmic foundation of MOBL. Specifically, we consider MOBL problems with multiple conflicting objectives guided by preferences at the upper-level subproblem, where part of the inputs depend on the optimal solution of the lower-level subproblem. Our goal is to develop efficient MOBL optimization algorithms to (1) identify a preference-guided Pareto-stationary solution with low oracle complexity; and (2) enable systematic Pareto front exploration. To this end, we propose a unifying algorithmic framework called weighted-Chebyshev multi-hyper-gradient-descent (WC-MHGD) for both deterministic and stochastic settings with finite-time Pareto-stationarity convergence rate guarantees, which not only implies low oracle complexity but also induces systematic Pareto front exploration. We further conduct extensive experiments to confirm our theoretical results.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u52a0\u6743\u5207\u6bd4\u96ea\u592b\u591a\u8d85\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\uff08WC-MHGD\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u53cc\u5c42\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u968f\u673a\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u90fd\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\u6536\u655b\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5e94\u7528\u65e5\u76ca\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u73b0\u4ee3ML\u6846\u67b6\u9700\u8981\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u540c\u5c42\u95f4\u51b3\u7b56\u53d8\u91cf\u8026\u5408\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u6f5c\u5728\u51b2\u7a81\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u8fd9\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u5bf9\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u53cc\u5c42\u5b66\u4e60\uff08MOBL\uff09\u7684\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u6c42\u3002\u76ee\u524d\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u4ecd\u5904\u4e8e\u8d77\u6b65\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u8bb8\u591a\u91cd\u8981\u95ee\u9898\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u52a0\u6743\u5207\u6bd4\u96ea\u592b\u591a\u8d85\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\uff08WC-MHGD\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u4e0a\u5c42\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7531\u504f\u597d\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u51b2\u7a81\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u90e8\u5206\u8f93\u5165\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u4e0b\u5c42\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u968f\u673a\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u90fd\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\u6536\u655b\u7387\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u610f\u5473\u7740\u4f4eoracle\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u524d\u6cbf\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "conclusion": "WC-MHGD\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u53cc\u5c42\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\u3002"}}

While manually crafting CQs can be highly time-consuming and costly for ontology engineers, recent studies have explored the use of large language models (LLMs) to automate this process. However, prior approaches have largely evaluated generated CQs based on their similarity to existing datasets, which often fail to verify semantic pitfalls such as \"Misusing allValuesFrom\". Since such pitfalls cannot be reliably detected through rule-based methods, we propose a novel dataset and model of Validating Semantic Pitfalls in Ontology (VSPO) for CQ generation specifically designed to verify the semantic pitfalls. To simulate missing and misused axioms, we use LLMs to generate natural language definitions of classes and properties and introduce misalignments between the definitions and the ontology by removing axioms or altering logical operators (e.g., substituting union with intersection). We then fine-tune LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct to generate CQs that validate these semantic discrepancies between the provided definitions and the corresponding axioms. The resulting CQs can detect a broader range of modeling errors compared to existing public datasets. Our fine-tuned model demonstrates superior performance over baselines, showing 26% higher precision and 28.2% higher recall than GPT-4.1 in generating CQs for pitfall validation. This research enables automatic generation of TBox-validating CQs using LLMs, significantly reducing manual effort while improving semantic alignment between ontologies and expert knowledge.

To prove their universal approximation properties, existing works typically rely on model-specific proofs. Generally, they construct a dedicated mathematical formulation for each architecture (e.g., fully connected networks, CNNs, or Transformers) and then prove their universal approximability. However, this approach suffers from two major limitations: first, every newly proposed architecture often requires a completely new proof from scratch; second, these proofs are largely isolated from one another, lacking a common analytical foundation. This not only incurs significant redundancy but also hinders unified theoretical understanding across different network families. To address these issues, this paper proposes a general and modular framework for proving universal approximation. We define a basic building block (comprising one or multiple layers) that possesses the universal approximation property as a Universal Approximation Module (UAM). Under this condition, we show that any deep network composed of such modules inherently retains the universal approximation property. Moreover, the overall approximation process can be interpreted as a progressive refinement across modules.

This problem is particularly important in machine learning involving high-dimensional, multimodal data such as social media, bioinformatics or recommendation systems. Existing Multi-View Multi-Label Feature Selection (MVMLFS) methods mainly focus on analyzing statistical information of data, but seldom consider semantic information. In this paper, we aim to use these two types of information jointly and propose a method that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) semantic reasoning with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) structural modeling for MVMLFS. Specifically, the method consists of three main components. (1) LLM is first used as an evaluation agent to assess the latent semantic relevance among feature, view, and label descriptions. (2) A semantic-aware heterogeneous graph with two levels is designed to represent relations among features, views and labels: one is a semantic graph representing semantic relations, and the other is a statistical graph. (3) A lightweight Graph Attention Network (GAT) is applied to learn node embedding in the heterogeneous graph as feature saliency scores for ranking and selection.

This work investigates a hierarchical and meta-cognitive decoding framework for four-class MI classification. We introduce a multi-scale hierarchical signal processing module that reorganizes backbone features into temporal multi-scale representations, together with an introspective uncertainty estimation module that assigns per-cycle reliability scores and guides iterative refinement. We instantiate this framework on three standard EEG backbones (EEGNet, ShallowConvNet, and DeepConvNet) and evaluate four-class MI decoding using the BCI Competition IV-2a dataset under a subject-independent setting. Across all backbones, the proposed components improve average classification accuracy and reduce inter-subject variance compared to the corresponding baselines, indicating increased robustness to subject heterogeneity and noisy trials. These results suggest that combining hierarchical multi-scale processing with introspective confidence estimation can enhance the reliability of MI-based BCI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u56db\u7c7b\u8fd0\u52a8\u60f3\u8c61\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u548c\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u89e3\u7801\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5206\u5c42\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u548c\u5185\u7701\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8BCI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd0\u52a8\u60f3\u8c61\u7684\u8111\u7535\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e2d\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u8111\u673a\u63a5\u53e3\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u80fd\u529b", "method": "\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5206\u5c42\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u6a21\u5757\u5c06\u4e3b\u5e72\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u7ec4\u4e3a\u65f6\u95f4\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5185\u7701\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u6a21\u5757\u5206\u914d\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5468\u671f\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5206\u6570\u5e76\u6307\u5bfc\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u6807\u51c6EEG\u4e3b\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0a\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7ec4\u4ef6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5e73\u5747\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\u95f4\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5bf9\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u8bd5\u9a8c\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u589e\u5f3a", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u5c42\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5904\u7406\u4e0e\u5185\u7701\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u53ef\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd0\u52a8\u60f3\u8c61\u7684\u8111\u673a\u63a5\u53e3\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027"}}

To explore this issue, we propose a new perturbation framework to evaluate LLMs' reasoning ability in complex environments by injecting additional semantically irrelevant perturbation sentences and gradually increasing the perturbation intensity. At the same time, we use an additional perturbation method: core questioning instruction missing, to further analyze the LLMs' problem-solving mechanism. The experimental results show that LLMs perform stably when facing perturbation sentences without numbers, but there is also a robustness boundary. As the perturbation intensity increases, the performance exhibits varying degrees of decline; when facing perturbation sentences with numbers, the performance decreases more significantly, most open source models with smaller parameters decrease by nearly or even more than 10%, and further increasing with the enhancement of perturbation intensity, with the maximum decrease reaching 51.55%. Even the most advanced commercial LLMs have seen a 3%-10% performance drop. By analyzing the reasoning process of LLMs in detail, We find that models are more sensitive to perturbations with numerical information and are more likely to give incorrect answers when disturbed by irrelevant numerical information. The higher the perturbation intensity, the more obvious these defects are. At the same time, in the absence of core questioning instruction, models can still maintain an accuracy of 20%-40%, indicating that LLMs may rely on memory templates or pattern matching to complete the task, rather than logical reasoning.

To address these challenges, we propose a Knowledge-Augmented Long-CoT Reasoning framework that integrates LLMs with knowledge graph-based multi-hop reasoning chains.

Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis is a fundamental method for formally verifying safety and generating safe controllers. However, computing the HJ value function that characterizes the backward reachable set (BRS) of a set of user-defined failure states is computationally expensive, especially for high-dimensional systems, motivating the use of reinforcement learning approaches to approximate the value function. Unfortunately, a learned value function and its corresponding safe policy are not guaranteed to be correct. The learned value function evaluated at a given state may not be equal to the actual safety return achieved by following the learned safe policy. To address this challenge, we introduce a conformal prediction-based (CP) framework that bounds such uncertainty. We leverage CP to provide probabilistic safety guarantees when using learned HJ value functions and policies to prevent control systems from reaching failure states. Specifically, we use CP to calibrate the switching between the unsafe nominal controller and the learned HJ-based safe policy and to derive safety guarantees under this switched policy. We also investigate using an ensemble of independently trained HJ value functions as a safety filter and compare this ensemble approach to using individual value functions alone.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b66\u4e60\u578bHamilton-Jacobi\u53ef\u8fbe\u6027\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u6982\u7387\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6821\u51c6\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u6807\u79f0\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u7b56\u7565\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5207\u6362\u6765\u9632\u6b62\u7cfb\u7edf\u5230\u8fbe\u6545\u969c\u72b6\u6001\u3002", "motivation": "Hamilton-Jacobi\u53ef\u8fbe\u6027\u5206\u6790\u5728\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b66\u4e60\u578b\u81ea\u4e3b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u867d\u7136\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fd1\u4f3c\u503c\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u4f46\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u76f8\u5e94\u5b89\u5168\u7b56\u7565\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u578bHJ\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7CP\u6821\u51c6\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u6807\u79f0\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u7b56\u7565\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5207\u6362\uff0c\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u72ec\u7acb\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684HJ\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u96c6\u6210\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u4e3a\u4f7f\u7528\u5b66\u4e60\u578bHJ\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u6982\u7387\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u7cfb\u7edf\u5230\u8fbe\u6545\u969c\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5b66\u4e60\u578bHJ\u53ef\u8fbe\u6027\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b66\u4e60\u578b\u81ea\u4e3b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u6982\u7387\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002"}}

RL typically employs reward functions to define task objectives and guide agent learning. However, since the reward function serves the dual purpose of defining the optimal goal and guiding learning, it is challenging to design the reward function manually, which often results in a suboptimal task representation. To tackle the reward design challenge in RL, inspired by the satisficing theory, we propose a Test-driven Reinforcement Learning (TdRL) framework. In the TdRL framework, multiple test functions are used to represent the task objective rather than a single reward function. Test functions can be categorized as pass-fail tests and indicative tests, each dedicated to defining the optimal objective and guiding the learning process, respectively, thereby making defining tasks easier. Building upon such a task definition, we first prove that if a trajectory return function assigns higher returns to trajectories closer to the optimal trajectory set, maximum entropy policy optimization based on this return function will yield a policy that is closer to the optimal policy set. Then, we introduce a lexicographic heuristic approach to compare the relative distance relationship between trajectories and the optimal trajectory set for learning the trajectory return function. Furthermore, we develop an algorithm implementation of TdRL. Experimental results on the DeepMind Control Suite benchmark demonstrate that TdRL matches or outperforms handcrafted reward methods in policy training, with greater design simplicity and inherent support for multi-objective optimization. We argue that TdRL offers a novel perspective for representing task objectives, which could be helpful in addressing the reward design challenges in RL applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08TdRL\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u4e2a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u51fd\u6570\u4ee3\u66ff\u5355\u4e00\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u6765\u5b9a\u4e49\u4efb\u52a1\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u8bbe\u8ba1\u56f0\u96be\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u65e2\u8981\u5b9a\u4e49\u6700\u4f18\u76ee\u6807\u53c8\u8981\u6307\u5bfc\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u624b\u52a8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u56f0\u96be\u4e14\u5f80\u5f80\u5bfc\u81f4\u6b21\u4f18\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u793a\u3002\u53d7\u6ee1\u610f\u7406\u8bba\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u8bd5\u51fd\u6570\u5206\u79bb\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u529f\u80fd\u6765\u7b80\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u5b9a\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u901a\u8fc7-\u5931\u8d25\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u6307\u793a\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5206\u522b\u5b9a\u4e49\u6700\u4f18\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u6307\u5bfc\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f68\u8ff9\u8fd4\u56de\u51fd\u6570\u8bc1\u660e\u6700\u5927\u71b5\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u96c6\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u8bcd\u5178\u5e8f\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4\u8f83\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0e\u6700\u4f18\u8f68\u8ff9\u96c6\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u8ddd\u79bb\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u5728DeepMind Control Suite\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cTdRL\u5728\u7b56\u7565\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0a\u5339\u914d\u6216\u4f18\u4e8e\u624b\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7b80\u5355\u6027\u548c\u5bf9\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u5185\u5728\u652f\u6301\u3002", "conclusion": "TdRL\u4e3a\u8868\u793a\u4efb\u52a1\u76ee\u6807\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

However, the key research question of identifying reasoning steps that balance complexity and computational efficiency remains unsolved. Recent research has increasingly drawn upon psychological theories to explore strategies for optimizing cognitive pathways. The LLM's final outputs and intermediate steps are regarded as System 1 and System 2, respectively. However, an in-depth exploration of the System 2 reasoning is still lacking. Therefore, we propose a novel psychologically backed Scaffold Reasoning framework for code debugging, which encompasses the Scaffold Stream, Analytic Stream, and Integration Stream. The construction of reference code within the Scaffold Stream is integrated with the buggy code analysis results produced by the Analytic Stream through the Integration Stream. Our framework achieves an 88.91% pass rate and an average inference time of 5.36 seconds per-problem on DebugBench, outperforming other reasoning approaches across various LLMs in both reasoning accuracy and efficiency. Further analyses elucidate the advantages and limitations of various cognitive pathways across varying problem difficulties and bug types.

We release 95k training episodes plus two 1k test splits (interpolation/extrapolation) and evaluate symbolic, recurrent, convolutional, transformer, recursive, and LLM baselines. CellARC decouples generalization from anthropomorphic priors, supports unlimited difficulty-controlled sampling, and enables reproducible studies of how quickly models infer new rules under tight budgets. Our strongest small-model baseline (a 10M-parameter vanilla transformer) outperforms recent recursive models (TRM, HRM), reaching 58.0%/32.4% per-token accuracy on the interpolation/extrapolation splits, while a large closed model (GPT-5 High) attains 62.3%/48.1% on subsets of 100 test tasks. An ensemble that chooses per episode between the Transformer and the best symbolic baseline reaches 65.4%/35.5%, highlighting neuro-symbolic complementarity.

Existing methods generally suffer from limited scalability, weak semantic preservation, and high costs. Therefore, we propose MSCR, an automated adversarial attack method based on multi-source candidate replacement. By combining three information sources including cosine similarity in the embedding space of LLMs, the WordNet dictionary, and contextual predictions from a masked language model, we generate for each word in the input question a set of semantically similar candidates, which are then filtered and substituted one by one to carry out the attack. We conduct large-scale experiments on LLMs using the GSM8K and MATH500 benchmarks. The results show that even a slight perturbation involving only a single word can significantly reduce the accuracy of all models, with the maximum drop reaching 49.89% on GSM8K and 35.40% on MATH500, while preserving the high semantic consistency of the perturbed questions. Further analysis reveals that perturbations not only lead to incorrect outputs but also substantially increase the average response length, which results in more redundant reasoning paths and higher computational resource consumption.

The widespread adoption of test-time scaling further aggravates the tension between model capability and resource consumption, highlighting the importance of inference efficiency. However, a unified metric that accurately reflects an LLM's efficiency across different model sizes and architectures remains absent. Motivated by the correlation between compression and intelligence, we introduce information capacity, a measure of model efficiency based on text compression performance relative to computational complexity. Larger models can predict the next token more accurately, achieving greater compression gains but at higher computational costs. Empirical evaluations on mainstream open-source models show that models of varying sizes within a series exhibit consistent information capacity. This metric enables a fair efficiency comparison across model series and accurate performance prediction within a model series. A distinctive feature of information capacity is that it incorporates tokenizer efficiency, which affects both input and output token counts but is often neglected in LLM evaluations.

By preserving detailed critiques instead of compressing them to binary preferences, Feedback Descent widens the information bottleneck in preference learning, enabling directed optimization in text space rather than weight space. We show that in-context learning can transform structured feedback into gradient-like directional information, enabling targeted edits. Unlike prior approaches that collapse judgments into single bits, our evaluators pair each comparison with textual feedback, which functions as high-bandwidth supervision. The iteration loop is done purely at inference time, without modifying any model weights, and is task-agnostic. We evaluate Feedback Descent on three diverse domains and find that it outperforms state-of-the-art prompt optimization (GEPA), reinforcement learning methods (GRPO, REINVENT), and even specialized graph-based molecular optimizers.

Anomaly detection in this type of data constitutes a challenging problem yet with numerous applications in science and engineering because anomaly scores come from the simultaneous consideration of the temporal and variable relationships. In this paper, we propose a clustering-based approach to detect anomalies concerning the amplitude and the shape of multivariate time series. First, we use a sliding window to generate a set of multivariate subsequences and thereafter apply an extended fuzzy clustering to reveal a structure present within the generated multivariate subsequences. Finally, a reconstruction criterion is employed to reconstruct the multivariate subsequences with the optimal cluster centers and the partition matrix. We construct a confidence index to quantify a level of anomaly detected in the series and apply Particle Swarm Optimization as an optimization vehicle for the problem of anomaly detection. Experimental studies completed on several synthetic and six real-world datasets suggest that the proposed methods can detect the anomalies in multivariate time series. With the help of available clusters revealed by the extended fuzzy clustering, the proposed framework can detect anomalies in the multivariate time series and is suitable for identifying anomalous amplitude and shape patterns in various application domains such as health care, weather data analysis, finance, and disease outbreak detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u805a\u7c7b\u7684\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u751f\u6210\u5b50\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6269\u5c55\u6a21\u7cca\u805a\u7c7b\u5206\u6790\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u91cd\u6784\u51c6\u5219\u548c\u7c92\u5b50\u7fa4\u4f18\u5316\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u632f\u5e45\u548c\u5f62\u72b6\u5f02\u5e38\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u4f46\u5e94\u7528\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u53d8\u91cf\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u632f\u5e45\u548c\u5f62\u72b6\u5f02\u5e38\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u751f\u6210\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u5b50\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u6269\u5c55\u6a21\u7cca\u805a\u7c7b\u63ed\u793a\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u91cd\u6784\u51c6\u5219\u91cd\u5efa\u5b50\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u7f6e\u4fe1\u6307\u6570\u91cf\u5316\u5f02\u5e38\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u7c92\u5b50\u7fa4\u4f18\u5316\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5408\u6210\u548c\u516d\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u632f\u5e45\u548c\u5f62\u72b6\u6a21\u5f0f\u5f02\u5e38\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u5c55\u6a21\u7cca\u805a\u7c7b\u63ed\u793a\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u533b\u7597\u3001\u5929\u6c14\u5206\u6790\u3001\u91d1\u878d\u548c\u75be\u75c5\u7206\u53d1\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u3002"}}

However, applying RL to open-domain tasks faces two key challenges: (1) the inherent subjectivity of these tasks prevents the verifiable rewards as required by Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR); (2) Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) relies on external reward mechanisms. To overcome these limitations, we propose Self-Examining Reinforcement Learning (SERL), a novel self-improving framework where the LLM serves as both Actor and Judge. SERL introduces two synergistic reward mechanisms without any external signals. On the one hand, to improve the Actor's capability, we derive rewards from Copeland-style pairwise comparison judgments across a group of generated responses. On the other hand, a self-consistency reward that encourages coherent judgments is proposed to improve the Judge's reliability.

A five-pillar architecture--governance, data lineage, assurance, resilience, and regulatory alignment--translates supervisory expectations from Solvency II, SR 11-7, and guidance from EIOPA (2025), NAIC (2023), and IAIS (2024) into measurable lifecycle controls. The framework is implemented through the Reinsurance AI Reliability and Assurance Benchmark (RAIRAB), which evaluates whether governance-embedded LLMs meet prudential standards for grounding, transparency, and accountability. Across six task families, retrieval-grounded configurations achieved higher grounding accuracy (0.90), reduced hallucination and interpretive drift by roughly 40%, and nearly doubled transparency.

To enhance decision quality, decision-focused learning has been proposed to align forecasting and optimization via end-to-end training. However, most formulations assume a fixed task configuration in downstream optimization, and thus generalize poorly to evolving task structures induced by varying seaport vessel arrivals. We address this gap with a decision-focused continual learning framework that adapts online to a stream of scheduling tasks. Specifically, we introduce Fisher information based regularization to enhance cross-task generalization by preserving parameters critical to prior tasks.

Explainable Artificial Intelligence offers a solution by providing insights into model decision-making and identifying the most relevant features for classification. In this paper, we investigate the impact of feature reduction using XAI techniques on the quality classification of injection-molded parts. We apply SHAP, Grad-CAM, and LIME to analyze feature importance in a Long Short-Term Memory model trained on real production data. By reducing the original 19 input features to 9 and 6, we evaluate the trade-off between model accuracy, inference speed, and interpretability. Our results show that reducing features can improve generalization while maintaining high classification performance, with an small increase in inference speed.

However, standard IL methods implicitly assume that the environment dynamics remain fixed between training and deployment. In practice, this assumption rarely holds where modeling inaccuracies, real-world parameter variations, and adversarial perturbations can all induce shifts in transition dynamics, leading to severe performance degradation. We address this challenge through Balance Equation-based Distributionally Robust Offline Imitation Learning, a framework that learns robust policies solely from expert demonstrations collected under nominal dynamics, without requiring further environment interaction. We formulate the problem as a distributionally robust optimization over an uncertainty set of transition models, seeking a policy that minimizes the imitation loss under the worst-case transition distribution. Importantly, we show that this robust objective can be reformulated entirely in terms of the nominal data distribution, enabling tractable offline learning.

However, existing methods typically assume that unlearning requests arrive all at once, whereas in practice they often arrive sequentially. We present the first systematic study of continual unlearning in text-to-image diffusion models and show that popular unlearning methods suffer from rapid utility collapse: after only a few requests, models forget retained knowledge and generate degraded images. We trace this failure to cumulative parameter drift from the pre-training weights and argue that regularization is crucial to addressing it. To this end, we study a suite of add-on regularizers that (1) mitigate drift and (2) remain compatible with existing unlearning methods. Beyond generic regularizers, we show that semantic awareness is essential for preserving concepts close to the unlearning target, and propose a gradient-projection method that constrains parameter drift orthogonal to their subspace. This substantially improves continual unlearning performance and is complementary to other regularizers for further gains. Taken together, our study establishes continual unlearning as a fundamental challenge in text-to-image generation and provides insights, baselines, and open directions for advancing safe and accountable generative AI.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u8bf7\u6c42\u4e0b\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7528\u5feb\u901f\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u6240\u6709\u9057\u5fd8\u8bf7\u6c42\u540c\u65f6\u5230\u8fbe\uff0c\u800c\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u8bf7\u6c42\u5f80\u5f80\u662f\u987a\u5e8f\u5230\u8fbe\u7684\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u6301\u7eed\u9057\u5fd8\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e00\u5957\u9644\u52a0\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u53c2\u6570\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u68af\u5ea6\u6295\u5f71\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u7ea6\u675f\u53c2\u6570\u5728\u6b63\u4ea4\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u7684\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u9057\u5fd8\u76ee\u6807\u76f8\u8fd1\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u6301\u7eed\u9057\u5fd8\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\u4e92\u8865\u53ef\u83b7\u5f97\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u589e\u76ca\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u9632\u6b62\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u77e5\u8bc6\u9000\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6301\u7eed\u9057\u5fd8\u662f\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u63a8\u8fdb\u5b89\u5168\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u751f\u6210AI\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u89c1\u89e3\u3001\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u5f00\u653e\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Speech-based assessments show promise for early detection, as phonetic motor planning deficits alter acoustic features (e.g., pitch, tone), while memory and language impairments lead to syntactic and semantic errors. However, conventional speech-processing pipelines with hand-crafted features or general-purpose audio classifiers often exhibit limited performance and generalizability. To address these limitations, we introduce SpeechCARE, a multimodal speech processing pipeline that leverages pretrained, multilingual acoustic and linguistic transformer models to capture subtle speech-related cues associated with cognitive impairment. Inspired by the Mixture of Experts (MoE) paradigm, SpeechCARE employs a dynamic fusion architecture that weights transformer-based acoustic, linguistic, and demographic inputs, allowing integration of additional modalities (e.g., social factors, imaging) and enhancing robustness across diverse tasks. Its robust preprocessing includes automatic transcription, large language model (LLM)-based anomaly detection, and task identification. A SHAP-based explainability module and LLM reasoning highlight each modality's contribution to decision-making. SpeechCARE achieved AUC = 0.88 and F1 = 0.72 for classifying cognitively healthy, MCI, and AD individuals, with AUC = 0.90 and F1 = 0.62 for MCI detection. Bias analysis showed minimal disparities, except for adults over 80. Mitigation techniques included oversampling and weighted loss.

We introduce SciAgent, a unified multi-agent system designed for generalistic scientific reasoning-the ability to adapt reasoning strategies across disciplines and difficulty levels. SciAgent organizes problem solving as a hierarchical process: a Coordinator Agent interprets each problem's domain and complexity, dynamically orchestrating specialized Worker Systems, each composed of interacting reasoning Sub-agents for symbolic deduction, conceptual modeling, numerical computation, and verification. These agents collaboratively assemble and refine reasoning pipelines tailored to each task.

Existing expressivity results are often tied to specific design choices and lack comprehensive empirical validation on large-scale data. This leaves a gap between theory and practice, preventing generalizable insights that exceed particular application domains. Here, we propose the Generalized-Distance Transformer (GDT), a GT architecture using standard attention that incorporates many advancements for GTs from recent years, and develop a fine-grained understanding of the GDT's representation power in terms of attention and PEs. Through extensive experiments, we identify design choices that consistently perform well across various applications, tasks, and model scales, demonstrating strong performance in a few-shot transfer setting without fine-tuning. Our evaluation covers over eight million graphs with roughly 270M tokens across diverse domains, including image-based object detection, molecular property prediction, code summarization, and out-of-distribution algorithmic reasoning.

Existing DFL frameworks are limited by their strictly sequential structure, referred to as sequential DFL (S-DFL). However, S-DFL fails to capture the bidirectional feedback between prediction and optimization in complex interaction scenarios. In view of this, we first time propose recursive decision-focused learning (R-DFL), a novel framework that introduces bidirectional feedback between downstream optimization and upstream prediction. We further extend two distinct differentiation methods: explicit unrolling via automatic differentiation and implicit differentiation based on fixed-point methods, to facilitate efficient gradient propagation in R-DFL. We rigorously prove that both methods achieve comparable gradient accuracy, with the implicit method offering superior computational efficiency. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, including the newsvendor problem and the bipartite matching problem, demonstrate that R-DFL not only substantially enhances the final decision quality over sequential baselines but also exhibits robust adaptability across diverse scenarios in closed-loop decision-making problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9012\u5f52\u51b3\u7b56\u805a\u7126\u5b66\u4e60(R-DFL)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4e0b\u6e38\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u4e0a\u6e38\u9884\u6d4b\u4e4b\u95f4\u5f15\u5165\u53cc\u5411\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u987a\u5e8f\u51b3\u7b56\u805a\u7126\u5b66\u4e60(S-DFL)\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u987a\u5e8f\u51b3\u7b56\u805a\u7126\u5b66\u4e60(S-DFL)\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u590d\u6742\u4ea4\u4e92\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u51b3\u7b56\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faR-DFL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u5fae\u5206\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u5c55\u5f00\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b9a\u70b9\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u5fae\u5206\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u4f20\u64ad\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u62a5\u7ae5\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u4e8c\u5206\u56fe\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cR-DFL\u76f8\u6bd4\u987a\u5e8f\u57fa\u7ebf\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6700\u7ec8\u51b3\u7b56\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u95ed\u73af\u51b3\u7b56\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "R-DFL\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u53cc\u5411\u53cd\u9988\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u51b3\u7b56\u805a\u7126\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4ea4\u4e92\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, existing approaches either rely on manually defined action spaces that lack scalability or utilize unstructured spaces that render exhaustive search computationally prohibitive. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named \\textsc{DynaAct} for automatically constructing a compact action space to enhance sequential reasoning in complex problem-solving scenarios. Our method first estimates a proxy for the complete action space by extracting general sketches observed in a corpus covering diverse complex reasoning problems using large language models. We then formulate a submodular function that jointly evaluates candidate actions based on their utility to the current state and their diversity, and employ a greedy algorithm to select an optimal candidate set. Extensive experiments on six diverse standard benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly improves overall performance, while maintaining efficient inference without introducing substantial latency.

These data are often collected from online sources. This raises serious concerns about the protection of user data, as individuals may not have given consent for their data to be used in training. To address this concern, recent studies introduce the concept of unlearnable examples, i.e., data instances that appear natural but are intentionally altered to prevent models from effectively learning from them. While existing methods demonstrate empirical effectiveness, they typically rely on heuristic trials and lack formal guarantees. Besides, when unlearnable examples are mixed with clean data, as is often the case in practice, their unlearnability disappears. In this work, we propose a novel approach to constructing unlearnable examples by systematically maximising the Bayes error, a measurement of irreducible classification error. We develop an optimisation-based approach and provide an efficient solution using projected gradient ascent. Our method provably increases the Bayes error and remains effective when the unlearning examples are mixed with clean samples. Experimental results across multiple datasets and model architectures are consistent with our theoretical analysis and show that our approach can restrict data learnability, effectively in practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u8bef\u5dee\u6700\u5927\u5316\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6837\u672c\u6784\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u589e\u52a0\u5206\u7c7b\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u5e72\u51c0\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u7528\u6237\u6570\u636e\u4fdd\u62a4\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u672a\u7ecf\u540c\u610f\u7684\u6570\u636e\u88ab\u7528\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e14\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u5931\u6548\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u8bef\u5dee\u6700\u5927\u5316\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6295\u5f71\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5347\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u6548\u6c42\u89e3\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u6784\u9020\u4e0d\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6837\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u9650\u5236\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u5e72\u51c0\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u8bef\u5dee\u6700\u5927\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u4e0d\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6837\u672c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

IEEE Transactions on Artificial Intelligence (2024)", "summary": "The integration of different learning paradigms has long been a focus of machine learning research, aimed at overcoming the inherent limitations of individual methods. Fuzzy rule-based models excel in interpretability and have seen widespread application across diverse fields. However, they face challenges such as complex design specifications and scalability issues with large datasets. The fusion of different techniques and strategies, particularly Gradient Boosting, with Fuzzy Rule-Based Models offers a robust solution to these challenges. This paper proposes an Integrated Fusion Framework that merges the strengths of both paradigms to enhance model performance and interpretability. At each iteration, a Fuzzy Rule-Based Model is constructed and controlled by a dynamic factor to optimize its contribution to the overall ensemble. This control factor serves multiple purposes: it prevents model dominance, encourages diversity, acts as a regularization parameter, and provides a mechanism for dynamic tuning based on model performance, thus mitigating the risk of overfitting. Additionally, the framework incorporates a sample-based correction mechanism that allows for adaptive adjustments based on feedback from a validation set. Experimental results substantiate the efficacy of the presented gradient boosting framework for fuzzy rule-based models, demonstrating performance enhancement, especially in terms of mitigating overfitting and complexity typically associated with many rules. By leveraging an optimal factor to govern the contribution of each model, the framework improves performance, maintains interpretability, and simplifies the maintenance and update of the models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u96c6\u6210\u878d\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u68af\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u4e0e\u6a21\u7cca\u89c4\u5219\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u63a7\u5236\u56e0\u5b50\u548c\u6837\u672c\u6821\u6b63\u673a\u5236\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u9632\u6b62\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6a21\u7cca\u89c4\u5219\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u8bbe\u8ba1\u590d\u6742\u548c\u5927\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u68af\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u5f3a\u5927\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u878d\u5408\u4e24\u8005\u53ef\u4ee5\u514b\u670d\u5404\u81ea\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "method": "\u96c6\u6210\u878d\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5728\u6bcf\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u4e2d\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u7cca\u89c4\u5219\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u63a7\u5236\u56e0\u5b50\u4f18\u5316\u5176\u5728\u6574\u4f53\u96c6\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u8be5\u56e0\u5b50\u9632\u6b62\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u5bfc\u3001\u9f13\u52b1\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3001\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u96c6\u53cd\u9988\u8fdb\u884c\u6837\u672c\u6821\u6b63\u8c03\u6574\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u7cca\u89c4\u5219\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u51cf\u8f7b\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u548c\u89c4\u5219\u590d\u6742\u6027\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u63a7\u5236\u56e0\u5b50\u6765\u7ba1\u7406\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8fd8\u7ef4\u6301\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7ef4\u62a4\u548c\u66f4\u65b0\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002"}}

Recent advances in artificial intelligence, particularly large language models (LLMs), have enabled virtual screening methods that reduce costs and improve efficiency. However, the growing complexity of these tools has limited their accessibility to wet-lab researchers. Multi-agent systems offer a promising solution by combining the interpretability of LLMs with the precision of specialized models and tools. In this work, we present MADD, a multi-agent system that builds and executes customized hit identification pipelines from natural language queries. MADD employs four coordinated agents to handle key subtasks in de novo compound generation and screening.

We propose \\textbf{Geometric Action Control (GAC)}, a novel action generation paradigm that preserves the geometric benefits of spherical distributions while \\textit{simplifying computation}. GAC decomposes action generation into a direction vector and a learnable concentration parameter, enabling efficient interpolation between deterministic actions and uniform spherical noise. This design reduces parameter count from \\(2d\\) to \\(d+1\\), and avoids the \\(O(dk)\\) complexity of vMF rejection sampling, achieving simple \\(O(d)\\) operations. Empirically, GAC consistently matches or exceeds state-of-the-art methods across six MuJoCo benchmarks, achieving 37.6\\% improvement over SAC on Ant-v4 and the best results on 4 out of 6 tasks. Our ablation studies reveal that both \\textbf{spherical normalization} and \\textbf{adaptive concentration control} are essential to GAC's success.

To address the difficulty of mapping AI algorithms to hardware, recent work proposes C++ embedded and PyTorch-inspired domain-specific languages like ThunderKittens (TK) to simplify high performance AI kernel development on NVIDIA hardware. We explore the extent to which such primitives -- for explicit tile-based programming with optimized memory accesses and fine-grained asynchronous execution across workers -- are NVIDIA-specific or general. We provide the first detailed study of the programming primitives that lead to performant AMD AI kernels, and we encapsulate these insights in the HipKittens (HK) programming framework. We find that tile-based abstractions used in prior DSLs generalize to AMD GPUs, however we need to rethink the algorithms that instantiate these abstractions for AMD. We validate the HK primitives across CDNA3 and CDNA4 AMD platforms. In evaluations, HK kernels compete with AMD's hand-optimized assembly kernels for GEMMs and attention, and consistently outperform compiler baselines. Moreover, assembly is difficult to scale to the breadth of AI workloads; reflecting this, in some settings HK outperforms all available kernel baselines by $1.2-2.4\\times$ (e.g., $d=64$ attention, GQA backwards, memory-bound kernels). These findings help pave the way for a single, tile-based software layer for high-performance AI kernels that translates across GPU vendors.

These metrics fail to capture the quality of an agent's decisions, its operational autonomy, or its ultimate business value. This white paper proposes a novel, comprehensive framework of eleven outcome-based, task-agnostic performance metrics for AI agents that transcend domain boundaries. These metrics are designed to enable organizations to evaluate agents based on the quality of their decisions, their degree of autonomy, their adaptability to new challenges, and the tangible business value they deliver, regardless of the underlying model architecture or specific use case. We introduce metrics such as Goal Completion Rate (GCR), Autonomy Index (AIx), Multi-Step Task Resilience (MTR), and Business Impact Efficiency (BIE). Through a large-scale simulated experiment involving four distinct agent architectures (ReAct, Chain-of-Thought, Tool-Augmented, Hybrid) across five diverse domains (Healthcare, Finance, Marketing, Legal, and Customer Service), we demonstrate the framework's efficacy. Our results reveal significant performance trade-offs between different agent designs, highlighting the Hybrid Agent as the most consistently high-performing model across the majority of our proposed metrics, achieving an average Goal Completion Rate of 88.8\\% and the highest Return on Investment (ROI).

Recent work suggests that the underlying causal graphs of such dynamics models are sparsely connected, with each of the future state variables depending only on a small subset of the current state variables, and that learning may therefore benefit from sparsity priors. Similarly, temporal sparsity, i.e. sparsely and abruptly changing local dynamics, has also been proposed as a useful inductive bias.\n  In this work, we critically examine these assumptions by analyzing ground-truth dynamics from a set of robotic reinforcement learning environments in the MuJoCo Playground benchmark suite, aiming to determine whether the proposed notions of state and temporal sparsity actually tend to hold in typical reinforcement learning tasks.\n  We study (i) whether the causal graphs of environment dynamics are sparse, (ii) whether such sparsity is state-dependent, and (iii) whether local system dynamics change sparsely.\n  Our results indicate that global sparsity is rare, but instead the tasks show local, state-dependent sparsity in their dynamics and this sparsity exhibits distinct structures, appearing in temporally localized clusters (e.g., during contact events) and affecting specific subsets of state dimensions.

To address these challenges, task-vector-based methods have been explored by inserting compact representations of many-shot in-context demonstrations into model activations. However, existing task-vector-based methods either overlook the importance of where to insert task vectors or struggle to determine suitable values for each location. To this end, we propose a novel Sensitivity-aware Task Vector insertion framework (STV) to figure out where and what to insert. Our key insight is that activation deltas across query-context pairs exhibit consistent structural patterns, providing a reliable cue for insertion. Based on the identified sensitive-aware locations, we construct a pre-clustered activation bank for each location by clustering the activation values, and then apply reinforcement learning to choose the most suitable one to insert.

In this work, we introduce the Complex-Valued Stuart-Landau Graph Neural Network (SLGNN), a novel architecture grounded in Stuart-Landau oscillator dynamics. Stuart-Landau oscillators are canonical models of limit-cycle behavior near Hopf bifurcations, which are fundamental to synchronization theory and are widely used in e.g. neuroscience for mesoscopic brain modeling. Unlike harmonic oscillators and phase-only Kuramoto models, Stuart-Landau oscillators retain both amplitude and phase dynamics, enabling rich phenomena such as amplitude regulation and multistable synchronization. The proposed SLGNN generalizes existing phase-centric Kuramoto-based OGNNs by allowing node feature amplitudes to evolve dynamically according to Stuart-Landau dynamics, with explicit tunable hyperparameters (such as the Hopf-parameter and the coupling strength) providing additional control over the interplay between feature amplitudes and network structure. We conduct extensive experiments across node classification, graph classification, and graph regression tasks, demonstrating that SLGNN outperforms existing OGNNs and establishes a novel, expressive, and theoretically grounded framework for deep oscillatory architectures on graphs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eStuart-Landau\u632f\u8361\u5668\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u590d\u503c\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edcSLGNN\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fdd\u7559\u632f\u5e45\u548c\u76f8\u4f4d\u52a8\u6001\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u6df1\u5ea6GNN\u4e2d\u7684\u8fc7\u5e73\u6ed1\u548c\u68af\u5ea6\u6d88\u5931\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u8fc7\u5e73\u6ed1\u548c\u68af\u5ea6\u6d88\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f8\u4f4d\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u632f\u8361\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u632f\u5e45\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eStuart-Landau\u632f\u8361\u5668\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6784\u5efa\u590d\u503c\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u8282\u70b9\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u632f\u5e45\u548c\u76f8\u4f4d\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u8c03\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u63a7\u5236\u7279\u5f81\u632f\u5e45\u4e0e\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8282\u70b9\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u56fe\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u56fe\u56de\u5f52\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSLGNN\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u632f\u8361\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "conclusion": "SLGNN\u4e3a\u56fe\u4e0a\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u632f\u8361\u67b6\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u9896\u3001\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\u5f3a\u4e14\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u575a\u5b9e\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Most existing GraphRAG efforts focus on Resource Description Framework (RDF) knowledge graphs, relying on triple representations and SPARQL queries. However, the potential of Cypher and Labeled Property Graph (LPG) databases to serve as scalable and effective reasoning engines within GraphRAG pipelines remains underexplored in current research literature. To fill this gap, we propose Multi-Agent GraphRAG, a modular LLM agentic system for text-to-Cypher query generation serving as a natural language interface to LPG-based graph data. Our proof-of-concept system features an LLM-based workflow for automated Cypher queries generation and execution, using Memgraph as the graph database backend. Iterative content-aware correction and normalization, reinforced by an aggregated feedback loop, ensures both semantic and syntactic refinement of generated queries. We evaluate our system on the CypherBench graph dataset covering several general domains with diverse types of queries. In addition, we demonstrate performance of the proposed workflow on a property graph derived from the IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) data, representing a digital twin of a building.

We address this by proposing DiagramIR: an automatic and scalable evaluation pipeline for geometric figures. Our method relies on intermediate representations (IRs) of LaTeX TikZ code.

This evaluation approach also enables smaller models like GPT-4.1-Mini to perform comparably to larger models such as GPT-5 at a 10x lower inference cost, which is important for deploying accessible and scalable education technologies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86DiagramIR\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u51e0\u4f55\u56fe\u5f62\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eLaTeX TikZ\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4LLM-as-a-Judge\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4f30\u8005\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u8ba9\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u4ee510\u500d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u8fbe\u5230\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "LLMs\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u7528\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4f46\u5927\u591a\u6570\u5de5\u5177\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u7b49\u9700\u8981\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u7684\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002\u867d\u7136LLMs\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u7f16\u8bd1\u6210\u6559\u80b2\u56fe\u5f62\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u4f46\u4e3b\u8981\u74f6\u9888\u5728\u4e8e\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u56fe\u8868\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDiagramIR\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u5229\u7528LaTeX TikZ\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u8868\u793a(IRs)\u6765\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u51e0\u4f55\u56fe\u5f62\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4f30\u8005\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u9ad8\u4e8eLLM-as-a-Judge\u7b49\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u8ba9GPT-4.1-Mini\u7b49\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u4ee510\u500d\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u8fbe\u5230GPT-5\u7b49\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "DiagramIR\u4e3a\u90e8\u7f72\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6559\u80b2\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u9700\u8981\u89c6\u89c9\u5316\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u9886\u57df\u3002"}}

In many real-world settings, online interactions can be risky, and accurately specifying the reward and the safety cost information at each timestep can be difficult. However, it is often feasible to collect trajectories reflecting undesirable or risky behavior, implicitly conveying the behavior the agent should avoid. We refer to these trajectories as non-preferred trajectories. Unlike standard IL, which aims to mimic demonstrations, our agent must also learn to avoid risky behavior using non-preferred trajectories. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, SafeMIL, to learn a parameterized cost that predicts if the state-action pair is risky via \\textit{Multiple Instance Learning}. The learned cost is then used to avoid non-preferred behaviors, resulting in a policy that prioritizes safety. We empirically demonstrate that our approach can learn a safer policy that satisfies cost constraints without degrading the reward performance, thereby outperforming several baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSafeMIL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u793a\u4f8b\u5b66\u4e60\u4ece\u975e\u504f\u597d\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u6210\u672c\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u79bb\u7ebf\u5b89\u5168\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b89\u5168\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4e0d\u964d\u4f4e\u5956\u52b1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u5728\u7ebf\u4ea4\u4e92\u5b58\u5728\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u7cbe\u786e\u6307\u5b9a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6210\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u4ee5\u6536\u96c6\u53cd\u6620\u4e0d\u826f\u6216\u5371\u9669\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8f68\u8ff9\u9690\u542b\u4f20\u8fbe\u4e86\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5e94\u907f\u514d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u793a\u4f8b\u5b66\u4e60\u4ece\u975e\u504f\u597d\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u6210\u672c\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u72b6\u6001-\u52a8\u4f5c\u5bf9\u662f\u5426\u5371\u9669\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5c06\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u6210\u672c\u7528\u4e8e\u907f\u514d\u975e\u504f\u597d\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u4f18\u5148\u8003\u8651\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5b66\u4e60\u6ee1\u8db3\u6210\u672c\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u5956\u52b1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "SafeMIL\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u79bb\u7ebf\u5b89\u5168\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u975e\u504f\u597d\u8f68\u8ff9\u5b66\u4e60\u5b89\u5168\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002"}}

Traditional peer-to-peer repositories and developer communities for shared technical knowledge and best practice have witnessed dramatic drops in participation in a short period of time. At the same time, agentic functional equivalents are yet to emerge leaving AI agents, which already generate a significant proportion of all new software code produced, without access to repositories of valuable shared learning.\n  In this paper, we introduce Spark, a novel shared agentic memory architecture which is designed to emulate the collective intelligence and know-how of human developer communities. Spark enables AI coding agents to both contribute to and draw from a persistent and continuously evolving experiential memory. Agents operating in the same general problem space use the Spark shared memory as a repository of new knowledge to achieve collective continual learning. We evaluate Spark as a coach for AI coding agents performing software development tasks. We demonstrate that recommendations made by Spark improve the quality of code generated by generic code generation models at varying sizes and capability tiers. Boosted by Spark, a small open-weights model with 30 billion parameters was able to match the code quality afforded by a much larger state-of-the-art model.

However, FL does not natively consider infrastructure efficiency, a critical concern for systems operating in resource-constrained environments. Several Reinforcement Learning (RL) based solutions offer improved client selection for FL; however, they do not consider infrastructure challenges, such as resource limitations and device churn. Furthermore, the training of RL methods is often not designed for practical application, as these approaches frequently do not consider generalizability and are not optimized for energy efficiency. To fill this gap, we propose BIPPO (Budget-aware Independent Proximal Policy Optimization), which is an energy-efficient multi-agent RL solution that improves performance. We evaluate BIPPO on two image classification tasks run in a highly budget-constrained setting, with FL clients training on non-IID data, a challenging context for vanilla FL. The improved sampler of BIPPO enables it to increase the mean accuracy compared to non-RL mechanisms, traditional PPO, and IPPO.

This paper introduces JobSphere, an AI-powered career assistant that is redefining the employment platform in Punjab called PGRKAM. JobSphere employs Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture, and it is multilingual, available in English, Hindi and Punjabi. JobSphere technique uses 4-bit quantization, allowing the platform to deploy on consumer-grade GPUs (i.e., NVIDIA RTX 3050 4GB), making the implementation 89% cheaper than that of cloud-based systems. Key innovations include voice-enabled interaction with the assistant, automated mock tests, resume parsing with skills recognition, and embed-based job recommendation that achieves a precision@10 score of 68%. An evaluation of JobSphere's implementation reveals 94% factual accuracy, a median response time of 1.8 seconds, and a System Usability Scale score of 78.5/100, a 50% improvement compared to the baseline PGRKAM platform context. In conclusion, JobSphere effectively fills significant accessibility gaps for Punjab/Hindi-speaking users in rural locations, while also affirming the users access to trusted job content provided by government agencies.", "AI": {"tldr": "JobSphere\u662f\u4e00\u4e2aAI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u804c\u4e1a\u52a9\u624b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7RAG\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u652f\u6301\u548c4\u4f4d\u91cf\u5316\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728PGRKAM\u5c31\u4e1a\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u63d0\u4f9b\u8bed\u97f3\u4ea4\u4e92\u3001\u6a21\u62df\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3001\u7b80\u5386\u89e3\u6790\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u804c\u4f4d\u63a8\u8350\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\u548c\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u653f\u5e9c\u5c31\u4e1a\u7f51\u7ad9\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u5bfc\u822a\u590d\u6742\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u9009\u9879\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u652f\u6301\u7b49\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u4e3a\u65c1\u906e\u666e/\u5370\u5730\u8bed\u519c\u6751\u7528\u6237\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5c31\u4e1a\u670d\u52a1\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210(RAG)\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u82f1\u8bed\u3001\u5370\u5730\u8bed\u548c\u65c1\u906e\u666e\u8bed\uff0c\u4f7f\u75284\u4f4d\u91cf\u5316\u6280\u672f\u5b9e\u73b0\u5728\u6d88\u8d39\u7ea7GPU\u4e0a\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u8bed\u97f3\u4ea4\u4e92\u3001\u81ea\u52a8\u6a21\u62df\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3001\u7b80\u5386\u89e3\u6790\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u804c\u4f4d\u63a8\u8350\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b094%\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4e2d\u4f4d\u54cd\u5e94\u65f6\u95f41.8\u79d2\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u8bc4\u520678.5/100\uff08\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u534750%\uff09\uff0c\u804c\u4f4d\u63a8\u8350\u7cbe\u5ea6@10\u8fbe\u523068%\uff0c\u90e8\u7f72\u6210\u672c\u6bd4\u4e91\u7cfb\u7edf\u964d\u4f4e89%\u3002", "conclusion": "JobSphere\u6709\u6548\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u65c1\u906e\u666e/\u5370\u5730\u8bed\u519c\u6751\u7528\u6237\u5728\u5c31\u4e1a\u670d\u52a1\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u6027\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u786e\u4fdd\u7528\u6237\u80fd\u591f\u8bbf\u95ee\u653f\u5e9c\u673a\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u804c\u4f4d\u5185\u5bb9\u3002"}}

To enhance CFR's applicability in large games, researchers use neural networks to approximate its behavior. However, existing methods are mainly based on vanilla CFR and struggle to effectively integrate more advanced CFR variants. In this work, we propose an efficient model-free neural CFR algorithm, overcoming the limitations of existing methods in approximating advanced CFR variants. At each iteration, it collects variance-reduced sampled advantages based on a value network, fits cumulative advantages by bootstrapping, and applies discounting and clipping operations to simulate the update mechanisms of advanced CFR variants. Experimental results show that, compared with model-free neural algorithms, it exhibits faster convergence in typical imperfect-information games and demonstrates stronger adversarial performance in a large poker game.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u795e\u7ecfCFR\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u8fd1\u4f3c\u9ad8\u7ea7CFR\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u5728\u975e\u5b8c\u5168\u4fe1\u606f\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u57fa\u4e8e\u57fa\u7840CFR\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u6574\u5408\u66f4\u5148\u8fdb\u7684CFR\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u6bcf\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u4e2d\uff1a\u6536\u96c6\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ef7\u503c\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\u7f29\u51cf\u91c7\u6837\u4f18\u52bf\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u4e3e\u6cd5\u62df\u5408\u7d2f\u79ef\u4f18\u52bf\uff1b\u5e94\u7528\u6298\u6263\u548c\u88c1\u526a\u64cd\u4f5c\u6765\u6a21\u62df\u9ad8\u7ea7CFR\u53d8\u4f53\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u5728\u5178\u578b\u975e\u5b8c\u5168\u4fe1\u606f\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u6536\u655b\u66f4\u5feb\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u578b\u6251\u514b\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u795e\u7ecfCFR\u7b97\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8fd1\u4f3c\u9ad8\u7ea7CFR\u53d8\u4f53\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u975e\u5b8c\u5168\u4fe1\u606f\u6e38\u620f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Recent Graph Neural Simulators (GNSs) accelerate simulations by learning dynamics on graph-structured data, yet often struggle to capture long-range interactions and suffer from error accumulation under autoregressive rollouts. To address these challenges, we propose Information-preserving Graph Neural Simulators (IGNS), a graph-based neural simulator built on the principles of Hamiltonian dynamics. This structure guarantees preservation of information across the graph, while extending to port-Hamiltonian systems allows the model to capture a broader class of dynamics, including non-conservative effects. IGNS further incorporates a warmup phase to initialize global context, geometric encoding to handle irregular meshes, and a multi-step training objective to reduce rollout error. To evaluate these properties systematically, we introduce new benchmarks that target long-range dependencies and challenging external forcing scenarios.

Following the growing scientific interest in mechanistic interpretability, recent work encoded refusal behavior as a single direction in the model's latent space; e.g., computed as the difference between the centroids of harmful and harmless prompt representations. However, emerging evidence suggests that concepts in LLMs often appear to be encoded as a low-dimensional manifold embedded in the high-dimensional latent space. Motivated by these findings, we propose a novel method leveraging Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) to extract multiple refusal directions. To this end, we first prove that SOMs generalize the prior work's difference-in-means technique. We then train SOMs on harmful prompt representations to identify multiple neurons. By subtracting the centroid of harmless representations from each neuron, we derive a set of multiple directions expressing the refusal concept. We validate our method on an extensive experimental setup, demonstrating that ablating multiple directions from models' internals outperforms not only the single-direction baseline but also specialized jailbreak algorithms, leading to an effective suppression of refusal.

We distinguish between behavioral faithfulness (alignment between reasoning and output) and perceptual faithfulness (alignment between reasoning and input), and introduce FaithEval for quantifying step-level and chain-level faithfulness by evaluating whether each claimed object is visually supported by the image. Building on these insights, we propose FaithAct, a faithfulness-first planning and acting framework that enforces evidential grounding at every reasoning step. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that FaithAct improves perceptual faithfulness by up to 26% without degrading task accuracy compared to prompt-based and tool-augmented baselines. Our analysis shows that treating faithfulness as a guiding principle not only mitigates hallucination but also leads to more stable reasoning trajectories. This work thereby establishes a unified framework for both evaluating and enforcing faithfulness in multimodal reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86FaithEval\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u548cFaithAct\u89c4\u5212\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5236\u6bcf\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u57fa\u7840\u6765\u6539\u5584\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u611f\u77e5\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe26%\u4e14\u4e0d\u964d\u4f4e\u4efb\u52a1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u770b\u4f3c\u5408\u7406\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4f9d\u636e\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u533a\u5206\u884c\u4e3a\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\uff08\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u8f93\u51fa\u5bf9\u9f50\uff09\u548c\u611f\u77e5\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\uff08\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u8f93\u5165\u5bf9\u9f50\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165FaithEval\u91cf\u5316\u6b65\u9aa4\u7ea7\u548c\u94fe\u7ea7\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6bcf\u4e2a\u58f0\u79f0\u5bf9\u8c61\u662f\u5426\u5f97\u5230\u89c6\u89c9\u652f\u6301\uff1b\u63d0\u51faFaithAct\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u6bcf\u4e00\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u5f3a\u5236\u8bc1\u636e\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cFaithAct\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u611f\u77e5\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe26%\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u964d\u4f4e\u4efb\u52a1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6307\u5bfc\u539f\u5219\u4e0d\u4ec5\u51cf\u8f7b\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd8\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u6267\u884c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

However, real-world time series often exhibit non-stationarity, including temporal distribution shifts and spectral variability, which pose significant challenges for long-term time series forecasting. In this paper, we propose DTAF, a dual-branch framework that addresses non-stationarity in both the temporal and frequency domains. For the temporal domain, the Temporal Stabilizing Fusion (TFS) module employs a non-stationary mix of experts (MOE) filter to disentangle and suppress temporal non-stationary patterns while preserving long-term dependencies. For the frequency domain, the Frequency Wave Modeling (FWM) module applies frequency differencing to dynamically highlight components with significant spectral shifts. By fusing the complementary outputs of TFS and FWM, DTAF generates robust forecasts that adapt to both temporal and frequency domain non-stationarity. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmarks demonstrate that DTAF outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, yielding significant improvements in forecasting accuracy under non-stationary conditions.

This \"patch\" introduces only 0.003% additional parameters, yet reliably steers model behavior toward that of a safer reference model.

From researchers choosing which problems to tackle next, to students deciding which ones to engage with, people's choices are often guided by judgments about how interesting or challenging problems are likely to be. As AI systems, such as LLMs, increasingly participate in mathematics with people -- whether for advanced research or education -- it becomes important to understand how well their judgments align with human ones. Our work examines this alignment through two empirical studies of human and LLM assessment of mathematical interestingness and difficulty, spanning a range of mathematical experience. We study two groups: participants from a crowdsourcing platform and International Math Olympiad competitors. We show that while many LLMs appear to broadly agree with human notions of interestingness, they mostly do not capture the distribution observed in human judgments. Moreover, most LLMs only somewhat align with why humans find certain math problems interesting, showing weak correlation with human-selected interestingness rationales. Together, our findings highlight both the promises and limitations of current LLMs in capturing human interestingness judgments for mathematical AI thought partnerships.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86LLMs\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u8da3\u5473\u6027\u548c\u96be\u5ea6\u5224\u65ad\u4e0a\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0LLMs\u867d\u7136\u5927\u81f4\u8ba4\u540c\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u8da3\u5473\u6027\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b8c\u5168\u6355\u6349\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u7684\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u9009\u62e9\u8da3\u5473\u6027\u7406\u7531\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u8f83\u5f31\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740AI\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u5982LLMs\uff09\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u53c2\u4e0e\u6570\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u6559\u80b2\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u5b83\u4eec\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u8da3\u5473\u6027\u548c\u96be\u5ea6\u5224\u65ad\u4e0a\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u53d8\u5f97\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9879\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5bf9\u4f17\u5305\u5e73\u53f0\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u548c\u56fd\u9645\u6570\u5b66\u5965\u6797\u5339\u514b\u7ade\u8d5b\u9009\u624b\u8fdb\u884c\u8c03\u67e5\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4eba\u7c7b\u548cLLMs\u5bf9\u6570\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u8da3\u5473\u6027\u548c\u96be\u5ea6\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "LLMs\u5728\u8da3\u5473\u6027\u5224\u65ad\u4e0a\u5927\u81f4\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b8c\u5168\u590d\u5236\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u9009\u62e9\u8da3\u5473\u6027\u7406\u7531\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u8f83\u5f31\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524dLLMs\u5728\u6355\u6349\u4eba\u7c7b\u6570\u5b66\u8da3\u5473\u6027\u5224\u65ad\u65b9\u9762\u65e2\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u4e5f\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6570\u5b66AI\u601d\u7ef4\u4f19\u4f34\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

The SNN-HDC achieved estimated energy consumption reductions ranging from 1.24x to 3.67x on the DvsGesture dataset and from 1.38x to 2.27x on the SL-Animals-DVS dataset.

To circumvent this, explanation-guided input manipulation has emerged as an indirect evaluation strategy, measuring explanation effectiveness through the impact of input modifications on model outcomes during inference. Despite the widespread use, a major concern with inference-based schemes is the distribution shift caused by such manipulations, which undermines the reliability of their assessments. The retraining-based scheme ROAR overcomes this issue by adapting the model to the altered data distribution. However, its evaluation results often contradict the theoretical foundations of widely accepted explainers. This work investigates this misalignment between empirical observations and theoretical expectations. In particular, we identify the sign issue as a key factor responsible for residual information that ultimately distorts retraining-based evaluation. Based on the analysis, we show that a straightforward reframing of the evaluation process can effectively resolve the identified issue. Building on the existing framework, we further propose novel variants that jointly structure a comprehensive perspective on explanation evaluation. These variants largely improve evaluation efficiency over the standard retraining protocol, thereby enhancing practical applicability for explainer selection and benchmarking. Following our proposed schemes, empirical results across various data scales provide deeper insights into the performance of carefully selected explainers, revealing open challenges and future directions in explainability research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6848ROAR\u5728\u89e3\u91ca\u5668\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7b26\u53f7\u95ee\u9898\u662f\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bc4\u4f30\u5931\u771f\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6848\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bc4\u4f30\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u771f\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u4f5c\u4e3a\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7279\u5f81\u5f52\u56e0\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e00\u76f4\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002\u867d\u7136ROAR\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u671f\u5b58\u5728\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u3002", "method": "\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u7b26\u53f7\u95ee\u9898\u662f\u5bfc\u81f4\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bc4\u4f30\u5931\u771f\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u91cd\u65b0\u6784\u5efa\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6846\u67b6\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u53d8\u4f53\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5171\u540c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6848\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u6807\u51c6\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u534f\u8bae\u3002\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u7cbe\u9009\u89e3\u91ca\u5668\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u6311\u6218\u548c\u672a\u6765\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6848\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u89e3\u91ca\u5668\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

These developments point toward the emergence of video foundation models that function not only as visual generators but also as implicit world models, models that simulate the physical dynamics, agent-environment interactions, and task planning that govern real or imagined worlds. This survey provides a systematic overview of this evolution, conceptualizing modern video foundation models as the combination of two core components: an implicit world model and a video renderer. The world model encodes structured knowledge about the world, including physical laws, interaction dynamics, and agent behavior. It serves as a latent simulation engine that enables coherent visual reasoning, long-term temporal consistency, and goal-driven planning. The video renderer transforms this latent simulation into realistic visual observations, effectively producing videos as a \"window\" into the simulated world. We trace the progression of video generation through four generations, in which the core capabilities advance step by step, ultimately culminating in a world model, built upon a video generation model, that embodies intrinsic physical plausibility, real-time multimodal interaction, and planning capabilities spanning multiple spatiotemporal scales.

Accepted for publication at AAAI 2026 (40th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence)", "summary": "Best-of-$N$ reasoning improves the accuracy of language models in solving complex tasks by sampling multiple candidate solutions and then selecting the best one based on some criteria. A critical bottleneck for this strategy is the output diversity limit, which occurs when the model generates similar outputs despite stochastic sampling, and hence recites the same error. To address this lack of variance in reasoning paths, we propose a novel unsupervised activation steering strategy that simultaneously optimizes the steering vectors for multiple reasoning trajectories at test time. At any synchronization anchor along the batch generation process, we find the steering vectors that maximize the total volume spanned by all possible intervened activation subsets. We demonstrate that these steering vectors can be determined by solving a Riemannian optimization problem over the product of spheres with a log-determinant objective function. We then use a Riemannian block-coordinate descent algorithm with a well-tuned learning rate to obtain a stationary point of the problem, and we apply these steering vectors until the generation process reaches the subsequent synchronization anchor. Empirical evaluations on popular mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that our test-time Riemannian activation steering strategy outperforms vanilla sampling techniques in terms of generative diversity and solution accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f15\u5bfc\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ece\u66fc\u4f18\u5316\u6700\u5927\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u6700\u4f73N\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u591a\u6837\u6027\u9650\u5236\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u6700\u4f73N\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u8f93\u51fa\u591a\u6837\u6027\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5373\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u968f\u673a\u91c7\u6837\u65f6\u4ecd\u751f\u6210\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u91cd\u590d\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u9ece\u66fc\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f15\u5bfc\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u6279\u91cf\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u627e\u5230\u6700\u5927\u5316\u6240\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u5e72\u9884\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5b50\u96c6\u603b\u4f53\u79ef\u7684\u5f15\u5bfc\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ece\u66fc\u5757\u5750\u6807\u4e0b\u964d\u7b97\u6cd5\u6c42\u89e3\u9ece\u66fc\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6d41\u884c\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u666e\u901a\u91c7\u6837\u6280\u672f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u9ece\u66fc\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f15\u5bfc\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

Here, we present MolRuleLoss, a substructure-substitution-rule-informed framework that improves the accuracy and generalizability of multiple molecular property regression models (MPRMs) such as GEM and UniMol for diverse molecular property prediction tasks. MolRuleLoss incorporates partial derivative constraints for substructure substitution rules (SSRs) into an MPRM's loss function. When using GEM models for predicting lipophilicity, water solubility, and solvation-free energy (using lipophilicity, ESOL, and freeSolv datasets from MoleculeNet), the root mean squared error (RMSE) values with and without MolRuleLoss were 0.587 vs. 0.660, 0.777 vs. 0.798, and 1.252 vs. 1.877, respectively, representing 2.6-33.3% performance improvements. We show that both the number and the quality of SSRs contribute to the magnitude of prediction accuracy gains obtained upon adding MolRuleLoss to an MPRM. MolRuleLoss improved the generalizability of MPRMs for \"activity cliff\" molecules in a lipophilicity prediction task and improved the generalizability of MPRMs for OOD molecules in a melting point prediction task. In a molecular weight prediction task for OOD molecules, MolRuleLoss reduced the RMSE value of a GEM model from 29.507 to 0.007. We also provide a formal demonstration that the upper bound of the variation for property change of SSRs is positively correlated with an MPRM's error.

The majority of the work in algorithmic fairness focus on assessing and improving the fairness of machine learning systems. There is relatively little research on fairness vulnerability, i.e., how an AI system's fairness can be intentionally compromised. In this work, we first provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that a simple adversarial poisoning strategy is sufficient to induce maximally unfair behavior in naive Bayes classifiers. Our key idea is to strategically inject a small fraction of carefully crafted adversarial data points into the training set, biasing the model's decision boundary to disproportionately affect a protected group while preserving generalizable performance. To illustrate the practical effectiveness of our method, we conduct experiments across several benchmark datasets and models. We find that our attack significantly outperforms existing methods in degrading fairness metrics across multiple models and datasets, often achieving substantially higher levels of unfairness with a comparable or only slightly worse impact on accuracy. Notably, our method proves effective on a wide range of models, in contrast to prior work, demonstrating a robust and potent approach to compromising the fairness of machine learning systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u6734\u7d20\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5411\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u6ce8\u5165\u5c11\u91cf\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6570\u636e\u70b9\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8f83\u597d\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u91c7\u7528\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5176\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u53d8\u5f97\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u5173\u4e8e\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff08\u5373AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5982\u4f55\u88ab\u6545\u610f\u7834\u574f\uff09\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u76f8\u5bf9\u8f83\u5c11\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6295\u6bd2\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6218\u7565\u6027\u5730\u5411\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u6ce8\u5165\u5c11\u91cf\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6570\u636e\u70b9\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\u504f\u5411\u4e8e\u4e0d\u6210\u6bd4\u4f8b\u5730\u5f71\u54cd\u53d7\u4fdd\u62a4\u7fa4\u4f53\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u964d\u4f4e\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6307\u6807\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u4ee5\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u4ec5\u7a0d\u5dee\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5f71\u54cd\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6c34\u5e73\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u90fd\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7834\u574f\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5f3a\u5927\u800c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7834\u574f\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7a81\u663e\u4e86\u5f53\u524dAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5728\u90e8\u7f72\u524d\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u9632\u8303\u6b64\u7c7b\u653b\u51fb\u3002"}}

We propose a unifying theoretical framework that characterizes when different bias mechanisms produce quantitatively equivalent effects on model performance. By formalizing biases as violations of conditional independence through information-theoretic measures, we prove formal equivalence conditions relating spurious correlations, subpopulation shift, class imbalance, and fairness violations. Our theory predicts that a spurious correlation of strength $\u03b1$ produces equivalent worst-group accuracy degradation as a sub-population imbalance ratio $r \\approx (1+\u03b1)/(1-\u03b1)$ under feature overlap assumptions. Empirical validation in six datasets and three architectures confirms that predicted equivalences hold within the accuracy of the worst group 3\\%, enabling the principled transfer of debiasing methods across problem domains.

Despite the advantages of Reinforcement Learning (RL) in single tasks, extending conventional RL methods to prioritized multiple objectives remains challenging. In particular, traditional Safe RL and Multi-Objective RL (MORL) methods have difficulty enforcing priority orderings efficiently. Therefore, Lexicographic Multi-Objective RL (LMORL) methods have been developed to address these challenges. However, existing LMORL methods either rely on heuristic threshold tuning with prior knowledge or are restricted to discrete domains. To overcome these limitations, we propose Lexicographically Projected Policy Gradient RL (LPPG-RL), a novel LMORL framework which leverages sequential gradient projections to identify feasible policy update directions, thereby enabling LPPG-RL broadly compatible with all policy gradient algorithms in continuous spaces. LPPG-RL reformulates the projection step as an optimization problem, and utilizes Dykstra's projection rather than generic solvers to deliver great speedups, especially for small- to medium-scale instances.

While neural network-based models have achieved notable success in this domain, complex channel-dependent models often suffer from performance degradation compared to channel-independent models that do not consider the relationship between components but provide high robustness due to small capacity. In this work, we propose HN-MVTS, a novel architecture that integrates a hypernetwork-based generative prior with an arbitrary neural network forecasting model. The input of this hypernetwork is a learnable embedding matrix of time series components. To restrict the number of new parameters, the hypernetwork learns to generate the weights of the last layer of the target forecasting networks, serving as a data-adaptive regularizer that improves generalization and long-range predictive accuracy. The hypernetwork is used only during the training, so it does not increase the inference time compared to the base forecasting model. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that application of HN-MVTS to the state-of-the-art models (DLinear, PatchTST, TSMixer, etc.) typically improves their performance.

To address these issues, the field of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has developed various methods aimed at clarifying AI decision-making, thereby facilitating appropriate trust and validating the fairness of outcomes. Among these methods, prototype-based explanations offer a promising approach that uses representative examples to elucidate model behavior. However, a critical gap exists regarding standardized benchmarks to objectively compare prototype-based XAI methods, especially in the context of time series data. This lack of reliable benchmarks results in subjective evaluations, hindering progress in the field. We aim to establish a robust framework, ProtoScore, for assessing prototype-based XAI methods across different data types with a focus on time series data, facilitating fair and comprehensive evaluations. By integrating the Co-12 properties of Nauta et al., this framework allows for effectively comparing prototype methods against each other and against other XAI methods, ultimately assisting practitioners in selecting appropriate explanation methods while minimizing the costs associated with user studies.

While presenting notable progress for the Transformer architecture, iTransformer still lags behind the latest MLP-based models.

By introducing three key inductive biases, i.e., \\textit{global stability}, \\textit{phase sensitivity}, and \\textit{cross-axis specificity}, EMAformer unlocks the further potential of the Transformer architecture, achieving state-of-the-art performance on 12 real-world benchmarks and reducing forecasting errors by an average of 2.73\\% in MSE and 5.15\\% in MAE.

When this corpus contains sensitive information, however, unprotected RAG systems are at risk of leaking private information. Prior work has introduced differential privacy (DP) guarantees for RAG, but only in single-query settings, which fall short of realistic usage. In this paper, we study the more practical multi-query setting and propose two DP-RAG algorithms. The first, MURAG, leverages an individual privacy filter so that the accumulated privacy loss only depends on how frequently each document is retrieved rather than the total number of queries. The second, MURAG-ADA, further improves utility by privately releasing query-specific thresholds, enabling more precise selection of relevant documents.

We propose Adaptive Regularized Multi-Agent Soft Actor-Critic (ARAC), which integrates an attention-based graph neural network (GNN) for modeling agent dependencies with an adaptive divergence regularization mechanism. The GNN enables expressive representation of spatial relations and state features in graph environments. Divergence regularization can serve as policy guidance to alleviate the sparse reward problem, but it may lead to suboptimal convergence when the reference policy itself is imperfect. The adaptive divergence regularization mechanism enables the framework to exploit reference policies for efficient exploration in the early stages, while gradually reducing reliance on them as training progresses to avoid inheriting their limitations. Experiments in pursuit and confrontation scenarios demonstrate that ARAC achieves faster convergence, higher final success rates, and stronger scalability across varying numbers of agents compared with MARL baselines, highlighting its effectiveness in complex graph-structured environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86ARAC\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u53d1\u6563\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u8ffd\u6355\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u534f\u8c03\u9ad8\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5efa\u6a21\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u53d1\u6563\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u65e9\u671f\u5229\u7528\u53c2\u8003\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u6548\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u540e\u671f\u51cf\u5c11\u4f9d\u8d56\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u7ee7\u627f\u5176\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8ffd\u6355\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0cARAC\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u3001\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6700\u7ec8\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6570\u91cf\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ARAC\u5728\u590d\u6742\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u673a\u5236\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u63a2\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u3002"}}

Conventional methods rely on large batches for approximation, demanding substantial computational resources. To mitigate this issue, prior works introduced per-sample normalizer estimators, which are updated at each epoch in a blockwise coordinate manner to keep track of updated encoders. However, this scheme incurs optimization error that scales with the ratio of dataset size to batch size, limiting effectiveness for large datasets or small batches. To overcome this limitation, we propose NeuCLIP, a novel and elegant optimization framework based on two key ideas: (i) $\\textbf{reformulating}$ the contrastive loss for each sample $\\textbf{via convex analysis}$ into a minimization problem with an auxiliary variable representing its log-normalizer; and (ii) $\\textbf{transforming}$ the resulting minimization over $n$ auxiliary variables (where $n$ is the dataset size) via $\\textbf{variational analysis}$ into the minimization over a compact neural network that predicts the log-normalizers. We design an alternating optimization algorithm that jointly trains the CLIP model and the auxiliary network. By employing a tailored architecture and acceleration techniques for the auxiliary network, NeuCLIP achieves more accurate normalizer estimation, leading to improved performance compared with previous methods.

Traditional numerical solvers are computationally expensive and sensitive to discretisation, while canonical deep learning methods are data-hungry and struggle with chaotic dynamics and long-term predictions. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) mitigate some of these issues by incorporating physical constraints in the learning process, yet they remain limited by mesh resolution and long-term predictive stability. In this work, we propose a Physics-Informed Neural Operator (PINO) approach to solve PDE problems in cardiac EP. Unlike PINNs, PINO models learn mappings between function spaces, allowing them to generalise to multiple mesh resolutions and initial conditions. Our results show that PINO models can accurately reproduce cardiac EP dynamics over extended time horizons and across multiple propagation scenarios, including zero-shot evaluations on scenarios unseen during training. Additionally, our PINO models maintain high predictive quality in long roll-outs (where predictions are recursively fed back as inputs), and can scale their predictive resolution by up to 10x the training resolution.

Many downstream applications, however, demand enforcing hard constraints on generated samples (for example, robot trajectories must avoid obstacles), a requirement that goes beyond simple guidance. Prevailing projection-based approaches constrain the entire sampling path to the constraint manifold, which is overly restrictive and degrades sample quality. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework that reformulates hard-constrained sampling as a trajectory optimization problem. Our key insight is to leverage numerical optimal control to steer the sampling trajectory so that constraints are satisfied precisely at the terminal time. By exploiting the underlying structure of flow-matching models and adopting techniques from model predictive control, we transform this otherwise complex constrained optimization problem into a tractable surrogate that can be solved efficiently and effectively. Furthermore, this trajectory optimization perspective offers significant flexibility beyond mere constraint satisfaction, allowing for the inclusion of integral costs to minimize distribution shift and terminal objectives to further enhance sample quality, all within a unified framework. We provide a control-theoretic analysis of our method, establishing bounds on the approximation error between our tractable surrogate and the ideal formulation.

Experiments show universal pre-training is an essential stabilizer, preventing collapse on SEED (vs. scratch) and yielding substantial gains on DEAP (+7.65%) and DREAMER (+3.55%). Our framework achieves new SOTA performance on all within-subject benchmarks: SEED (99.27%), DEAP (93.69%), and DREAMER (93.93%). We also show SOTA cross-dataset transfer, achieving 94.08% (intersection) and 93.05% (UCS) on the unseen DREAMER dataset, with the former surpassing the within-domain pre-training benchmark. Ablation studies validate our architecture: the GAT module is critical, yielding a +22.19% gain over GCN on the high-noise DEAP dataset, and its removal causes a catastrophic -16.44% performance drop.

We present a comprehensive theory of JEPAs and instantiate it in {\\bf LeJEPA}, a lean, scalable, and theoretically grounded training objective. First, we identify the isotropic Gaussian as the optimal distribution that JEPAs' embeddings should follow to minimize downstream prediction risk. Second, we introduce a novel objective--{\\bf Sketched Isotropic Gaussian Regularization} (SIGReg)--to constrain embeddings to reach that ideal distribution. Combining the JEPA predictive loss with SIGReg yields LeJEPA with numerous theoretical and practical benefits: (i) single trade-off hyperparameter, (ii) linear time and memory complexity, (iii) stability across hyper-parameters, architectures (ResNets, ViTs, ConvNets) and domains, (iv) heuristics-free, e.g., no stop-gradient, no teacher-student, no hyper-parameter schedulers, and (v) distributed training-friendly implementation requiring only $\\approx$50 lines of code. Our empirical validation covers 10+ datasets, 60+ architectures, all with varying scales and domains. As an example, using imagenet-1k for pretraining and linear evaluation with frozen backbone, LeJEPA reaches 79\\% with a ViT-H/14.

We revisit this paradox and show that sparsity is a surface artifact of a model-conditioned optimization bias: for a fixed pretrained model, updates consistently localize to preferred parameter regions, highly consistent across runs and largely invariant to datasets and RL recipes. We mechanistically explain these dynamics with a Three-Gate Theory: Gate I (KL Anchor) imposes a KL-constrained update; Gate II (Model Geometry) steers the step off principal directions into low-curvature, spectrum-preserving subspaces; and Gate III (Precision) hides micro-updates in non-preferred regions, making the off-principal bias appear as sparsity. We then validate this theory and, for the first time, provide a parameter-level characterization of RLVR's learning dynamics: RLVR learns off principal directions in weight space, achieving gains via minimal spectral drift, reduced principal-subspace rotation, and off-principal update alignment. In contrast, SFT targets principal weights, distorts the spectrum, and even lags RLVR.\n  Together, these results provide the first parameter-space account of RLVR's training dynamics, revealing clear regularities in how parameters evolve. Crucially, we show that RL operates in a distinct optimization regime from SFT, so directly adapting SFT-era parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods can be flawed, as evidenced by our case studies on advanced sparse fine-tuning and LoRA variants. We hope this work charts a path toward a white-box understanding of RLVR and the design of geometry-aware, RLVR-native learning algorithms, rather than repurposed SFT-era heuristics.", "AI": {"tldr": "RLVR\uff08\u5e26\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u975e\u4e3b\u65b9\u5411\u6743\u91cd\u66f4\u65b0\u5b9e\u73b0\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5176\u53c2\u6570\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u662f\u6a21\u578b\u6761\u4ef6\u4f18\u5316\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u8868\u9762\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u771f\u5b9e\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u91caRLVR\u4e2d\u770b\u4f3c\u53c2\u6570\u7a00\u758f\u7684\u6096\u8bba\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u52a8\u6001\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7406\u89e3RL\u4e0eSFT\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u672c\u8d28\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u95e8\u7406\u8bba\uff1aKL\u951a\u5b9a\u95e8\u7ea6\u675fKL\u6563\u5ea6\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u51e0\u4f55\u95e8\u5f15\u5bfc\u66f4\u65b0\u5230\u4f4e\u66f2\u7387\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u95e8\u9690\u85cf\u975e\u504f\u597d\u533a\u57df\u7684\u5fae\u66f4\u65b0\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u7ea7\u5206\u6790\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "result": "RLVR\u5728\u6743\u91cd\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u975e\u4e3b\u65b9\u5411\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u8c31\u6f02\u79fb\u3001\u51cf\u5c11\u4e3b\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u65cb\u8f6c\u548c\u975e\u4e3b\u65b9\u5411\u66f4\u65b0\u5bf9\u9f50\u5b9e\u73b0\u6027\u80fd\u589e\u76ca\uff0c\u4e0eSFT\u7684\u4e3b\u6743\u91cd\u76ee\u6807\u5f62\u6210\u9c9c\u660e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "conclusion": "RL\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u673a\u5236\u4e0a\u4e0eSFT\u5b58\u5728\u672c\u8d28\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5957\u7528SFT\u65f6\u4ee3\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8bbe\u8ba1\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u7684RLVR\u539f\u751f\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002"}}

In contrast to MLPs, KANs leverage parameterized, trainable activation functions and offer several benefits including improved interpretability and higher accuracy on learning symbolic equations. However, the original KAN architecture requires adjustments to the domain discretization of the network (called the \"domain grid\") during training, creating extra overhead for the user in the training process. Typical KAN layers are not designed with the ability to autonomously update their domains in a data-driven manner informed by the changing output ranges of previous layers. As an added benefit, this histogram algorithm may also be applied towards detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs in a variety of settings. We demonstrate that AdaptKAN exceeds or matches the performance of prior KAN architectures and MLPs on four different tasks: learning scientific equations from the Feynman dataset, image classification from frozen features, learning a control Lyapunov function, and detecting OOD inputs on the OpenOOD v1.5 benchmark.", "AI": {"tldr": "AdaptKAN\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7684Kolmogorov-Arnold\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u81ea\u52a8\u8c03\u6574\u57df\u7f51\u683c\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u539fKAN\u9700\u8981\u624b\u52a8\u8c03\u6574\u57df\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u539fKAN\u67b6\u6784\u9700\u8981\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u624b\u52a8\u8c03\u6574\u57df\u7f51\u683c\uff0c\u7ed9\u7528\u6237\u5e26\u6765\u989d\u5916\u8d1f\u62c5\uff0c\u4e14\u6807\u51c6KAN\u5c42\u65e0\u6cd5\u6839\u636e\u524d\u5c42\u8f93\u51fa\u8303\u56f4\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u81ea\u4e3b\u66f4\u65b0\u5176\u57df\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAdaptKAN\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u81ea\u52a8\u8c03\u6574\u57df\u7f51\u683c\uff0c\u8be5\u76f4\u65b9\u56fe\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fd8\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u5404\u79cd\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u8f93\u5165\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff1a\u5b66\u4e60Feynman\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u65b9\u7a0b\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u51bb\u7ed3\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u5b66\u4e60\u63a7\u5236Lyapunov\u51fd\u6570\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728OpenOOD v1.5\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u68c0\u6d4bOOD\u8f93\u5165\u3002", "conclusion": "AdaptKAN\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u5148\u524dKAN\u67b6\u6784\u548cMLPs\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u57df\u7f51\u683c\u8c03\u6574\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

It requires the integration of several capabilities, including multi-step reasoning, cross-document synthesis, and the generation of evidence-backed, long-form answers. Evaluating DR remains challenging because responses are lengthy and diverse, admit many valid solutions, and often depend on dynamic information sources. We introduce ResearchRubrics, a standardized benchmark for DR built with over 2,800+ hours of human labor that pairs realistic, domain-diverse prompts with 2,500+ expert-written, fine-grained rubrics to assess factual grounding, reasoning soundness, and clarity. We also propose a new complexity framework for categorizing DR tasks along three axes: conceptual breadth, logical nesting, and exploration. In addition, we develop human and model-based evaluation protocols that measure rubric adherence for DR agents. We evaluate several state-of-the-art DR systems and find that even leading agents like Gemini's DR and OpenAI's DR achieve under 68% average compliance with our rubrics, primarily due to missed implicit context and inadequate reasoning about retrieved information.
