Abstract: Reservoir computing is a type of a recurrent neural network, mapping the inputs into higher dimensional space using fixed and nonlinear dynamical systems, called reservoirs. In the literature, there are various types of reservoirs ranging from in-silico to in-vitro. In cheminformatics, previous studies contributed to the field by developing simulation-based chemically inspired in-silico reservoir models. Yahiro used a DNA-based chemical reaction network as its reservoir and Nguyen developed a DNA chemistry-inspired tool based on Gillespie algorithm. However, these software tools were designed mainly with the focus on DNA chemistry and their maintenance status has limited their current usability. Due to these limitations, there was a need for a proper open-source tool. This study introduces ChemReservoir, an open-source framework for chemically-inspired reservoir computing. In contrast to the former studies focused on DNA-chemistry, ChemReservoir is a general framework for the construction and analysis of chemically-inspired reservoirs, which also addresses the limitations in these previous studies by ensuring enhanced testing, evaluation, and reproducibility. The tool was evaluated using various cycle-based reservoir topologies and demonstrated stable performance across a range of configurations in memory capacity tasks.

Conclusion: Not mentioned in abstract

Abstract: Twin transition is the method of parallel digital and sustainability transitions in a mutually supporting way or, in common terms, "greening of and by IT and data." Twin transition reacts to the growing problem of unsustainable digitalization, particularly in the ecological sense. Ignoring this problem will eventually limit the digital adeptness of society and the problem-solving capacity of humankind. Information systems engineering must find ways to support twin transition journeys through its substantial body of knowledge, methods, and techniques. To this end, we systematically survey the academic and gray literature on twin transition, clarify key concepts, and derive leads for researchers and practitioners to steer their innovation efforts.

Abstract: WiFi-based home monitoring has emerged as a compelling alternative to traditional camera- and sensor-based solutions, offering wide coverage with minimal intrusion by leveraging existing wireless infrastructure. This paper presents key insights and lessons learned from developing and deploying a large-scale WiFi sensing solution, currently operational across over 10 million commodity off-the-shelf routers and 100 million smart bulbs worldwide. Through this extensive deployment, we identify four real-world challenges that hinder the practical adoption of prior research: 1) Non-human movements (e.g., pets) frequently trigger false positives; 2) Low-cost WiFi chipsets and heterogeneous hardware introduce inconsistencies in channel state information (CSI) measurements; 3) Motion interference in multi-user environments complicates occupant differentiation; 4) Computational constraints on edge devices and limited cloud transmission impede real-time processing. To address these challenges, we present a practical and scalable system, validated through comprehensive two-year evaluations involving 280 edge devices, across 16 scenarios, and over 4 million motion samples. Our solutions achieve an accuracy of 92.61% in diverse real-world homes while reducing false alarms due to non-human movements from 63.1% to 8.4% and lowering CSI transmission overhead by 99.72%. Notably, our system integrates sensing and communication, supporting simultaneous WiFi sensing and data transmission over home WiFi networks. While focused on home monitoring, our findings and strategies generalize to various WiFi sensing applications. By bridging the gaps between theoretical research and commercial deployment, this work offers practical insights for scaling WiFi sensing in real-world environments.

### [5] [Perturbative Gradient Training: A novel training paradigm for bridging the gap between deep neural networks and physical reservoir computing](2506.04523)

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 该论文旨在解决物理储层计算中由于黑盒性质而无法进行反向传播的问题。

Method: PGT 使用网络参数空间中的随机扰动来近似梯度更新，仅使用前向传递。

Result: 我们的结果表明，PGT 可以实现与标准反向传播方法相当的性能，尤其是在反向传播不切实际或不可能的情况下。

Conclusion: PGT 代表了将物理储层集成到更深层神经网络架构中并在人工智能训练中实现显着的能源效率提升方面迈出的有希望的一步。

Abstract: We introduce Perturbative Gradient Training (PGT), a novel training paradigm that overcomes a critical limitation of physical reservoir computing: the inability to perform backpropagation due to the black-box nature of physical reservoirs. Drawing inspiration from perturbation theory in physics, PGT uses random perturbations in the network's parameter space to approximate gradient updates using only forward passes. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach on both simulated neural network architectures, including a dense network and a transformer model with a reservoir layer, and on experimental hardware using a magnonic auto-oscillation ring as the physical reservoir. Our results show that PGT can achieve performance comparable to that of standard backpropagation methods in cases where backpropagation is impractical or impossible. PGT represents a promising step toward integrating physical reservoirs into deeper neural network architectures and achieving significant energy efficiency gains in AI training.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种校准OIO的方法，该方法提高了在机器人手术和非接触式安全筛查等应用中的定位精度。

Abstract: Visual inertial odometry (VIO) is a process for fusing visual and kinematic data to understand a machine's state in a navigation task. Olfactory inertial odometry (OIO) is an analog to VIO that fuses signals from gas sensors with inertial data to help a robot navigate by scent. Gas dynamics and environmental factors introduce disturbances into olfactory navigation tasks that can make OIO difficult to facilitate. With our work here, we define a process for calibrating a robot for OIO that generalizes to several olfaction sensor types. Our focus is specifically on calibrating OIO for centimeter-level accuracy in localizing an odor source on a slow-moving robot platform to demonstrate use cases in robotic surgery and touchless security screening. We demonstrate our process for OIO calibration on a real robotic arm and show how this calibration improves performance over a cold-start olfactory navigation task.

Conclusion: 该研究表明，针对不同电路层采用最有效的模拟方法可以显著提高量子机器学习电路模拟的性能。

Abstract: Hardware-efficient circuits employed in Quantum Machine Learning are typically composed of alternating layers of uniformly applied gates. High-speed numerical simulators for such circuits are crucial for advancing research in this field. In this work, we numerically benchmark universal and gate-specific techniques for simulating the action of layers of gates on quantum state vectors, aiming to accelerate the overall simulation of Quantum Machine Learning algorithms. Our analysis shows that the optimal simulation method for a given layer of gates depends on the number of qubits involved, and that a tailored combination of techniques can yield substantial performance gains in the forward and backward passes for a given circuit. Building on these insights, we developed a numerical simulator, named TQml Simulator, that employs the most efficient simulation method for each layer in a given circuit. We evaluated TQml Simulator on circuits constructed from standard gate sets, such as rotations and CNOTs, as well as on native gates from IonQ and IBM quantum processing units. In most cases, our simulator outperforms equivalent Pennylane's default.qubit simulator by approximately 2- to 100-fold, depending on the circuit, the number of qubits, the batch size of the input data, and the hardware used.
