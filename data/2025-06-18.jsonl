Using the Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo\n(DQMC) method, we explore the finite-temperature phase diagram and provide\nevidence for three distinct regions -- a three-component Fermi liquid (FL)\nregion, a \"trion\" liquid (TL) region, and an ordered Charge Density Wave (CDW)\nphase. The CDW phase is stable at finite temperature (in contrast to the SU(2)\nCDW), while the FL to TL crossover appears to point to a quantum phase\ntransition at zero temperature.

For the trapped-ion system, a number of methods of\nreconstructing the quantum states have been developed, including the\nmeasurement of the Q quasi-probability function and the density matrix elements\nin the Fock basis, but these approaches are often slow and difficult to scale\nto multi-mode states. Here, we demonstrate a novel and powerful scheme for\nreconstructing a continuous-variable quantum state that uses the direct\nsingle-shot measurement of the joint parity of the phonon states of a trapped\nion. We drive a spin-dependent bichromatic beam-splitter interaction that\ncoherently exchanges phonons between different harmonic oscillator modes of the\nion. This interaction encodes the joint parity information into the relative\nphase between the two spin states, enabling measurement of the combined\nphonon-number parity across multiple modes in a single shot. Leveraging this\ncapability, we directly measure multi-mode Wigner quasi-probability\ndistributions to perform quantum state tomography of an entangled coherent\nstate, and show that the generated state is non-positive under partial\ntranspose, confirming its entanglement. We further show that the single-shot\njoint parity measurement can be used to detect parity-flip errors in real time.\nBy post-selecting the parity measurement outcomes, we experimentally\ndemonstrate the extension of the bosonic state lifetime, effectively\nimplementing an error mitigation technique. Lastly, we identify the various\nsources of error affecting the fidelity of the spin-dependent beam-splitter\noperation and study the feasibility of high fidelity operations. The\ninteraction studied in this work can be easily extended to more than two modes,\nand is highly relevant to continuous-variable quantum computing and quantum\nmetrology."}

In situations where\nthe oscillator is close to the parametric resonance, and the coupling to the\ndriving field is strong enough for a complex eigenfrequency to lie in the upper\nhalf of the first Riemann sheet, the number of photons of the parametric\noscillator and the continuous field increases exponentially.

Furthermore, we address the Maximum\nIndependent Set (MIS) problem on embedded disk graphs and demonstrate that a\nlocal drive, informed by local blockade radii, outperforms the globally applied\ndrive commonly used for solving the MIS problem in unit disk graphs."}

The overhead can be reduced by\nengineering physical qubits with fewer errors, and by shaping the residual\nerrors to be more easily correctable. In this work, we demonstrate quantum\nerror correcting codes and logical qubit circuits in a metastable ${}^{171}$Yb\nqubit with a noise bias towards erasure errors, that is, errors whose location\ncan be detected separate from any syndrome information. We show that dephasing\nerrors on the nuclear spin qubit during coherent transport can be strongly\nsuppressed, and implement robust entangling gates that maintain a high fidelity\nin the presence of gate beam inhomogeneity or pointing error. We demonstrate\nlogical qubit encoding in the $[[4,2,2]]$ code, with error correction during\ndecoding based on mid-circuit erasure measurements despite the fact that the\ncode is too small to correct any Pauli errors. Finally, we demonstrate logical\nqubit teleportation between multiple code blocks with conditionally selected\nancillas based on mid-circuit erasure checks, which is a key ingredient for\nleakage-robust error correction with neutral atoms."}

We find that entanglement\nstrongly suppresses the delay between the transmission and absorption events,\nwhich become synchronous in the limit of strongly entangled wave packets. By\ncomparing numerical simulations with analytic modeling, we trace back this\nbehavior to the representation of entangled wave packets in terms of a\nsuperposition of multiple train pulses containing an increasing number of\nultrashort non-entangled packets. As a result, we show that the entangled\ndriving allows the creation of a matter excitation on a time scale shorter than\nthe temporal width of the pulse.

In this approach, the two-dimensional\nquantum state of a massive quantum clock becomes, after propagating at low\nspeed and in a weak gravitational field, a function of the post-Newtonian\nparameters and thus a signature of a metric theory. To discriminate among\nmetric theories, we resort to quantum-state discrimination strategies such as\nminimum error and unambiguous state discrimination. In particular, we show that\nit is possible to refute the hypothesis that a particular metric theory\ndescribes spacetime with a single detection event and that it is possible to\ndiscriminate with certainty between two different metrics, also with a single\ndetection event. In general, the success probability of the discrimination\nstrategy is a harmonic function of the product of the difference of the proper\ntime corresponding to each quantum clock state, the energy difference between\nthe energy eigenstates of the quantum clock, the propagation length, and speed.\nIt is thus possible to find suitable length and speed scales such that the\nsuccess probability is close to one by selecting a quantum system with the\nhighest energy difference and the largest natural lifetime. According to this,\natomic nuclei such as thorium are considered the most suitable quantum clocks."}

To this end,\nwe simulate the time evolution of two interacting electrons on a finite-size\nchain governed by an extended Hubbard Hamiltonian including on-site Coulomb\nrepulsion $ U $ and nearest-neighbor interaction $V$, along with\nsingle-electron hopping $J$. By introducing a local site energy defect with\namplitude $ \\Delta $, we show that a transition between spatially\npaired/dissociated electrons can occur in the vicinity of this site. Such\nmechanisms arise in a strongly correlated regime with non-zero nearest neighbor\nCoulomb interactions and under the conditions $ (U \\sim V \\sim \\Delta) \\gg J$.\nTo rationalize these phenomena, we reformulate the two-electron dynamics of the\noriginal Hubbard chain as an effective single-particle problem on a\ntwo-dimensional network. Within this framework, we show that the\npairing/dissociation dynamics are driven by resonances between two distinct\nfamilies of two-electron eigenstates: $(i)$ states with two spatially\nwell-separated electrons with one located at the site defect, and $(ii)$ states\nwith locally bound electron located away from the defect. At resonance, these\nstates hybridize, allowing transitions from locally paired to dissociated\nelectrons (and vice versa) in the vicinity of the defect.
