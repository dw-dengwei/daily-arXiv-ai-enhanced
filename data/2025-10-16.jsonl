Code and data are available at\n  https://github.com/strongSoda/LITERAL-TO-LIBERAL", "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed as the reasoning\nengines for agentic AI systems, yet they exhibit a critical flaw: a rigid\nadherence to explicit rules that leads to decisions misaligned with human\ncommon sense and intent. This \"rule-rigidity\" is a significant barrier to\nbuilding trustworthy autonomous agents. While prior work has shown that\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) with human explanations can mitigate this issue,\nSFT is computationally expensive and inaccessible to many practitioners. To\naddress this gap, we introduce the Rule-Intent Distinction (RID) Framework, a\nnovel, low-compute meta-prompting technique designed to elicit human-aligned\nexception handling in LLMs in a zero-shot manner. The RID framework provides\nthe model with a structured cognitive schema for deconstructing tasks,\nclassifying rules, weighing conflicting outcomes, and justifying its final\ndecision. We evaluated the RID framework against baseline and Chain-of-Thought\n(CoT) prompting on a custom benchmark of 20 scenarios requiring nuanced\njudgment across diverse domains. Our human-verified results demonstrate that\nthe RID framework significantly improves performance, achieving a 95% Human\nAlignment Score (HAS), compared to 80% for the baseline and 75% for CoT.\nFurthermore, it consistently produces higher-quality, intent-driven reasoning.\nThis work presents a practical, accessible, and effective method for steering\nLLMs from literal instruction-following to liberal, goal-oriented reasoning,\npaving the way for more reliable and pragmatic AI agents."}

In\nthis work, we conduct a thorough investigation into the root causes of\npseudo-alignment in LLM4TS and build a connection of pseudo-alignment to the\ncone effect in LLM.

An alternative is to perform RL from human feedback, which involves\nlearning a reward function from scratch by collecting human preferences over\npairs of trajectories. However, building such datasets is costly. To address\nthe limitations of both approaches, we propose Preference-Based Reward Repair\n(PBRR): an automated iterative framework that repairs a human-specified proxy\nreward function by learning an additive, transition-dependent correction term\nfrom preferences. A manually specified reward function can yield policies that\nare highly suboptimal under the ground-truth objective, yet corrections on only\na few transitions may suffice to recover optimal performance. To identify and\ncorrect for those transitions, PBRR uses a targeted exploration strategy and a\nnew preference-learning objective. We prove in tabular domains PBRR has a\ncumulative regret that matches, up to constants, that of prior preference-based\nRL methods.

Recent works have also indicated that\nmodel confidence can serve effectively as a reward metric, distinguishing\nbetween chain-of-thought (CoT) and non-CoT paths. However, the concept of using\nconfidence as a reward has not been comprehensively studied. In this work, we\nsystematically investigate Confidence-as-a-Reward (CRew), a simple yet powerful\ntraining-free method that utilizes token-level confidence in the model's final\nanswers as a proxy for reward, especially suitable for close-ended tasks.\nThrough extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks, we demonstrate\nthat CRew outperforms existing training-free reward approaches on the MATH500\nand RewardMATH benchmarks, and even surpasses most trained reward models. We\nfurther identify a strong correlation between CRew scores and the actual\nreasoning performance of the model. Additionally, we find that CRew can\neffectively filter high-quality training data.

In this work, we\npresent a theoretically grounded framework for constructing complete\nequivariant GNNs that is both efficient and practical.

Evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate\nstate-of-the-art performance in several cases, with rules maintaining a\ncomponent similar to traditional Mamdani systems while improving precision\nthrough improved rule outputs. This hybrid methodology offers a balanced and\nversatile tool for predictive modelling, addressing the trade-off between\ninterpretability and accuracy inherent in fuzzy systems. In the 6 datasets\ntested, the proposed approach gave the best fuzzy methodology score in 4\ndatasets, out-performed the opaque models in 2 datasets and produced the best\noverall score in 1 dataset with the improvements in RMSE ranging from 0.4% to\n19%."}

Accurate Global Positioning System (GPS) points of parking\nspots are the core data for subsequent applications,e.g., parking management,\nparking policy, and urban development. However, high-rise buildings tend to\ncause GPS points to drift from the actual locations of parking spots; besides,\nthe standard lower-cost GPS equipment itself has a certain location error.\nTherefore, it is a non-trivial task to correct a few wrong GPS points from a\nlarge number of parking spots in an unsupervised approach. In this paper,\nmotivated by the physical constraints of parking spots (i.e., parking spots are\nparallel to the sides of roads), we propose an unsupervised low-rank method to\neffectively rectify errors in GPS points and further align them to the parking\nspots in a unified framework.

A sufficient condition for nonnegativity is the Sum of Squares (SOS)\nproperty, i.e., it can be written as a sum of squares of other polynomials. In\npractice, however, certifying the SOS criterion remains computationally\nexpensive and often involves solving a Semidefinite Program (SDP), whose\ndimensionality grows quadratically in the size of the monomial basis of the SOS\nexpression; hence, various methods to reduce the size of the monomial basis\nhave been proposed. In this work, we introduce the first learning-augmented\nalgorithm to certify the SOS criterion. To this end, we train a Transformer\nmodel that predicts an almost-minimal monomial basis for a given polynomial,\nthereby drastically reducing the size of the corresponding SDP. Our overall\nmethodology comprises three key components: efficient training dataset\ngeneration of over 100 million SOS polynomials, design and training of the\ncorresponding Transformer architecture, and a systematic fallback mechanism to\nensure correct termination, which we analyze theoretically.

Most existing deep\nlearning methods for epilepsy detection rely solely on unimodal EEG signals,\nneglecting the potential benefits of multimodal information. To address this,\nwe propose a novel multimodal model, DistilCLIP-EEG, based on the CLIP\nframework, which integrates both EEG signals and text descriptions to capture\ncomprehensive features of epileptic seizures. The model involves an EEG encoder\nbased on the Conformer architecture as a text encoder, the proposed Learnable\nBERT (BERT-LP) as prompt learning within the encoders.

A manually specified reward function can yield policies that\nare highly suboptimal under the ground-truth objective, yet corrections on only\na few transitions may suffice to recover optimal performance. To identify and\ncorrect for those transitions, PBRR uses a targeted exploration strategy and a\nnew preference-learning objective. We prove in tabular domains PBRR has a\ncumulative regret that matches, up to constants, that of prior preference-based\nRL methods. In addition, on a suite of reward-hacking benchmarks, PBRR\nconsistently outperforms baselines that learn a reward function from scratch\nfrom preferences or modify the proxy reward function using other approaches,\nrequiring substantially fewer preferences to learn high performing policies."}

The algorithm accounts for the\napproximation errors due to the learning directly at the synthesis stage,\nensuring recursive feasibility by construction. The optimal control problem\nconsists of a linear noisy dynamical system, a quadratic stage and quadratic\nterminal costs as the objective, and convex constraints on the state, control,\nand disturbance sequences; the control minimizes and the disturbance maximizes\nthe objective. We proceed via two steps -- (a) Data generation: First, we\nreformulate the given minmax problem into a convex semi-infinite program and\nemploy recently developed tools to solve it in an exact fashion on grid points\nof the state space to generate (state, action) data. (b) Learning approximate\nfeedback maps: We employ a couple of approximation schemes that furnish tight\napproximations within preassigned uniform error bounds on the admissible state\nspace to learn the unknown feedback policy. The stability of the closed-loop\nsystem under the approximate feedback policies is also guaranteed under a\nstandard set of hypotheses. Two benchmark numerical examples are provided to\nillustrate the results."}

However, current methods for building assistive agents, whether via\nmimicking expert humans or via RL finetuning on an inferred reward, often\nencourage agents to complete tasks on their own rather than truly assisting the\nhuman attain their objectives. Additionally, these methods often require costly\nexplicit human feedback to provide a training signal. We propose a new approach\nto tuning assistive language models based on maximizing the human's\nempowerment, their ability to effect desired changes in the environment. Our\nempowerment-maximizing method, Empower, only requires offline text data,\nproviding a self-supervised method for fine-tuning language models to better\nassist humans. To study the efficacy of our approach, we conducted an 18-person\nuser study comparing our empowerment assistant with a strong baseline.\nParticipants preferred our assistant 78% of the time (p=0.015), with a 31%\nhigher acceptance rate and 38% fewer suggestions. Additionally, we introduce a\nnew environment for evaluating multi-turn code assistance using simulated\nhumans. Using this environment, we show that agents trained with Empower\nincrease the success rate of a simulated human programmer on challenging coding\nquestions by an average of 192% over an SFT baseline.
