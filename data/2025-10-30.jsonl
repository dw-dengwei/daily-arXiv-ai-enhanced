We present Fortytwo, a\nnovel protocol that leverages swarm intelligence principles and distributed\npairwise ranking consensus to achieve superior performance in AI inference. Our\napproach reimagines collaboration among AI nodes using swarm inference: a\npeer-ranked, reputation-weighted consensus across heterogeneous models that\nsurfaces the highest-quality responses. Using pairwise ranking with a custom\nBradley-Terry-style aggregation model, we demonstrate that swarm inference\nsubstantially outperforms majority voting, achieving 85.90% on GPQA Diamond\nversus 68.69% for majority voting with the same model set - an improvement of\n+17.21 percentage points (approximately +25.1% relative). The protocol\nincorporates on-chain reputation so node influence adapts to demonstrated\naccuracy over time, yielding a meritocratic consensus that filters low-quality\nor malicious participants. To resist Sybil attacks, Fortytwo employs\nproof-of-capability in its consensus: nodes must successfully complete\ncalibration/test requests and stake reputation to enter ranking rounds, making\nmulti-identity attacks economically unattractive while preserving openness.\nAcross six challenging benchmarks, including GPQA Diamond, LiveCodeBench, and\nAIME, our evaluation indicates higher accuracy and strong resilience to\nadversarial and noisy free-form prompting (e.g., prompt-injection degradation\nof only 0.12% versus 6.20% for a monolithic single-model baseline), while\nretaining practical deployability.

These reasoning steps in\nCoT are often assumed as a faithful reflection of the model's internal thinking\nprocess, and used to monitor unsafe intentions. However, we find many reasoning\nsteps don't truly contribute to LLMs' prediction. We measure the step-wise\ncausal influence of each reasoning step on the model's final prediction with a\nproposed True Thinking Score (TTS). We reveal that LLMs often interleave\nbetween true-thinking steps (which are genuinely used to produce the final\noutput) and decorative-thinking steps (which only give the appearance of\nreasoning but have minimal causal impact). Notably, only a small subset of the\ntotal reasoning steps have a high TTS that causally drive the model's\nprediction: e.g., for the AIME dataset, only an average of 2.3% of reasoning\nsteps in CoT have a TTS >= 0.7 (range: 0-1) under the Qwen-2.5 model.\nFurthermore, we identify a TrueThinking direction in the latent space of LLMs.\nBy steering along or against this direction, we can force the model to perform\nor disregard certain CoT steps when computing the final result. Finally, we\nhighlight that self-verification steps in CoT (i.e., aha moments) can also be\ndecorative, where LLMs do not truly verify their solution.

We introduce Graph-based Agent\nPlanning (GAP), a novel framework that explicitly models inter-task\ndependencies through graph-based planning to enable adaptive parallel and\nserial tool execution. Our approach trains agent foundation models to decompose\ncomplex tasks into dependency-aware sub-task graphs, autonomously determining\nwhich tools can be executed in parallel and which must follow sequential\ndependencies. This dependency-aware orchestration achieves substantial\nimprovements in both execution efficiency and task accuracy. To train GAP, we\nconstruct a high-quality dataset of graph-based planning traces derived from\nthe Multi-Hop Question Answering (MHQA) benchmark.

Our approach was evaluated using the CHB-MIT\nScalp EEG Database, which includes 969 hours of recordings and 173 seizures\ncollected from 23 pediatric and young adult patients with drug-resistant\nepilepsy. To support seizure detection, we implemented a range of supervised\nmachine learning algorithms, including K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic\nRegression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine. The Logistic Regression\nachieved 90.9% detection accuracy with 89.6% recall, demonstrating balanced\nperformance suitable for clinical screening. Random Forest and Support Vector\nMachine models achieved higher accuracy (94.0%) but with 0% recall, failing to\ndetect any seizures, illustrating that accuracy alone is insufficient for\nevaluating medical ML models with class imbalance. For seizure prediction, we\nemployed Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, which use deep learning to\nmodel temporal dependencies in EEG data. The LSTM model achieved 89.26%\nprediction accuracy. These results highlight the potential of developing\naccessible, real-time monitoring tools that not only detect seizures as\ntraditionally done, but also predict them before they occur.

The CPD module is trained\nusing heuristic pseudo-labels derived from intrinsic signals to infer latent\nshifts in environment dynamics without external supervision.

The overall optimization objective enhances the\nstandard actor-critic loss using structure-aware auxiliary losses.

The cornerstone\nof TheraMind is a novel dual-loop architecture that decouples the complex\ncounseling process into an Intra-Session Loop for tactical dialogue management\nand a Cross-Session Loop for strategic therapeutic planning.

The\ngoverning partial differential equations (PDEs) for these systems are often\nintractable to derive from first principles, due to their inherent complexity,\ncharacterized by high-order derivatives and strong nonlinearities, coupled with\nincomplete physical knowledge. This has spurred the development of data-driven\nmethods, yet these approaches face limitations: Purely data-driven models are\noften physically inconsistent and data-intensive, while existing\nphysics-informed methods lack the structural capacity to represent complex\noperators or systematically integrate partial physical knowledge. Here, we\npropose a hierarchical physics-embedded learning framework that fundamentally\nadvances both the forward spatiotemporal prediction and inverse discovery of\nphysical laws from sparse and noisy data. The key innovation is a two-level\narchitecture that mirrors the process of scientific discovery: the first level\nlearns fundamental symbolic components of a PDE, while the second learns their\ngoverning combinations.

Although over-approximation\nmethods have shown success in neural network verification to address this\nchallenge, reducing approximation errors remains a significant obstacle.\nFurthermore, these approximation errors hinder the ability to obtain tight\nlocal Lipschitz constants, which are crucial for certified robustness.\nOriginally, grafting linearity into non-linear activation functions was\nproposed to reduce the number of unstable neurons, enabling scalable and\ncomplete verification. However, no prior theoretical analysis has explained how\nlinearity grafting improves certified robustness. We instead consider linearity\ngrafting primarily as a means of eliminating approximation errors rather than\nreducing the number of unstable neurons, since linear functions do not require\nrelaxation. In this paper, we provide two theoretical contributions: 1) why\nlinearity grafting improves certified robustness through the lens of the\n$l_\\infty$ local Lipschitz constant, and 2) grafting linearity into non-linear\nactivation functions, the dominant source of approximation errors, yields a\ntighter local Lipschitz constant.

For the multiple operator case, we\nintroduce two new architectures, $\\mathrm{MNO}$ and $\\mathrm{MONet}$, and\nestablish universal approximation results in three settings: continuous,\nintegrable, or Lipschitz operators. For the latter, we further derive explicit\nscaling laws that quantify how the network size must grow to achieve a target\napproximation accuracy.

This paper fills that gap by systematically\ninvestigating the trade-offs between FP and INT formats.

Our\ncomprehensive comparison demonstrates that for popular 8-bit fine-grained\nformats (e.g., MX with block size 32), MXINT8 is superior to its FP counterpart\nin both algorithmic accuracy and hardware efficiency.

Recently,\ntransformer-based models leveraging the attention mechanism have demonstrated\nstrong empirical success in capturing complex dependencies within graphs.\nHowever, the theoretical understanding of their training dynamics has been\nlimited to tree-like graphs, where each node depends on a single parent.\nExtending provable guarantees to more general directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) --\nwhich involve multiple parents per node -- remains challenging, primarily due\nto the difficulty in designing training objectives that enable different\nattention heads to separately learn multiple different parent relationships.\n  In this work, we address this problem by introducing a novel\ninformation-theoretic metric: the kernel-guided mutual information (KG-MI),\nbased on the $f$-divergence. Our objective combines KG-MI with a multi-head\nattention framework, where each head is associated with a distinct marginal\ntransition kernel to model diverse parent-child dependencies effectively.

However, conventional MIL approaches treat instances\nseparately, ignoring contextual relationships such as the appearance of nearby\npatches or slices that can be essential in real applications. We design a\nsynthetic classification task where accounting for adjacent instance features\nis crucial for accurate prediction. We demonstrate the limitations of\noff-the-shelf MIL approaches by quantifying their performance compared to the\noptimal Bayes estimator for this task, which is available in closed-form. We\nempirically show that newer correlated MIL methods still struggle to generalize\nas well as possible when trained from scratch on tens of thousands of\ninstances."}

Traditional approaches require costly numerical solvers to sample\nbetween arbitrary time points.

This enables one-shot sampling\nbetween arbitrary states and yields up to two orders of magnitude speed-ups at\nlarge time gaps. Experiments on synthetic SDE simulations and on real-world\ntracking and video data show that NSFs maintain distributional accuracy\ncomparable to numerical approaches while dramatically reducing computation for\narbitrary time-point sampling."}

Typically, our analysis reveals\nthat a multi-mode degeneracy consistently occurs at the critical number 0,\nindependent of k.

For tasks beyond the LLM's current competence, such reasoning path\ncan be hard to sample, and learning risks reinforcing familiar but suboptimal\nreasoning. We are motivated by the insight from cognitive science that Why is\nthis the answer is often an easier question than What is the answer, as it\navoids the heavy cognitive load of open-ended exploration, opting instead for\nexplanatory reconstruction-systematically retracing the reasoning that links a\nquestion to its answer. We show that LLMs can similarly leverage answers to\nderive high-quality reasoning paths. We formalize this phenomenon and prove\nthat conditioning on answer provably increases the expected utility of sampled\nreasoning paths, thereby transforming intractable problems into learnable ones.\nBuilding on this insight, we introduce RAVR (Reference-Answer-guided\nVariational Reasoning), an end-to-end framework that uses answer-conditioned\nreasoning as a variational surrogate for question-only reasoning. Experiments\nin both general and math domains demonstrate consistent improvements over\nstrong baselines. We further analyze the reasoning behavior and find that RAVR\nreduces hesitation, strengthens conclusion consolidation, and promotes\nproblem-specific strategies in reasoning."}

This survey cuts through this confusion by introducing\na novel dual-paradigm framework that categorizes agentic systems into two\ndistinct lineages: the Symbolic/Classical (relying on algorithmic planning and\npersistent state) and the Neural/Generative (leveraging stochastic generation\nand prompt-driven orchestration). Through a systematic PRISMA-based review of\n90 studies (2018--2025), we provide a comprehensive analysis structured around\nthis framework across three dimensions: (1) the theoretical foundations and\narchitectural principles defining each paradigm; (2) domain-specific\nimplementations in healthcare, finance, and robotics, demonstrating how\napplication constraints dictate paradigm selection; and (3) paradigm-specific\nethical and governance challenges, revealing divergent risks and mitigation\nstrategies. Our analysis reveals that the choice of paradigm is strategic:\nsymbolic systems dominate safety-critical domains (e.g., healthcare), while\nneural systems prevail in adaptive, data-rich environments (e.g., finance).\nFurthermore, we identify critical research gaps, including a significant\ndeficit in governance models for symbolic systems and a pressing need for\nhybrid neuro-symbolic architectures. The findings culminate in a strategic\nroadmap arguing that the future of Agentic AI lies not in the dominance of one\nparadigm, but in their intentional integration to create systems that are both\nadaptable and reliable.
