We develop two new $f$-DP-based accounting methods\ntailored to decentralized settings: Pairwise Network $f$-DP (PN-$f$-DP), which\nquantifies privacy leakage between user pairs under random-walk communication,\nand Secret-based $f$-Local DP (Sec-$f$-LDP), which supports structured noise\ninjection via shared secrets. By combining tools from $f$-DP theory and Markov\nchain concentration, our accounting framework captures privacy amplification\narising from sparse communication, local iterations, and correlated noise.\nExperiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our methods yield\nconsistently tighter $(\\epsilon,\\delta)$ bounds and improved utility compared\nto R\\'enyi DP-based approaches, illustrating the benefits of $f$-DP in\ndecentralized privacy accounting."}

A natural question is: How can we justify this additional compute\nwhen left-to-right one-token-at-a-time decoding is on par with any-order\ndecoding algorithms? First, we propose reasoning-as-infilling. By using MDLMs\nto infill a reasoning template, we can structure outputs and distinguish\nbetween reasoning and answer tokens. In turn, this enables measuring answer\nuncertainty during reasoning, and early exits when the model converges on an\nanswer. Next, given an answer, reasoning-as-infilling enables sampling from the\nMDLM posterior over reasoning traces conditioned on the answer, providing a new\nsource of high-quality data for post-training.

To enhance the model's\nability for tool-usage and multi-step reasoning, we further design a novel EQA\ndata generation pipeline that automatically constructs large-scale EQA tasks\nwith reasoning trajectories and corresponding answers.

Current learning-based decoding approaches fall into two\nclasses: simple, causal models that lack generalization, or complex, non-causal\nmodels that generalize and scale offline but struggle in real-time settings.\nBoth face a common challenge, their reliance on power-hungry artificial neural\nnetwork backbones, which makes integration into real-world, resource-limited\nsystems difficult. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer a promising\nalternative. Because they operate causally these models are suitable for\nreal-time use, and their low energy demands make them ideal for\nbattery-constrained environments. To this end, we introduce Spikachu: a\nscalable, causal, and energy-efficient neural decoding framework based on SNNs.\nOur approach processes binned spikes directly by projecting them into a shared\nlatent space, where spiking modules, adapted to the timing of the input,\nextract relevant features; these latent representations are then integrated and\ndecoded to generate behavioral predictions. We evaluate our approach on 113\nrecording sessions from 6 non-human primates, totaling 43 hours of recordings.\nOur method outperforms causal baselines when trained on single sessions using\nbetween 2.26 and 418.81 times less energy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that\nscaling up training to multiple sessions and subjects improves performance and\nenables few-shot transfer to unseen sessions, subjects, and tasks. Overall,\nSpikachu introduces a scalable, online-compatible neural decoding framework\nbased on SNNs, whose performance is competitive relative to state-of-the-art\nmodels while consuming orders of magnitude less energy."}

However, anomaly prediction in semiconductor fabrication\npresents several critical challenges, including high dimensionality of sensor\ndata and severe class imbalance due to the rarity of true faults. Furthermore,\nthe complex interdependencies between variables complicate both anomaly\nprediction and root-cause-analysis. This paper proposes two novel approaches to\nadvance the field from anomaly detection to anomaly prediction, an essential\nstep toward enabling real-time process correction and proactive fault\nprevention. The proposed anomaly prediction framework contains two main stages:\n(a) training a forecasting model on a dataset assumed to contain no anomalies,\nand (b) performing forecast on unseen time series data. The forecast is\ncompared with the forecast of the trained signal. Deviations beyond a\npredefined threshold are flagged as anomalies. The two approaches differ in the\nforecasting model employed. The first assumes independence between variables by\nutilizing the N-BEATS model for univariate time series forecasting. The second\nlifts this assumption by utilizing a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to capture\ninter-variable relationships. Both models demonstrate strong forecasting\nperformance up to a horizon of 20 time points and maintain stable anomaly\nprediction up to 50 time points. The GNN consistently outperforms the N-BEATS\nmodel while requiring significantly fewer trainable parameters and lower\ncomputational cost.

We demonstrate that this overhead can be removed and find that: (i)\nOnly a small, carefully chosen subset of matrices needs to be inspected --\neliminating the layer-by-layer sweep, (ii) The gradient of each matrix's\nsingular values pinpoints which matrices merit reduction, (iii) Increasing the\nfactorization search space by allowing matrices rows to cluster around multiple\nsubspaces and then decomposing each cluster separately further reduces\noverfitting on the original training data and further lifts accuracy by up to\n24.6 percentage points, and finally, (iv) we discover that evaluating on just\n100 samples rather than the full training data -- both for computing the\nindicative gradients and for measuring the final accuracy -- suffices to\nfurther reduce the search time; we explain that as adaptation to downstream\ntasks is dominated by prompting style, not dataset size. As a result, we show\nthat combining these findings yields a fast and robust adaptation algorithm for\ndownstream tasks. Overall, with a single gradient step on 100 examples and a\nquick scan of the top candidate layers and factorization techniques, we can\nadapt LLMs to new datasets -- entirely without fine-tuning."}

We show -- mathematically and empirically -- that this intuition does\nnot necessarily transfer well to doing reinforcement learning with\nreverse/forward KL regularization (e.g. as commonly used with language models).\nInstead, the choice of reverse/forward KL determines the family of optimal\ntarget distributions, parameterized by the regularization coefficient. Mode\ncoverage depends primarily on other factors, such as regularization strength,\nand relative scales between rewards and reference probabilities. Further, we\nshow commonly used settings such as low regularization strength and equal\nverifiable rewards tend to specify unimodal target distributions, meaning the\noptimization objective is, by construction, non-diverse. We leverage these\ninsights to construct a simple, scalable, and theoretically justified\nalgorithm. It makes minimal changes to reward magnitudes, yet optimizes for a\ntarget distribution which puts high probability over all high-quality sampling\nmodes. In experiments, this simple modification works to post-train both Large\nLanguage Models and Chemical Language Models to have higher solution quality\nand diversity, without any external signals of diversity, and works with both\nforward and reverse KL when using either naively fails."}

Within this\nframework, we introduce logical closeness, a metric that quantifies how well a\nmodel's CoT trajectory (i.e., the LLM's final output) adheres to the DAG\nstructure, providing evaluation beyond classical PASS@k metrics. Building on\nthis, we introduce the DAG-MATH CoT format and construct a benchmark that\nguides LLMs to generate CoT trajectories in this format, thereby enabling the\nevaluation of their reasoning ability under our framework. Across standard\nmathematical reasoning datasets, our analysis uncovers statistically\nsignificant differences in reasoning fidelity among representative LLM\nfamilies-even when PASS@k is comparable-highlighting gaps between final-answer\naccuracy and rule-consistent derivation.

RELATE employs shared\nmodality-specific encoders for categorical, numerical, textual, and temporal\nattributes, followed by a Perceiver-style cross-attention module that\naggregates features into a fixed-size, permutation-invariant node\nrepresentation.
