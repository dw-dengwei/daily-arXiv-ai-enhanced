Previous work proposed a framework consisting of\nthree steps: the LLM first generates a summary and then a strategy for the\ndomain, both in natural language, and then implements that strategy as a Python\nprogram, that gets debugged on example planning tasks. In that work, only one\nstrategy is generated and passed directly to the program generation. If the\nstrategy is incorrect, its implementation will therefore result in an incorrect\ngeneralized plan. Here, we introduce an approach that generates the strategy in\nthe form of pseudocode and enables automatic debugging of the pseudocode, hence\nallowing us to identify and fix errors prior to the generation of the\ngeneralized plan itself. Additionally, we extend the Python debugging phase\nwith a reflection step prompting the LLM to pinpoint the reason for the\nobserved plan failure. Finally, we take inspiration from LLM code generation to\nproduce several program variants and pick the best one. Running experiments on\n17 benchmark domains, we show that these extensions substantially improve (and\nnever deteriorate) the quality of the generalized plans. In 12 of the domains,\nour best Python programs solve all tasks that can be generated with the\nrespective instance generator.", "AI": {"tldr": "Proposes improvements to LLM-assisted generation of generalized plans in PDDL by using pseudocode strategy, automatic debugging, reflection, and multiple program variants; shows improvements across 17 domains, with best programs solving all tasks in 12 domains.", "motivation": "Address limitations of a single natural-language strategy guiding code generation, and reduce errors in implementing generalized plans; aim to increase reliability and quality of LLM-driven planning across tasks.", "method": "Introduce a workflow where the strategy is generated as pseudocode and separately debugged; add a reflection step for diagnosing plan failures; generate multiple program variants and select the best; evaluate on 17 benchmark PDDL domains.", "result": "Extensions substantially improve plan quality and never deteriorate it; in 12 domains, the best Python programs solve all tasks that can be generated with the respective instance generators.", "conclusion": "The combination of pseudocode strategy, debugging/reflection, and multiple variants robustifies LLM-guided generalized planning in PDDL, enabling error detection and correction before plan generation and improving generalization across domains."}}
