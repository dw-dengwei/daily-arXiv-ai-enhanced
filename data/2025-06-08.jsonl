With our work here, we define a process for\ncalibrating a robot for OIO that generalizes to several olfaction sensor types.\nOur focus is specifically on calibrating OIO for centimeter-level accuracy in\nlocalizing an odor source on a slow-moving robot platform to demonstrate use\ncases in robotic surgery and touchless security screening. We demonstrate our\nprocess for OIO calibration on a real robotic arm and show how this calibration\nimproves performance over a cold-start olfactory navigation task."}

High-speed\nnumerical simulators for such circuits are crucial for advancing research in\nthis field. In this work, we numerically benchmark universal and gate-specific\ntechniques for simulating the action of layers of gates on quantum state\nvectors, aiming to accelerate the overall simulation of Quantum Machine\nLearning algorithms. Our analysis shows that the optimal simulation method for\na given layer of gates depends on the number of qubits involved, and that a\ntailored combination of techniques can yield substantial performance gains in\nthe forward and backward passes for a given circuit. Building on these\ninsights, we developed a numerical simulator, named TQml Simulator, that\nemploys the most efficient simulation method for each layer in a given circuit.\nWe evaluated TQml Simulator on circuits constructed from standard gate sets,\nsuch as rotations and CNOTs, as well as on native gates from IonQ and IBM\nquantum processing units. In most cases, our simulator outperforms equivalent\nPennylane's default.qubit simulator by approximately 2- to 100-fold, depending\non the circuit, the number of qubits, the batch size of the input data, and the\nhardware used."}

We visualized venous-phase liver computed\ntomography and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography scans from the CHAOS\nand MRCP\\_DLRecon datasets. Fourteen medical experts assessed usability and\nanticipated clinical integration potential using the System Usability Scale,\nISONORM 9242-110-S questionnaire, and an open-ended survey. Their feedback\nidentified feasibility, key usability strengths, and required features to\ncatalyze the adaptation in real-world clinical workflows. The findings provide\ninsights into the potential of immersive cinematic rendering in medical\nimaging."}
