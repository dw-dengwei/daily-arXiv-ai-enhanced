It is widely recognized that achieving\nhuman-like efficiency and robustness manipulation requires the robotic brain to\nintegrate a comprehensive set of functions, such as task planning, policy\ngeneration, anomaly monitoring and handling, and long-term memory, achieving\nhigh-efficiency operation across all functions. Vision-Language Models (VLMs),\npretrained on massive multimodal data, have acquired rich world knowledge,\nexhibiting exceptional scene understanding and multimodal reasoning\ncapabilities. However, existing methods typically focus on realizing only a\nsingle function or a subset of functions within the robotic brain, without\nintegrating them into a unified cognitive architecture. Inspired by a\ndivide-and-conquer strategy and the architecture of the human brain, we propose\nFrankenBot, a VLM-driven, brain-morphic robotic manipulation framework that\nachieves both comprehensive functionality and high operational efficiency. Our\nframework includes a suite of components, decoupling a part of key functions\nfrom frequent VLM calls, striking an optimal balance between functional\ncompleteness and system efficiency. Specifically, we map task planning, policy\ngeneration, memory management, and low-level interfacing to the cortex,\ncerebellum, temporal lobe-hippocampus complex, and brainstem, respectively, and\ndesign efficient coordination mechanisms for the modules. We conducted\ncomprehensive experiments in both simulation and real-world robotic\nenvironments, demonstrating that our method offers significant advantages in\nanomaly detection and handling, long-term memory, operational efficiency, and\nstability -- all without requiring any fine-tuning or retraining."}
