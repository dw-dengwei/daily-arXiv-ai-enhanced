Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into biomedical
research workflows--from literature triage and hypothesis generation to
experimental design--yet this expanded utility also heightens dual-use
concerns, including the potential misuse for guiding toxic compound synthesis.
In response, this study shows a Biosecurity Agent that comprises four
coordinated modes across the model lifecycle: dataset sanitization, preference
alignment, run-time guardrails, and automated red teaming. For dataset
sanitization (Mode 1), evaluation is conducted on CORD-19, a COVID-19 Open
Research Dataset of coronavirus-related scholarly articles. We define three
sanitization tiers--L1 (compact, high-precision), L2 (human-curated biosafety
terms), and L3 (comprehensive union)--with removal rates rising from 0.46% to
70.40%, illustrating the safety-utility trade-off. For preference alignment
(Mode 2), DPO with LoRA adapters internalizes refusals and safe completions,
reducing end-to-end attack success rate (ASR) from 59.7% to 3.0%. At inference
(Mode 3), run-time guardrails across L1-L3 show the expected security-usability
trade-off: L2 achieves the best balance (F1 = 0.720, precision = 0.900, recall
= 0.600, FPR =0.067), while L3 offers stronger jailbreak resistance at the cost
of higher false positives. Under continuous automated red-teaming (Mode 4), no
successful jailbreaks are observed under the tested protocol. Taken together,
our biosecurity agent offers an auditable, lifecycle-aligned framework that
reduces attack success while preserving benign utility, providing safeguards
for the use of LLMs in scientific research and setting a precedent for future
agent-level security protections.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Industrial Control Systems (ICS) face growing cyber-physical attacks that
exploit both network vulnerabilities and physical processes. Current anomaly
detection methods rely on correlation-based analysis, which cannot separate
true causal relationships from spurious associations. This limitation results
in high false alarm rates and poor root cause analysis. We propose a novel
Causal Digital Twin (CDT) framework for cyber-physical security in medium-scale
ICS. Our method combines causal inference theory with digital twin modeling.
The framework enables three types of causal reasoning: association for pattern
detection, intervention for understanding system responses, and counterfactual
analysis for attack prevention planning. We evaluate our framework on three
industrial datasets: SWaT, WADI, and HAI, with validation through physical
constraint compliance (90.8\%) and synthetic ground truth testing (structural
Hamming distance 0.13). Results show significant improvements over seven
baseline methods. Our CDT achieves F1-scores are $0.944 \pm 0.014$ for SWaT,
$0.902 \pm 0.021$ for WADI, and $0.923 \pm 0.018$ for HAI with statistical
significance ($p < 0.0024$, Bonferroni corrected). The framework reduces false
positives by \SI{74}{\percent} and achieves \SI{78.4}{\percent} root cause
analysis accuracy compared to \SI{48.7}{\percent} for existing methods.
Counterfactual analysis enables defense strategies that reduce attack success
by \SI{73.2}{\percent}. The system keeps real-time performance with
\SI{3.2}{ms} latency, which is suitable for industrial deployment, while
providing interpretable explanations for operators.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: ChipmunkRing, a practical post-quantum ring signature construction tailored
for blockchain environments. Building on our Chipmunk lattice-based
cryptographic framework, this implementation delivers compact digital
signatures ranging from 20.5 to 279.7KB, with rapid signing operations
completing in 1.1-15.1ms and efficient validation processes requiring only
0.4-4.5ms for participant groups of 2-64 members. The cornerstone of our
approach is Acorn Verification-a streamlined zero-knowledge protocol that
supersedes the classical Fiat-Shamir methodology. This innovation enables
linear O(n) authentication complexity using concise 96-byte cryptographic
proofs per participant, yielding a remarkable 17.7x performance enhancement for
32-member rings when compared to conventional techniques. Our work includes
rigorous mathematical security demonstrations confirming 112-bit post-quantum
protection (NIST Level 1), extensive computational benchmarking, and
comprehensive support for both standard anonymity sets and collaborative
threshold constructions with flexible participation requirements.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We present a risk-calibrated approach to streaming intrusion detection that
couples Bayesian Online Changepoint Detection (BOCPD) with decision thresholds
aligned to Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) error budgets. BOCPD provides
run-length posteriors that adapt to distribution shift and concept drift; we
map these posteriors to alert decisions by optimizing expected operational cost
under false-positive and false-negative budgets. We detail the hazard model,
conjugate updates, and an O(1)-per-event implementation. A concrete SRE example
shows how a 99.9% availability SLO (43.2 minutes per month error budget) yields
a probability threshold near 0.91 when missed incidents are 10x more costly
than false alarms. We evaluate on the full UNSW-NB15 and CIC-IDS2017 benchmarks
with chronological splits, comparing against strong unsupervised baselines
(ECOD, COPOD, and LOF). Metrics include PR-AUC, ROC-AUC, Brier score,
calibration reliability diagrams, and detection latency measured in events.
Results indicate improved precision-recall at mid to high recall and better
probability calibration relative to baselines. We release implementation
details, hyperparameters, and ablations for hazard sensitivity and
computational footprint. Code and reproducibility materials will be made
available upon publication; datasets and implementation are available from the
corresponding author upon reasonable request.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The excitement brought by the development of AI agents came alongside arising
problems. These concerns centered around users' trust issues towards AIs, the
risks involved, and the difficulty of attributing responsibilities and
liabilities. Current solutions only attempt to target each problem separately
without acknowledging their inter-influential nature. The Trust, Risk and
Liability (TRL) framework proposed in this paper, however, ties together the
interdependent relationships of trust, risk, and liability to provide a
systematic method of building and enhancing trust, analyzing and mitigating
risks, and allocating and attributing liabilities. It can be applied to analyze
any application scenarios of AI agents and suggest appropriate measures fitting
to the context. The implications of the TRL framework lie in its potential
societal impacts, economic impacts, ethical impacts, and more. It is expected
to bring remarkable values to addressing potential challenges and promoting
trustworthy, risk-free, and responsible usage of AI in 6G networks.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The Metaverse utilizes emerging technologies such as Extended Reality (XR),
Artificial Intelligence (AI), blockchain, and digital twins to provide an
immersive and interactive virtual experience. As Metaverse continues to evolve,
it bring a range of security and privacy threats, such as identity management,
data governance, and user interactions. This survey aims to provide a
comprehensive review of the enabling technologies for the Metaverse. It also
aims to provide a thorough analysis of key vulnerabilities and threats that may
compromise its sustainability and user safety. We perform a systematic
literature review (SLR) to identify key vulnerabilities and their
countermeasures in Metaverse platforms. Metaverse offers a much larger attack
surface compared to conventional digital platforms. Immersive, decentralized,
and permanent characteristics of the Metaverse generate new vulnerabilities.
Although there are many countermeasures to these vulnerabilities, most of them
are theoretical or have not been tested in real-world environments. Our review
highlights current advancements, identifies research gaps, and outlines future
directions to ensure a secure, resilient, and ethically governed Metaverse.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: With the proliferation of new blockchain-based cryptocurrencies/assets and
platforms that make it possible to transact across them, it becomes important
to consider not just whether the transfer of coins/assets can be tracked within
their respective transaction ledger, but also if they can be tracked as they
move across ledgers. This is especially important given that there are
documented cases of criminals attempting to use these cross-ledger trades to
obscure the flow of their coins/assets. In this paper, we perform a systematic
review of the various tracing techniques for blockchain transactions proposed
in literature, categorize them using multiple criteria (such as tracing
approach and targeted objective) and compare them. Based on the above
categorization, we provide insights on the state of blockchain transaction
tracing literature and identify the limitations of existing approaches.
Finally, we suggest directions for future research in this area based on our
analysis.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The growing use of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies in Nigerian
healthcare offers potential improvements in remote monitoring and data-driven
care, but unsecured wireless communication in medical IoT (mIoT) devices
exposes patient data to cyber threats. This study investigates such
vulnerabilities through a real-time Man in the Middle (MITM) attack simulation
and evaluates lightweight AES-128 encryption on low-cost devices.
  A prototype mIoT device was built with a NodeMCU ESP8266 and sensors for
heart rate and temperature. In controlled lab conditions simulating local
healthcare networks, unencrypted data transmissions were intercepted and
altered using common tools (Bettercap, Wireshark). After AES-128 encryption was
applied, all transmissions became unreadable and tamper attempts failed,
demonstrating its effectiveness.
  Performance costs were modest, latency rose from 80 ms to 125 ms (56.25
percent increase) and CPU use from 30 percent to 45 percent, but system
stability remained intact. Device cost stayed under 18,000 NGN (about 12 USD),
making it feasible for Nigeria's resource constrained facilities.
  A survey of healthcare professionals showed moderate awareness of IoT-related
risks but strong support for encryption and staff training. Barriers included
limited budgets and technical complexity.
  The study concludes that lightweight AES-128 encryption provides practical,
low-cost protection against common attack vectors while maintaining operational
efficiency. Feedback from professionals highlights the urgency of improving
security awareness and establishing guidelines for clinical deployment.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Hound introduces a relation-first graph engine that improves system-level
reasoning across interrelated components in complex codebases. The agent
designs flexible, analyst-defined views with compact annotations (e.g.,
monetary/value flows, authentication/authorization roles, call graphs, protocol
invariants) and uses them to anchor exact retrieval: for any question, it loads
precisely the code that matters (often across components) so it can zoom out to
system structure and zoom in to the decisive lines. A second contribution is a
persistent belief system: long-lived vulnerability hypotheses whose confidence
is updated as evidence accrues. The agent employs coverage-versus-intuition
planning and a QA finalizer to confirm or reject hypotheses. On a five-project
subset of ScaBench[1], Hound improves recall and F1 over a baseline LLM
analyzer (micro recall 31.2% vs. 8.3%; F1 14.2% vs. 9.8%) with a modest
precision trade-off. We attribute these gains to flexible, relation-first
graphs that extend model understanding beyond call/dataflow to abstract
aspects, plus the hypothesis-centric loop; code and artifacts are released to
support reproduction.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: This paper presents the Cybersecurity Psychology Framework (CPF), a novel
methodology for quantifying human-centric vulnerabilities in security
operations through systematic integration of established psychological
constructs with operational security telemetry. While individual human
factors-alert fatigue, compliance fatigue, cognitive overload, and risk
perception biases-have been extensively studied in isolation, no framework
provides end-to-end operationalization across the full spectrum of
psychological vulnerabilities. We address this gap by: (1) defining specific,
measurable algorithms that quantify key psychological states using standard SOC
tooling (SIEM, ticketing systems, communication platforms); (2) proposing a
lightweight, privacy-preserving LLM architecture based on Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) and domain-specific fine-tuning to analyze structured and
unstructured data for latent psychological risks; (3) detailing a rigorous
mixed-methods validation strategy acknowledging the inherent difficulty of
obtaining sensitive cybersecurity data. Our implementation of CPF indicators
has been demonstrated in a proof-of-concept deployment using small language
models achieving 0.92 F1-score on synthetic data. This work provides the
theoretical and methodological foundation necessary for industry partnerships
to conduct empirical validation with real operational data.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Password security has been compelled to evolve in response to the growing
computational capabilities of modern systems. However, this evolution has often
resulted in increasingly complex security practices that alienate users,
leading to poor compliance and heightened vulnerability. Consequently,
individuals remain exposed to attackers through weak or improperly managed
passwords, underscoring the urgent need for a comprehensive defense mechanism
that effectively addresses password-related risks and threats. In this paper,
we propose a multifaceted solution designed to revolutionize password security
by integrating diverse attributes such as the Password Dissection Mechanism,
Dynamic Password Policy Mechanism, human behavioral patterns, device
characteristics, network parameters, geographical context, and other relevant
factors. By leveraging learning-based models, our framework constructs detailed
user profiles capable of recognizing individuals and preventing nearly all
forms of unauthorized access or device possession. The proposed framework
enhances the usability-security paradigm by offering stronger protection than
existing standards while simultaneously engaging users in the policy-setting
process through a novel, adaptive approach.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Model quantization is a popular technique for deploying deep learning models
on resource-constrained environments. However, it may also introduce previously
overlooked security risks. In this work, we present QuRA, a novel backdoor
attack that exploits model quantization to embed malicious behaviors. Unlike
conventional backdoor attacks relying on training data poisoning or model
training manipulation, QuRA solely works using the quantization operations. In
particular, QuRA first employs a novel weight selection strategy to identify
critical weights that influence the backdoor target (with the goal of
perserving the model's overall performance in mind). Then, by optimizing the
rounding direction of these weights, we amplify the backdoor effect across
model layers without degrading accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
QuRA achieves nearly 100% attack success rates in most cases, with negligible
performance degradation. Furthermore, we show that QuRA can adapt to bypass
existing backdoor defenses, underscoring its threat potential. Our findings
highlight critical vulnerability in widely used model quantization process,
emphasizing the need for more robust security measures. Our implementation is
available at https://github.com/cxx122/QuRA.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We address the problem of auditing whether sensitive or copyrighted texts
were used to fine-tune large language models (LLMs) under black-box access.
Prior signals-verbatim regurgitation and membership inference-are unreliable at
the level of individual documents or require altering the visible text. We
introduce a text-preserving watermarking framework that embeds sequences of
invisible Unicode characters into documents. Each watermark is split into a cue
(embedded in odd chunks) and a reply (embedded in even chunks). At audit time,
we submit prompts that contain only the cue; the presence of the corresponding
reply in the model's output provides evidence of memorization consistent with
training on the marked text. To obtain sound decisions, we compare the score of
the published watermark against a held-out set of counterfactual watermarks and
apply a ranking test with a provable false-positive-rate bound. The design is
(i) minimally invasive (no visible text changes), (ii) scalable to many users
and documents via a large watermark space and multi-watermark attribution, and
(iii) robust to common passive transformations. We evaluate on open-weight LLMs
and multiple text domains, analyzing regurgitation dynamics, sensitivity to
training set size, and interference under multiple concurrent watermarks. Our
results demonstrate reliable post-hoc provenance signals with bounded FPR under
black-box access. We experimentally observe a failure rate of less than 0.1\%
when detecting a reply after fine-tuning with 50 marked documents. Conversely,
no spurious reply was recovered in over 18,000 challenges, corresponding to a
100\%TPR@0\% FPR. Moreover, detection rates remain relatively stable as the
dataset size increases, maintaining a per-document detection rate above 45\%
even when the marked collection accounts for less than 0.33\% of the
fine-tuning data.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The proliferation of high-fidelity synthetic media, coupled with exploitable
hardware vulnerabilities in conventional imaging pipelines, has precipitated a
crisis of trust in digital content. Existing countermeasures, from post-hoc
classifiers to software-based signing, fail to address the fundamental
challenge of establishing an unbreakable link to reality at the moment of
capture. This whitepaper introduces Signing Right Away (SRA), a comprehensive
security architecture that guarantees the provenance of digital media from
"silicon to silicon to signed file." SRA leverages a four-pillar security
model-Confidentiality, Integrity, Authentication, and Replay Protection, akin
to the MIPI Camera Security Framework (CSF), but also extends its scope beyond
the internal data bus to the creation of a cryptographically sealed,
C2PA-compliant final asset. By securing the entire imaging pipeline within a
Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), SRA ensures that every captured image and
video carries an immutable, verifiable proof of origin. This provides a
foundational solution for industries reliant on trustworthy visual information,
including journalism, legal evidence, and insurance. We present the SRA
architecture, a detailed implementation roadmap informed by empirical
prototyping, and a comparative analysis that positions SRA as the essential
"last mile" in the chain of content trust.

maintaining deterministic output. Utility-preserving enhancements include
NaN-pattern pre-partitioning, metric-driven cut scoring, and dynamic
suppression budget management. Experiments on the 48k-record UCI ADULT dataset
and synthetically scaled versions up to 1M records achieve lower Discernibility
Metric scores than Original Mondrian for numeric quasi-identifier sets while
parallel processing delivers up to 4x speedup vs. sequential Core Mondrian.
Core Mondrian enables privacy-compliant equity analytics at production scale.

Abstract: Radio Frequency Fingerprinting (RFF) has evolved as an effective solution for
authenticating devices by leveraging the unique imperfections in hardware
components involved in the signal generation process. In this work, we propose
a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based framework for detecting rogue
devices and identifying genuine ones using softmax probability thresholding. We
emulate an attack scenario in which adversaries attempt to mimic the RF
characteristics of genuine devices by training a Generative Adversarial Network
(GAN) using In-phase and Quadrature (IQ) samples from genuine devices. The
proposed approach is verified using IQ samples collected from ten different
ADALM-PLUTO Software Defined Radios (SDRs), with seven devices considered
genuine, two as rogue, and one used for validation to determine the threshold.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Pingmark defines a universal textual protocol for expressing spatial context
through a minimal symbol: !@. Rather than embedding coordinates or using
proprietary map links, Pingmark introduces a semantic trigger that compliant
client applications interpret to generate a standardized resolver link of the
form https://pingmark.me/lat/lon/[timestamp]. This allows location expression
to function like existing textual conventions - @ for identity or # for topics
- but for physical space. The protocol requires no user registration, relies on
open mapping technologies, and protects privacy by generating location data
ephemerally and locally. This paper presents the motivation, syntax, and design
of the Pingmark Protocol Specification (PPS v0.1), its reference resolver
implementation, and the long-term goal of establishing Pingmark as an open
Internet standard for spatial mentions.

Abstract: Software-Defined Vehicles (SDVs) introduce innovative features that extend
the vehicle's lifecycle through the integration of outsourced applications and
continuous Over-The-Air (OTA) updates. This shift necessitates robust
cybersecurity and system resilience. While research on Connected and Autonomous
Vehicles (CAV) has been extensive, there is a lack of clarity in distinguishing
SDVs from non-SDVs and a need to consolidate cybersecurity research. SDVs, with
their extensive connectivity, have a broader attack surface. Besides, their
software-centric nature introduces additional vulnerabilities. This paper
provides a comprehensive examination of SDVs, detailing their ecosystem,
enabling technologies, and the principal cyberattack entry points that arise
from their architectural and operational characteristics. We also introduce a
novel, layered taxonomy that maps concrete exploit techniques onto core SDV
properties and attack paths, and use it to analyze representative studies and
experimental approaches.

transformed the field of software development. However, this advancement also
presents significant security challenges, as LLM-generated code often contains
vulnerabilities. One direction of research strengthens LLMs by injecting or
refining security knowledge through curated datasets, model tuning, or static
analyzers. While effective in certain settings, these methods can be
resource-intensive, less adaptable to zero-day vulnerabilities, and often
inapplicable to proprietary models. To address these challenges, we introduce
GRASP, which explores a new direction that focuses on structured reasoning over
Secure Coding Practices(SCPs) rather than additional training or external
feedback. GRASP comprises two key ideas: (1) an SCP graph that organizes SCPs
into a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) capturing dependencies and relationships,
and (2) a graph-based reasoning process that systematically guides LLMs through
relevant SCPs for code generation. This design enables interpretable,
model-agnostic, and scalable security improvements, particularly for previously
unseen vulnerabilities. Our evaluation shows that GRASP consistently achieves
Security Rates (SR) exceeding 80% across multiple LLMs, and delivers up to 88%
improvements over baselines on zero-day vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at tasks such as dialogue, summarization,
and question answering, yet they struggle to adapt to specialized domains and
evolving facts. To overcome this, web search has been integrated into LLMs,
allowing real-time access to online content. However, this connection magnifies
safety risks, as adversarial prompts combined with untrusted sources can cause
severe vulnerabilities. We investigate red teaming for LLMs with web search and
present CREST-Search, a framework that systematically exposes risks in such
systems. Unlike existing methods for standalone LLMs, CREST-Search addresses
the complex workflow of search-enabled models by generating adversarial queries
with in-context learning and refining them through iterative feedback. We
further construct WebSearch-Harm, a search-specific dataset to fine-tune LLMs
into efficient red-teaming agents. Experiments show that CREST-Search
effectively bypasses safety filters and reveals vulnerabilities in modern
web-augmented LLMs, underscoring the need for specialized defenses to ensure
trustworthy deployment.

Abstract: Cloud computing has become the foundation of modern digital infrastructure,
yet the absence of a unified architectural and compliance framework impedes
interoperability, auditability, and robust security. This paper introduces a
formal, machine-readable semantic model for Cloud Engines, integrating the
architectural taxonomy of ISO/IEC 22123 (Cloud Reference Architecture) with the
security and compliance controls of ISO/IEC 27001:2022 and ISO/IEC TR
3445:2022. The model decomposes cloud systems into four canonical
interfaces--Control, Business, Audit, and Data--and extends them with a
security ontology that maps mechanisms such as authentication, authorization,
and encryption to specific compliance controls. Expressed in RDF/Turtle, the
model enables semantic reasoning, automated compliance validation, and
vendor-neutral architecture design. We demonstrate its practical utility
through OpenStack and AWS case studies, and provide reproducible validation
workflows using SPARQL and SHACL. This work advances the state of cloud
security modeling by bridging architectural and compliance standards in a
unified framework, with a particular emphasis on auditability.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have garnered significant attention for their
remarkable ability to interpret and generate multimodal content. However,
securing these models against jailbreak attacks continues to be a substantial
challenge. Unlike text-only models, VLMs integrate additional modalities,
introducing novel vulnerabilities such as image hijacking, which can manipulate
the model into producing inappropriate or harmful responses. Drawing
inspiration from text-based jailbreaks like the "Do Anything Now" (DAN)
command, this work introduces VisualDAN, a single adversarial image embedded
with DAN-style commands. Specifically, we prepend harmful corpora with
affirmative prefixes (e.g., "Sure, I can provide the guidance you need") to
trick the model into responding positively to malicious queries. The
adversarial image is then trained on these DAN-inspired harmful texts and
transformed into the text domain to elicit malicious outputs. Extensive
experiments on models such as MiniGPT-4, MiniGPT-v2, InstructBLIP, and LLaVA
reveal that VisualDAN effectively bypasses the safeguards of aligned VLMs,
forcing them to execute a broad range of harmful instructions that severely
violate ethical standards. Our results further demonstrate that even a small
amount of toxic content can significantly amplify harmful outputs once the
model's defenses are compromised. These findings highlight the urgent need for
robust defenses against image-based attacks and offer critical insights for
future research into the alignment and security of VLMs.

Abstract: Smart homes are increasingly populated with heterogeneous Internet of Things
(IoT) devices that interact continuously with users and the environment. This
diversity introduces critical challenges in device identification,
authentication, and security, where fingerprinting techniques have emerged as a
key approach. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive analysis of IoT
fingerprinting specifically in the context of smart homes, examining methods
for device and their event detection, classification, and intrusion prevention.
We review existing techniques, e.g., network traffic analysis or machine
learning-based schemes, highlighting their applicability and limitations in
home environments characterized by resource-constrained devices, dynamic usage
patterns, and privacy requirements. Furthermore, we discuss fingerprinting
system deployment challenges like scalability, interoperability, and energy
efficiency, as well as emerging opportunities enabled by generative AI and
federated learning. Finally, we outline open research directions that can
advance reliable and privacy-preserving fingerprinting for next-generation
smart home ecosystems.

Abstract: The open radio access network (O-RAN) enables modular, intelligent, and
programmable 5G network architectures through the adoption of software-defined
networking, network function virtualization, and implementation of standardized
open interfaces. However, one of the security concerns for O-RAN, which can
severely undermine network performance, is jamming attacks. This paper presents
SAJD- a self-adaptive jammer detection framework that autonomously detects
jamming attacks in AI/ML framework-integrated ORAN environments without human
intervention. The SAJD framework forms a closed-loop system that includes
near-realtime inference of radio signal jamming via our developed ML-based
xApp, as well as continuous monitoring and retraining pipelines through rApps.
In this demonstration, we will show how SAJD outperforms state-of-the-art
jamming detection xApp (offline trained with manual labels) in terms of
accuracy and adaptability under various dynamic and previously unseen
interference scenarios in the O-RAN-compliant testbed.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: With the proliferation of decentralized applications (DApps), the conflict
between the transparency of blockchain technology and user data privacy has
become increasingly prominent. While Decentralized Identity (DID) and
Verifiable Credentials (VCs) provide a standardized framework for user data
sovereignty, achieving trusted identity verification and data sharing without
compromising privacy remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a
novel, comprehensive framework that integrates DIDs and VCs with efficient
Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) schemes to address this core issue. The key
contributions of this framework are threefold: first, it constructs a set of
strong privacy-preserving protocols based on zk-STARKs, allowing users to prove
that their credentials satisfy specific conditions (e.g., "age is over 18")
without revealing any underlying sensitive data. Second, it designs a scalable,
privacy-preserving credential revocation mechanism based on cryptographic
accumulators, effectively solving credential management challenges in
large-scale scenarios. Finally, it integrates a practical social key recovery
scheme, significantly enhancing system usability and security. Through a
prototype implementation and performance evaluation, this paper quantitatively
analyzes the framework's performance in terms of proof generation time,
verification overhead, and on-chain costs. Compared to existing
state-of-the-art systems based on zk-SNARKs, our framework, at the cost of a
larger proof size, significantly improves prover efficiency for complex
computations and provides stronger security guarantees, including no trusted
setup and post-quantum security. Finally, a case study in the decentralized
finance (DeFi) credit scoring scenario demonstrates the framework's immense
potential for unlocking capital efficiency and fostering a trusted data
economy.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Proof of Work (PoW) is widely regarded as the most secure permissionless
blockchain consensus protocol. However, its reliance on computationally
intensive yet externally useless puzzles results in excessive electric energy
wasting. To alleviate this, Proof of Useful Work (PoUW) has been explored as an
alternative to secure blockchain platforms while also producing real-world
value. Despite this promise, existing PoUW proposals often fail to embed the
integrity of the chain and identity of the miner into the puzzle solutions, not
meeting necessary requirements for PoW and thus rendering them vulnerable. In
this work, we propose a PoUW consensus protocol that computes client-outsourced
zk-SNARKs proofs as a byproduct, which are at the same time used to secure the
consensus protocol. We further leverage this mechanism to design a
decentralized marketplace for outsourcing zk-SNARK proof generation, which is,
to the best of our knowledge, the first such marketplace operating at the
consensus layer, while meeting all necessary properties of PoW.

Abstract: Secret-key generation and agreement based on wireless channel reciprocity
offers a promising avenue for securing IoT networks. However, existing
approaches predominantly rely on the similarity of instantaneous channel
measurement samples between communicating devices. This narrow view of
reciprocity is often impractical, as it is highly susceptible to noise,
asynchronous sampling, channel fading, and other system-level imperfections --
all of which significantly impair key generation performance. Furthermore, the
quantization step common in traditional schemes introduces irreversible errors,
further limiting efficiency. In this work, we propose a novel approach for
secret-key generation by using wavelet scattering networks to extract robust
and reciprocal CSI features. Dimensionality reduction is applied to uncover
hidden cluster structures, which are then used to build hidden Markov models
for efficient key agreement. Our approach eliminates the need for quantization
and effectively captures channel randomness. It achieves a 5x improvement in
key generation rate compared to traditional benchmarks, providing a secure and
efficient solution for key generation in resource-constrained IoT environments.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Contemporary web application architectures involve many layers of proxy
services that process traffic. Due to the complexity of HTTP and vendor design
decisions, these proxies sometimes process a given request in different ways.
Attackers can exploit these processing discrepancies to launch damaging attacks
including web cache poisoning and request smuggling. Discrepancy attacks are
surging, yet, there exists no systemic defense.
  In this work, we propose the first comprehensive defense to address this
problem, called HTTP Request Synchronization. Our scheme uses standard HTTP
extension mechanisms to augment each request with a complete processing
history. It propagates this context through the traffic path detailing how each
server hop has processed said request. Using this history, every proxy server
can validate that their processing is consistent with all previous hops,
eliminating discrepancy attacks. We implement our scheme for 5 popular proxy
technologies, Apache, NGINX, HAProxy, Varnish, and Cloudflare, demonstrating
its practical impact.

Abstract: Machine learning has become a crucial part of our lives, with applications
spanning nearly every aspect of our daily activities. However, using personal
information in machine learning applications has sparked significant security
and privacy concerns about user data. To address these challenges, different
privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML) frameworks have been developed to
protect sensitive information in machine learning applications. These
frameworks generally attempt to balance design trade-offs such as computational
efficiency, communication overhead, security guarantees, and scalability.
Despite the advancements, selecting the optimal framework and parameters for
specific deployment scenarios remains a complex and critical challenge for
privacy and security application developers.
  We present Prismo, an open-source recommendation system designed to aid in
selecting optimal parameters and frameworks for different PPML application
scenarios. Prismo enables users to explore a comprehensive space of PPML
frameworks through various properties based on user-defined objectives. It
supports automated filtering of suitable candidate frameworks by considering
parameters such as the number of parties in multi-party computation or
federated learning and computation cost constraints in homomorphic encryption.
Prismo models every use case into a Linear Integer Programming optimization
problem, ensuring tailored solutions are recommended for each scenario. We
evaluate Prismo's effectiveness through multiple use cases, demonstrating its
ability to deliver best-fit solutions in different deployment scenarios.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large vision-language model (LVLM)-based web agents are emerging as powerful
tools for automating complex online tasks. However, when deployed in real-world
environments, they face serious security risks, motivating the design of
security evaluation benchmarks. Existing benchmarks provide only partial
coverage, typically restricted to narrow scenarios such as user-level prompt
manipulation, and thus fail to capture the broad range of agent
vulnerabilities. To address this gap, we present \tool{}, the first holistic
benchmark for evaluating the security of LVLM-based web agents. \tool{} first
introduces a unified evaluation suite comprising six simulated but realistic
web environments (\eg, e-commerce platforms, community forums) and includes
2,970 high-quality trajectories spanning diverse tasks and attack settings. The
suite defines a structured taxonomy of six attack vectors spanning both
user-level and environment-level manipulations. In addition, we introduce a
multi-layered evaluation protocol that analyzes agent failures across three
critical dimensions: internal reasoning, behavioral trajectory, and task
outcome, facilitating a fine-grained risk analysis that goes far beyond simple
success metrics. Using this benchmark, we conduct large-scale experiments on 9
representative LVLMs, which fall into three categories: general-purpose,
agent-specialized, and GUI-grounded. Our results show that all tested agents
are consistently vulnerable to subtle adversarial manipulations and reveal
critical trade-offs between model specialization and security. By providing (1)
a comprehensive benchmark suite with diverse environments and a multi-layered
evaluation pipeline, and (2) empirical insights into the security challenges of
modern LVLM-based web agents, \tool{} establishes a foundation for advancing
trustworthy web agent deployment.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Harmful fine-tuning issues present significant safety challenges for
fine-tuning-as-a-service in large language models. Existing alignment-stage
defenses, e.g., Vaccine, Repnoise, Booster, and T-Vaccine, mitigate harmful
fine-tuning issues by enhancing the model's robustness during the alignment
phase. While these methods have been proposed to mitigate the issue, they often
overlook a critical upstream factor: the role of the original safety-alignment
data. We observe that their defense performance and computational efficiency
remain constrained by the quality and composition of the alignment dataset. To
address this limitation, we propose Pharmacist, a safety alignment data
curation solution that enhances defense against harmful fine-tuning by
selecting a high-quality and safety-critical core subset from the original
alignment data. The core idea of Pharmacist is to train an alignment data
selector to rank alignment data. Specifically, up-ranking high-quality and
safety-critical alignment data, down-ranking low-quality and
non-safety-critical data. Empirical results indicate that models trained on
datasets selected by Pharmacist outperform those trained on datasets selected
by existing selection methods in both defense and inference performance. In
addition, Pharmacist can be effectively integrated with mainstream
alignment-stage defense methods. For example, when applied to RepNoise and
T-Vaccine, using the dataset selected by Pharmacist instead of the full dataset
leads to improvements in defense performance by 2.60\% and 3.30\%,
respectively, and enhances inference performance by 3.50\% and 1.10\%. Notably,
it reduces training time by 56.83\% and 57.63\%, respectively. Our code is

Abstract: System passwords serve as critical credentials for user authentication and
access control when logging into operating systems or applications. Upon
entering a valid password, users pass verification to access system resources
and execute corresponding operations. In recent years, frequent password
cracking attacks targeting system passwords have posed a severe threat to
information system security. To address this challenge, in-depth research into
password cracking attack methods and defensive technologies holds significant
importance. This paper conducts systematic research on system password
security, focusing on analyzing typical password cracking methods such as brute
force attacks, dictionary attacks, and rainbow table attacks, while evaluating
the effectiveness of existing defensive measures. The experimental section
utilizes common cryptanalysis tools, such as John the Ripper and Hashcat, to
simulate brute force and dictionary attacks. Five test datasets, each generated
using Message Digest Algorithm 5 (MD5), Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit (SHA
256), and bcrypt hash functions, are analyzed. By comparing the overall
performance of different hash algorithms and password complexity strategies
against these attacks, the effectiveness of defensive measures such as salting
and slow hashing algorithms is validated. Building upon this foundation, this
paper further evaluates widely adopted defense mechanisms, including account
lockout policies, multi-factor authentication, and risk adaptive
authentication. By integrating experimental data with recent research findings,
it analyzes the strengths and limitations of each approach while proposing
feasible improvement recommendations and optimization strategies.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Unlike regular tokens derived from existing text corpora, special tokens are
artificially created to annotate structured conversations during the
fine-tuning process of Large Language Models (LLMs). Serving as metadata of
training data, these tokens play a crucial role in instructing LLMs to generate
coherent and context-aware responses. We demonstrate that special tokens can be
exploited to construct four attack primitives, with which malicious users can
reliably bypass the internal safety alignment of online LLM services and
circumvent state-of-the-art (SOTA) external content moderation systems
simultaneously. Moreover, we found that addressing this threat is challenging,
as aggressive defense mechanisms-such as input sanitization by removing special
tokens entirely, as suggested in academia-are less effective than anticipated.
This is because such defense can be evaded when the special tokens are replaced
by regular ones with high semantic similarity within the tokenizer's embedding
space. We systemically evaluated our method, named MetaBreak, on both lab
environment and commercial LLM platforms. Our approach achieves jailbreak rates
comparable to SOTA prompt-engineering-based solutions when no content
moderation is deployed. However, when there is content moderation, MetaBreak
outperforms SOTA solutions PAP and GPTFuzzer by 11.6% and 34.8%, respectively.
Finally, since MetaBreak employs a fundamentally different strategy from prompt
engineering, the two approaches can work synergistically. Notably, empowering
MetaBreak on PAP and GPTFuzzer boosts jailbreak rates by 24.3% and 20.2%,
respectively.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into computer applications
has introduced transformative capabilities but also significant security
challenges. Existing safety alignments, which primarily focus on semantic
interpretation, leave LLMs vulnerable to attacks that use non-standard data
representations. This paper introduces ArtPerception, a novel black-box
jailbreak framework that strategically leverages ASCII art to bypass the
security measures of state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs. Unlike prior methods that
rely on iterative, brute-force attacks, ArtPerception introduces a systematic,
two-phase methodology. Phase 1 conducts a one-time, model-specific pre-test to
empirically determine the optimal parameters for ASCII art recognition. Phase 2
leverages these insights to launch a highly efficient, one-shot malicious
jailbreak attack. We propose a Modified Levenshtein Distance (MLD) metric for a
more nuanced evaluation of an LLM's recognition capability. Through
comprehensive experiments on four SOTA open-source LLMs, we demonstrate
superior jailbreak performance. We further validate our framework's real-world
relevance by showing its successful transferability to leading commercial
models, including GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 3.7, and DeepSeek-V3, and by conducting
a rigorous effectiveness analysis against potential defenses such as LLaMA
Guard and Azure's content filters. Our findings underscore that true LLM
security requires defending against a multi-modal space of interpretations,
even within text-only inputs, and highlight the effectiveness of strategic,
reconnaissance-based attacks. Content Warning: This paper includes potentially
harmful and offensive model outputs.

Abstract: GraphQL's flexible query model and nested data dependencies expose APIs to
complex, context-dependent vulnerabilities that are difficult to uncover using
conventional testing tools. Existing fuzzers either rely on random payload
generation or rigid mutation heuristics, failing to adapt to the dynamic
structures of GraphQL schemas and responses. We present PrediQL, the first
retrieval-augmented, LLM-guided fuzzer for GraphQL APIs. PrediQL combines large
language model reasoning with adaptive feedback loops to generate semantically
valid and diverse queries. It models the choice of fuzzing strategy as a
multi-armed bandit problem, balancing exploration of new query structures with
exploitation of past successes. To enhance efficiency, PrediQL retrieves and
reuses execution traces, schema fragments, and prior errors, enabling
self-correction and progressive learning across test iterations. Beyond input
generation, PrediQL integrates a context-aware vulnerability detector that uses
LLM reasoning to analyze responses, interpreting data values, error messages,
and status codes to identify issues such as injection flaws, access-control
bypasses, and information disclosure. Our evaluation across open-source and
benchmark GraphQL APIs shows that PrediQL achieves significantly higher
coverage and vulnerability discovery rates compared to state-of-the-art
baselines. These results demonstrate that combining retrieval-augmented
reasoning with adaptive fuzzing can transform API security testing from
reactive enumeration to intelligent exploration.

Abstract: Post-quantum cryptography (PQC) is moving from evaluation to deployment as
NIST finalizes standards for ML-KEM, ML-DSA, and SLH-DSA. This survey maps the
space from foundations to practice. We first develop a taxonomy across
lattice-, code-, hash-, multivariate-, isogeny-, and MPC-in-the-Head families,
summarizing security assumptions, cryptanalysis, and standardization status. We
then compare performance and communication costs using representative,
implementation-grounded measurements, and review hardware acceleration (AVX2,
FPGA/ASIC) and implementation security with a focus on side-channel resistance.
Building upward, we examine protocol integration (TLS, DNSSEC), PKI and
certificate hygiene, and deployment in constrained and high-assurance
environments (IoT, cloud, finance, blockchain). We also discuss complementarity
with quantum technologies (QKD, QRNGs) and the limits of near-term quantum
computing. Throughout, we emphasize crypto-agility, hybrid migration, and
evidence-based guidance for operators. We conclude with open problems spanning
parameter agility, leakage-resilient implementations, and domain-specific
rollout playbooks. This survey aims to be a practical reference for researchers
and practitioners planning quantum-safe systems, bridging standards,
engineering, and operations.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Open-source large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated considerable
dominance over proprietary LLMs in resolving neural processing tasks, thanks to
the collaborative and sharing nature. Although full access to source codes,
model parameters, and training data lays the groundwork for transparency, we
argue that such a full-access manner is vulnerable to stego attacks, and their
ill-effects are not fully understood. In this paper, we conduct a systematic
formalization for stego attacks on open-source LLMs by enumerating all possible
threat models associated with adversary objectives, knowledge, and
capabilities. Therein, the threat posed by adversaries with internal knowledge,
who inject payloads and triggers during the model sharing phase, is of
practical interest. We go even further and propose the first stego attack on
open-source LLMs, dubbed SASER, which wields impacts through identifying
targeted parameters, embedding payloads, injecting triggers, and executing
payloads sequentially. Particularly, SASER enhances the attack robustness
against quantization-based local deployment by de-quantizing the embedded
payloads. In addition, to achieve stealthiness, SASER devises the
performance-aware importance metric to identify targeted parameters with the
least degradation of model performance. Extensive experiments on LlaMA2-7B and
ChatGLM3-6B, without quantization, show that the stealth rate of SASER
outperforms existing stego attacks (for general DNNs) by up to 98.1%, while
achieving the same attack success rate (ASR) of 100%. More importantly, SASER
improves ASR on quantized models from 0 to 100% in all settings. We appeal for
investigations on countermeasures against SASER in view of the significant

Abstract: Is module-lattice reduction better than unstructured lattice reduction? This
question was highlighted as 'Q8' in the Kyber NIST standardization submission
(Avanzi et al., 2021), as potentially affecting the concrete security of Kyber
and other module-lattice-based schemes. Foundational works on module-lattice
reduction (Lee, Pellet-Mary, Stehl\'e, and Wallet, ASIACRYPT 2019; Mukherjee
and Stephens-Davidowitz, CRYPTO 2020) confirmed the existence of such module
variants of LLL and block-reduction algorithms, but focus only on provable
worst-case asymptotic behavior.
  In this work, we present a concrete average-case analysis of module-lattice
reduction. Specifically, we address the question of the expected slope after
running module-BKZ, and pinpoint the discriminant $\Delta_K$ of the number
field at hand as the main quantity driving this slope. We convert this back
into a gain or loss on the blocksize $\beta$: module-BKZ in a number field $K$
of degree $d$ requires an SVP oracle of dimension $\beta + \log(|\Delta_K| /
d^d)\beta /(d\log \beta) + o(\beta / \log \beta)$ to reach the same slope as
unstructured BKZ with blocksize $\beta$. This asymptotic summary hides further
terms that we predict concretely using experimentally verified heuristics.
Incidentally, we provide the first open-source implementation of module-BKZ for
some cyclotomic fields.
  For power-of-two cyclotomic fields, we have $|\Delta_K| = d^d$, and conclude
that module-BKZ requires a blocksize larger than its unstructured counterpart
by $d-1+o(1)$. On the contrary, for all other cyclotomic fields we have
$|\Delta_K| < d^d$, so module-BKZ provides a sublinear $\Theta(\beta/\log
\beta)$ gain on the required blocksize, yielding a subexponential speedup of
$\exp(\Theta(\beta/\log \beta))$.

Abstract: Decentralized communication is becoming an important use case within Web3. On
Ethereum, users can repurpose the transaction input data field to embed
natural-language messages, commonly known as Input Data Messages (IDMs).
However, as IDMs gain wider adoption, there has been a growing volume of toxic
content on-chain. This trend is concerning, as Ethereum provides no
protocol-level support for content moderation.
  We propose two moderation frameworks for Ethereum IDMs: (i) BUILDERMOD, where
builders perform semantic checks during block construction; and (ii) USERMOD,
where users proactively obtain moderation proofs from external classifiers and
embed them in transactions. Our evaluation reveals that BUILDERMOD incurs high
block-time overhead, which limits its practicality. In contrast, USERMOD
enables lower-latency validation and scales more effectively, making it a more
practical approach in moderation-aware Ethereum environments.
  Our study lays the groundwork for protocol-level content governance in
decentralized systems, and we hope it contributes to the development of a
decentralized communication environment that is safe, trustworthy, and socially
responsible.

Abstract: As autonomous vehicles become an essential component of modern
transportation, they are increasingly vulnerable to threats such as GPS
spoofing attacks. This study presents an adaptive detection approach utilizing
a dynamically tuned Density Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise
(DBSCAN) algorithm, designed to adjust the detection threshold ({\epsilon}) in
real-time. The threshold is updated based on the recursive mean and standard
deviation of displacement errors between GPS and in-vehicle sensors data, but
only at instances classified as non-anomalous. Furthermore, an initial
threshold, determined from 120,000 clean data samples, ensures the capability
to identify even subtle and gradual GPS spoofing attempts from the beginning.
To assess the performance of the proposed method, five different subsets from
the real-world Honda Research Institute Driving Dataset (HDD) are selected to
simulate both large and small magnitude GPS spoofing attacks. The modified
algorithm effectively identifies turn-by-turn, stop, overshoot, and multiple
small biased spoofing attacks, achieving detection accuracies of 98.621%,
99.960.1%, 99.880.1%, and 98.380.1%, respectively. This work provides a
substantial advancement in enhancing the security and safety of AVs against GPS
spoofing threats.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Classical linear ciphers, such as the Hill cipher, operate on fixed,
finite-dimensional modules and are therefore vulnerable to straightforward
known-plaintext attacks that recover the key as a fully determined linear
operator. We propose a symmetric-key cryptosystem whose linear action takes
place instead in the Burnside ring $A(G)$ of a compact Lie group $G$, with
emphasis on the case $G=O(2)$. The secret key consists of (i) a compact Lie
group $G$; (ii) a secret total ordering of the subgroup orbit-basis of $A(G)$;
and (iii) a finite set $S$ of indices of irreducible $G$-representations, whose
associated basic degrees define an involutory multiplier $k\in A(G)$. Messages
of arbitrary finite length are encoded as finitely supported elements of $A(G)$
and encrypted via the Burnside product with $k$. For $G=O(2)$ we prove that
encryption preserves plaintext support among the generators
$\{(D_1),\dots,(D_L),(SO(2)),(O(2))\}$, avoiding ciphertext expansion and
security leakage. We then analyze security in passive models, showing that any
finite set of observations constrains the action only on a finite-rank
submodule $W_L\subset A(O(2))$, and we show information-theoretic
non-identifiability of the key from such data. Finally, we prove the scheme is
\emph{not} IND-CPA secure, by presenting a one-query chosen-plaintext
distinguisher based on dihedral probes.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: With the growing deployment of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in
real-world embodied AI systems, their increasing vulnerability to backdoor
attacks poses a serious safety threat. A backdoored VLA agent can be covertly
triggered by a pre-injected backdoor to execute adversarial actions,
potentially causing system failures or even physical harm. Although backdoor
attacks on VLA models have been explored, prior work has focused only on
untargeted attacks, leaving the more practically threatening scenario of
targeted manipulation unexamined. In this paper, we study targeted backdoor
attacks on VLA models and introduce TabVLA, a novel framework that enables such
attacks via black-box fine-tuning. TabVLA explores two deployment-relevant
inference-time threat models: input-stream editing and in-scene triggering. It
formulates poisoned data generation as an optimization problem to improve
attack effectivess. Experiments with OpenVLA-7B on the LIBERO benchmark reveal
that the vision channel is the principal attack surface: targeted backdoors
succeed with minimal poisoning, remain robust across variations in trigger
design, and are degraded only by positional mismatches between fine-tuning and
inference triggers. We also investigate a potential detection-based defense
against TabVLA, which reconstructs latent visual triggers from the input stream
to flag activation-conditioned backdoor samples. Our work highlights the
vulnerability of VLA models to targeted backdoor manipulation and underscores
the need for more advanced defenses.

Abstract: The promise of LLM watermarking rests on a core assumption that a specific
watermark proves authorship by a specific model. We demonstrate that this
assumption is dangerously flawed. We introduce the threat of watermark
spoofing, a sophisticated attack that allows a malicious model to generate text
containing the authentic-looking watermark of a trusted, victim model. This
enables the seamless misattribution of harmful content, such as disinformation,
to reputable sources. The key to our attack is repurposing watermark
radioactivity, the unintended inheritance of data patterns during fine-tuning,
from a discoverable trait into an attack vector. By distilling knowledge from a
watermarked teacher model, our framework allows an attacker to steal and
replicate the watermarking signal of the victim model. This work reveals a
critical security gap in text authorship verification and calls for a paradigm
shift towards technologies capable of distinguishing authentic watermarks from
expertly imitated ones. Our code is available at

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Text data has become extremely valuable on large language models (LLMs) and
even lead to general artificial intelligence (AGI). A lot of high-quality text
in the real world is private and cannot be freely used due to privacy concerns.
Therefore, differentially private (DP) synthetic text generation has been
proposed, aiming to produce high-utility synthetic data while protecting
sensitive information. However, existing DP synthetic text generation imposes
uniform guarantees that often overprotect non-sensitive content, resulting in
substantial utility loss and computational overhead. Therefore, we propose
Secret-Protected Evolution (SecPE), a novel framework that extends private
evolution with secret-aware protection. Theoretically, we show that SecPE
satisfies $(\mathrm{p}, \mathrm{r})$-secret protection, constituting a
relaxation of Gaussian DP that enables tighter utility-privacy trade-offs,
while also substantially reducing computational complexity relative to baseline
methods. Empirically, across the OpenReview, PubMed, and Yelp benchmarks, SecPE
consistently achieves lower Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) and higher
downstream task accuracy than GDP-based Aug-PE baselines, while requiring less
noise to attain the same level of protection. Our results highlight that
secret-aware guarantees can unlock more practical and effective
privacy-preserving synthetic text generation.

Abstract: Dynamically distributed inflation is a common mechanism used to guide a
blockchain's staking rate towards a desired equilibrium between network
security and token liquidity.
  However, the high sensitivity of the annual percentage yield to changes in
the staking rate, coupled with the inherent feedback delays in staker
responses, can induce undesirable oscillations around this equilibrium.
  This paper investigates this instability phenomenon. We analyze the dynamics
of inflation-based reward systems and propose a novel distribution model
designed to stabilize the staking rate. Our solution effectively dampens
oscillations, stabilizing the yield within a target staking range.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Local Differential Privacy (LDP) addresses significant privacy concerns in
sensitive data collection. In this work, we focus on numerical data collection
under LDP, targeting a significant gap in the literature: existing LDP
mechanisms are optimized for either a very small ($|\Omega| \in \{2, 3\}$) or
infinite output spaces. However, no generalized method for constructing an
optimal mechanism for an arbitrary output size $N$ exists. To fill this gap, we
propose the \textbf{N-output mechanism}, a generalized framework that maps
numerical data to one of $N$ discrete outputs.
  We formulate the mechanism's design as an optimization problem to minimize
estimation variance for any given $N \geq 2$ and develop both numerical and
analytical solutions. This results in a mechanism that is highly accurate and
adaptive, as its design is determined by solving an optimization problem for
any chosen $N$. Furthermore, we extend our framework and existing mechanisms to
the task of distribution estimation. Empirical evaluations show that the
N-output mechanism achieves state-of-the-art accuracy for mean, variance, and
distribution estimation with small communication costs.

Abstract: Large language models have gained widespread attention recently, but their
potential security vulnerabilities, especially privacy leakage, are also
becoming apparent. To test and evaluate for data extraction risks in LLM, we
proposed CoSPED, short for Consistent Soft Prompt targeted data Extraction and
Defense. We introduce several innovative components, including Dynamic Loss,
Additive Loss, Common Loss, and Self Consistency Decoding Strategy, and tested
to enhance the consistency of the soft prompt tuning process. Through extensive
experimentation with various combinations, we achieved an extraction rate of
65.2% at a 50-token prefix comparison. Our comparisons of CoSPED with other
reference works confirm our superior extraction rates. We evaluate CoSPED on
more scenarios, achieving Pythia model extraction rate of 51.7% and introducing
cross-model comparison. Finally, we explore defense through Rank-One Model
Editing and achieve a reduction in the extraction rate to 1.6%, which proves
that our analysis of extraction mechanisms can directly inform effective
mitigation strategies against soft prompt-based attacks.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) increases the reliability and
trustworthiness of the LLM response and reduces hallucination by eliminating
the need for model retraining. It does so by adding external data into the
LLM's context. We develop a new class of black-box attack, RAG-Pull, that
inserts hidden UTF characters into queries or external code repositories,
redirecting retrieval toward malicious code, thereby breaking the models'
safety alignment. We observe that query and code perturbations alone can shift
retrieval toward attacker-controlled snippets, while combined query-and-target
perturbations achieve near-perfect success. Once retrieved, these snippets
introduce exploitable vulnerabilities such as remote code execution and SQL
injection. RAG-Pull's minimal perturbations can alter the model's safety
alignment and increase preference towards unsafe code, therefore opening up a
new class of attacks on LLMs.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: LLM-based agents have demonstrated promising adaptability in real-world
applications. However, these agents remain vulnerable to a wide range of
attacks, such as tool poisoning and malicious instructions, that compromise
their execution flow and can lead to serious consequences like data breaches
and financial loss. Existing studies typically attempt to mitigate such
anomalies by predefining specific rules and enforcing them at runtime to
enhance safety. Yet, designing comprehensive rules is difficult, requiring
extensive manual effort and still leaving gaps that result in false negatives.
As agent systems evolve into complex software systems, we take inspiration from
software system security and propose TraceAegis, a provenance-based analysis
framework that leverages agent execution traces to detect potential anomalies.
In particular, TraceAegis constructs a hierarchical structure to abstract
stable execution units that characterize normal agent behaviors. These units
are then summarized into constrained behavioral rules that specify the
conditions necessary to complete a task. By validating execution traces against
both hierarchical and behavioral constraints, TraceAegis is able to effectively
detect abnormal behaviors. To evaluate the effectiveness of TraceAegis, we
introduce TraceAegis-Bench, a dataset covering two representative scenarios:
healthcare and corporate procurement. Each scenario includes 1,300 benign
behaviors and 300 abnormal behaviors, where the anomalies either violate the
agent's execution order or break the semantic consistency of its execution
sequence. Experimental results demonstrate that TraceAegis achieves strong
performance on TraceAegis-Bench, successfully identifying the majority of
abnormal behaviors.

Abstract: Threshold-Computation-in-the-Head (TCitH) and VOLE-in-the-Head (VOLEitH), two
recent developments of the MPC-in-the-Head (MPCitH) paradigm, have
significantly improved the performance of digital signature schemes in this
framework.
  In this note, we embed the restricted decoding problem within these
frameworks. We propose a structurally simple modeling that achieves competitive
signature sizes. Specifically, by instantiating the restricted decoding problem
with the same hardness assumption underlying CROSS, we reduce sizes by more
than a factor of two compared to the NIST submission. Moreover, we observe that
ternary full-weight decoding, closely related to the hardness assumption
underlying WAVE, is a restricted decoding problem. Using ternary full-weight
decoding, we obtain signature sizes comparable to the smallest MPCitH-based
candidates in the NIST competition.

Abstract: LLM-based multi-agent systems (MAS) demonstrate increasing integration into
next-generation applications, but their safety in backdoor attacks remains
largely underexplored. However, existing research has focused exclusively on
single-agent backdoor attacks, overlooking the novel attack surfaces introduced
by agent collaboration in MAS. To bridge this gap, we present the first
Distributed Backdoor Attack tailored to MAS. We decompose the backdoor into
multiple distributed attack primitives that are embedded within MAS tools.
These primitives remain dormant individually but collectively activate only
when agents collaborate in a specific sequence, thereby assembling the full
backdoor to execute targeted attacks such as data exfiltration. To fully assess
this threat, we introduce a benchmark for multi-role collaborative tasks and a
sandboxed framework to evaluate. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
attack achieves an attack success rate exceeding 95% without degrading
performance on benign tasks. This work exposes novel backdoor attack surfaces
that exploit agent collaboration, underscoring the need to move beyond
single-agent protection. Code and benchmark are available at

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The widespread use of large language models (LLMs) and open-source code has
raised ethical and security concerns regarding the distribution and attribution
of source code, including unauthorized redistribution, license violations, and
misuse of code for malicious purposes. Watermarking has emerged as a promising
solution for source attribution, but existing techniques rely heavily on
hand-crafted transformation rules, abstract syntax tree (AST) manipulation, or
task-specific training, limiting their scalability and generality across
languages. Moreover, their robustness against attacks remains limited. To
address these limitations, we propose CodeMark-LLM, an LLM-driven watermarking
framework that embeds watermark into source code without compromising its
semantics or readability. CodeMark-LLM consists of two core components: (i)
Semantically Consistent Embedding module that applies functionality-preserving
transformations to encode watermark bits, and (ii) Differential Comparison
Extraction module that identifies the applied transformations by comparing the
original and watermarked code. Leveraging the cross-lingual generalization
ability of LLM, CodeMark-LLM avoids language-specific engineering and training
pipelines. Extensive experiments across diverse programming languages and
attack scenarios demonstrate its robustness, effectiveness, and scalability.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Privacy models were introduced in privacy-preserving data publishing and
statistical disclosure control with the promise to end the need for costly
empirical assessment of disclosure risk. We examine how well this promise is
kept by the main privacy models. We find they may fail to provide adequate
protection guarantees because of problems in their definition or incur
unacceptable trade-offs between privacy protection and utility preservation.
Specifically, k-anonymity may not entirely exclude disclosure if enforced with
deterministic mechanisms or without constraints on the confidential values. On
the other hand, differential privacy (DP) incurs unacceptable utility loss for
small budgets and its privacy guarantee becomes meaningless for large budgets.
In the latter case, an ex post empirical assessment of disclosure risk becomes
necessary, undermining the main appeal of privacy models. Whereas the utility
preservation of DP can only be improved by relaxing its privacy guarantees, we
argue that a semantic reformulation of k-anonymity can offer more robust
privacy without losing utility with respect to traditional syntactic
k-anonymity.

Abstract: The rise of digital medical imaging, like MRI and CT, demands strong
encryption to protect patient data in telemedicine and cloud storage. Chaotic
systems are popular for image encryption due to their sensitivity and unique
characteristics, but existing methods often lack sufficient security. This
paper presents the Three-dimensional Diffusion Algorithm and Deep Learning
Image Encryption system (TDADL-IE), built on three key elements. First, we
propose an enhanced chaotic generator using an LSTM network with a 1D-Sine
Quadratic Chaotic Map (1D-SQCM) for better pseudorandom sequence generation.
Next, a new three-dimensional diffusion algorithm (TDA) is applied to encrypt
permuted images. TDADL-IE is versatile for images of any size. Experiments

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Mysterious sightings of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) over U.S. military
facilities, suburban neighborhoods, and commercial airports have intensified
scrutiny of drone activity. To increase accountability, the Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) introduced a Remote ID mandate, requiring unmanned
aircraft to broadcast their location, operator's location, and identity in
real-time. However, current standards leave authentication mechanisms
underspecified, enabling spoofing, relay, and replay attacks that can undermine
surveillance efforts and potentially disrupt UAS-to-UAS coordination in future
deployments. In this paper, we propose TBRD, a practical system for
authenticating Remote ID messages in a manner that aligns with existing
standards and UAS capabilities. TBRD leverages the TESLA protocol and mobile
device TEEs, and introduces a verification mechanism to build a lightweight,
mission-scoped authentication system that is both computationally efficient and
requires a low communication footprint. We evaluate the performance of TBRD
using both an FAA-requirements compatible proof-of-concept implementation for
performance metrics and a simulated 4-drone swarm mission scenario to
demonstrate its security guarantees under adversarial conditions. Our system
provides a 50\% reduction in authentication overhead compared to digital
signatures and a 100x reduction in computation time. Our results demonstrate
that TBRD can be integrated into current Remote ID infrastructures to provide a
scalable, standards-compliant message authentication for both regulatory and
operational use cases.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The proliferation of autonomous AI agents within enterprise environments
introduces a critical security challenge: managing access control for emergent,
novel tasks for which no predefined policies exist. This paper introduces an
advanced security framework that extends the Task-Based Access Control (TBAC)
model by using a Large Language Model (LLM) as an autonomous, risk-aware judge.
This model makes access control decisions not only based on an agent's intent
but also by explicitly considering the inherent \textbf{risk associated with
target resources} and the LLM's own \textbf{model uncertainty} in its
decision-making process. When an agent proposes a novel task, the LLM judge
synthesizes a just-in-time policy while also computing a composite risk score
for the task and an uncertainty estimate for its own reasoning. High-risk or
high-uncertainty requests trigger more stringent controls, such as requiring
human approval. This dual consideration of external risk and internal
confidence allows the model to enforce a more robust and adaptive version of
the principle of least privilege, paving the way for safer and more trustworthy

Abstract: Recent reasoning-based safety guardrails for Large Reasoning Models (LRMs),
such as deliberative alignment, have shown strong defense against jailbreak
attacks. By leveraging LRMs' reasoning ability, these guardrails help the
models to assess the safety of user inputs before generating final responses.
The powerful reasoning ability can analyze the intention of the input query and
will refuse to assist once it detects the harmful intent hidden by the
jailbreak methods. Such guardrails have shown a significant boost in defense,
such as the near-perfect refusal rates on the open-source gpt-oss series.
Unfortunately, we find that these powerful reasoning-based guardrails can be
extremely vulnerable to subtle manipulation of the input prompts, and once
hijacked, can lead to even more harmful results. Specifically, we first uncover
a surprisingly fragile aspect of these guardrails: simply adding a few template
tokens to the input prompt can successfully bypass the seemingly powerful
guardrails and lead to explicit and harmful responses. To explore further, we
introduce a bag of jailbreak methods that subvert the reasoning-based
guardrails. Our attacks span white-, gray-, and black-box settings and range
from effortless template manipulations to fully automated optimization. Along
with the potential for scalable implementation, these methods also achieve
alarmingly high attack success rates (e.g., exceeding 90% across 5 different
benchmarks on gpt-oss series on both local host models and online API
services). Evaluations across various leading open-source LRMs confirm that
these vulnerabilities are systemic, underscoring the urgent need for stronger
alignment techniques for open-sourced LRMs to prevent malicious misuse. Code is
open-sourced at https://chenxshuo.github.io/bag-of-tricks.

Abstract: The increasing autonomy of Large Language Models (LLMs) necessitates a
rigorous evaluation of their potential to aid in cyber offense. Existing
benchmarks often lack real-world complexity and are thus unable to accurately
assess LLMs' cybersecurity capabilities. To address this gap, we introduce
PACEbench, a practical AI cyber-exploitation benchmark built on the principles
of realistic vulnerability difficulty, environmental complexity, and cyber
defenses. Specifically, PACEbench comprises four scenarios spanning single,
blended, chained, and defense vulnerability exploitations. To handle these
complex challenges, we propose PACEagent, a novel agent that emulates human
penetration testers by supporting multi-phase reconnaissance, analysis, and
exploitation. Extensive experiments with seven frontier LLMs demonstrate that
current models struggle with complex cyber scenarios, and none can bypass
defenses. These findings suggest that current models do not yet pose a
generalized cyber offense threat. Nonetheless, our work provides a robust
benchmark to guide the trustworthy development of future models.
