### [1] [A Biosecurity Agent for Lifecycle LLM Biosecurity Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09615)
*Meiyin Meng,Zaixi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This study presents a Biosecurity Agent with four coordinated modes (dataset sanitization, preference alignment, run-time guardrails, automated red teaming) to address dual-use concerns of LLMs in biomedical research, showing reduced attack success while preserving utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs' expanded utility in biomedical research heightens dual-use concerns, including potential misuse for guiding toxic compound synthesis.

Method: The Biosecurity Agent comprises four modes: dataset sanitization (with three tiers on CORD-19 dataset), preference alignment (DPO with LoRA adapters), run-time guardrails (L1-L3 tiers), and automated red teaming.

Result: Dataset sanitization removal rates rise from 0.46% (L1) to 70.40% (L3); preference alignment reduces attack success rate (ASR) from 59.7% to 3.0%; run-time guardrails L2 achieves best balance (F1=0.720, precision=0.900, recall=0.600, FPR=0.067); no successful jailbreaks under automated red-teaming.

Conclusion: The biosecurity agent offers an auditable, lifecycle-aligned framework reducing attack success while preserving benign utility, providing safeguards for LLM use in scientific research and setting a precedent for agent-level security protections.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into biomedical
research workflows--from literature triage and hypothesis generation to
experimental design--yet this expanded utility also heightens dual-use
concerns, including the potential misuse for guiding toxic compound synthesis.
In response, this study shows a Biosecurity Agent that comprises four
coordinated modes across the model lifecycle: dataset sanitization, preference
alignment, run-time guardrails, and automated red teaming. For dataset
sanitization (Mode 1), evaluation is conducted on CORD-19, a COVID-19 Open
Research Dataset of coronavirus-related scholarly articles. We define three
sanitization tiers--L1 (compact, high-precision), L2 (human-curated biosafety
terms), and L3 (comprehensive union)--with removal rates rising from 0.46% to
70.40%, illustrating the safety-utility trade-off. For preference alignment
(Mode 2), DPO with LoRA adapters internalizes refusals and safe completions,
reducing end-to-end attack success rate (ASR) from 59.7% to 3.0%. At inference
(Mode 3), run-time guardrails across L1-L3 show the expected security-usability
trade-off: L2 achieves the best balance (F1 = 0.720, precision = 0.900, recall
= 0.600, FPR =0.067), while L3 offers stronger jailbreak resistance at the cost
of higher false positives. Under continuous automated red-teaming (Mode 4), no
successful jailbreaks are observed under the tested protocol. Taken together,
our biosecurity agent offers an auditable, lifecycle-aligned framework that
reduces attack success while preserving benign utility, providing safeguards
for the use of LLMs in scientific research and setting a precedent for future
agent-level security protections.

### [2] [Causal Digital Twins for Cyber-Physical Security: A Framework for Robust Anomaly Detection in Industrial Control Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09616)
*Mohammadhossein Homaei,Mehran Tarif,Mar Avilla,Andres Caro*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper proposes a Causal Digital Twin (CDT) framework combining causal inference and digital twin modeling for cyber-physical security in medium-scale ICS, addressing limitations of current correlation-based anomaly detection methods with improved performance on three industrial datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current anomaly detection methods for Industrial Control Systems (ICS) rely on correlation-based analysis, which cannot separate true causal relationships from spurious associations, leading to high false alarm rates and poor root cause analysis.

Method: The proposed Causal Digital Twin (CDT) framework combines causal inference theory with digital twin modeling, enabling three types of causal reasoning: association for pattern detection, intervention for understanding system responses, and counterfactual analysis for attack prevention planning.

Result: Evaluation on SWaT, WADI, and HAI datasets shows F1-scores of 0.944±0.014, 0.902±0.021, and 0.923±0.018 respectively (statistical significance p<0.0024, Bonferroni corrected), 74% reduction in false positives, 78.4% root cause analysis accuracy (vs. 48.7% for existing methods), 73.2% reduction in attack success via counterfactual analysis, and real-time performance with 3.2ms latency.

Conclusion: The CDT framework significantly improves cyber-physical security in medium-scale ICS by outperforming baseline methods in detection, false positive reduction, root cause analysis, and attack prevention, while maintaining real-time deployability and interpretability.

Abstract: Industrial Control Systems (ICS) face growing cyber-physical attacks that
exploit both network vulnerabilities and physical processes. Current anomaly
detection methods rely on correlation-based analysis, which cannot separate
true causal relationships from spurious associations. This limitation results
in high false alarm rates and poor root cause analysis. We propose a novel
Causal Digital Twin (CDT) framework for cyber-physical security in medium-scale
ICS. Our method combines causal inference theory with digital twin modeling.
The framework enables three types of causal reasoning: association for pattern
detection, intervention for understanding system responses, and counterfactual
analysis for attack prevention planning. We evaluate our framework on three
industrial datasets: SWaT, WADI, and HAI, with validation through physical
constraint compliance (90.8\%) and synthetic ground truth testing (structural
Hamming distance 0.13). Results show significant improvements over seven
baseline methods. Our CDT achieves F1-scores are $0.944 \pm 0.014$ for SWaT,
$0.902 \pm 0.021$ for WADI, and $0.923 \pm 0.018$ for HAI with statistical
significance ($p < 0.0024$, Bonferroni corrected). The framework reduces false
positives by \SI{74}{\percent} and achieves \SI{78.4}{\percent} root cause
analysis accuracy compared to \SI{48.7}{\percent} for existing methods.
Counterfactual analysis enables defense strategies that reduce attack success
by \SI{73.2}{\percent}. The system keeps real-time performance with
\SI{3.2}{ms} latency, which is suitable for industrial deployment, while
providing interpretable explanations for operators.

### [5] [Risk-Calibrated Bayesian Streaming Intrusion Detection with SRE-Aligned Decisions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09619)
*Michel Youssef*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: A risk-calibrated streaming intrusion detection approach combining BOCPD with SRE error budget-aligned decision thresholds is presented, showing improved precision-recall and probability calibration over baselines on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address distribution shift and concept drift in streaming intrusion detection while aligning decisions with SRE error budgets to optimize operational costs.

Method: Couples Bayesian Online Changepoint Detection (BOCPD) with decision thresholds based on SRE error budgets, detailing hazard model, conjugate updates, and O(1)-per-event implementation.

Result: Improved precision-recall at mid to high recall and better probability calibration compared to unsupervised baselines (ECOD, COPOD, LOF) on UNSW-NB15 and CIC-IDS2017 benchmarks, with metrics including PR-AUC, ROC-AUC, Brier score, etc.

Conclusion: The risk-calibrated approach effectively handles streaming intrusion detection challenges, outperforming baselines in key metrics and aligning with operational cost considerations via SRE error budgets.

Abstract: We present a risk-calibrated approach to streaming intrusion detection that
couples Bayesian Online Changepoint Detection (BOCPD) with decision thresholds
aligned to Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) error budgets. BOCPD provides
run-length posteriors that adapt to distribution shift and concept drift; we
map these posteriors to alert decisions by optimizing expected operational cost
under false-positive and false-negative budgets. We detail the hazard model,
conjugate updates, and an O(1)-per-event implementation. A concrete SRE example
shows how a 99.9% availability SLO (43.2 minutes per month error budget) yields
a probability threshold near 0.91 when missed incidents are 10x more costly
than false alarms. We evaluate on the full UNSW-NB15 and CIC-IDS2017 benchmarks
with chronological splits, comparing against strong unsupervised baselines
(ECOD, COPOD, and LOF). Metrics include PR-AUC, ROC-AUC, Brier score,
calibration reliability diagrams, and detection latency measured in events.
Results indicate improved precision-recall at mid to high recall and better
probability calibration relative to baselines. We release implementation
details, hyperparameters, and ablations for hazard sensitivity and
computational footprint. Code and reproducibility materials will be made
available upon publication; datasets and implementation are available from the
corresponding author upon reasonable request.

### [6] [Toward a Unified Security Framework for AI Agents: Trust, Risk, and Liability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09620)
*Jiayun Mo,Xin Kang,Tieyan Li,Zhongding Lei*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper proposes the Trust, Risk and Liability (TRL) framework to address interconnected trust, risk, and liability issues in AI agents by tying their interdependent relationships, applicable to various scenarios and expected to promote trustworthy, risk-free, and responsible AI usage in 6G networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current solutions for AI agent issues (trust, risk, liability) target each problem separately without acknowledging their inter-influential nature.

Method: The proposed TRL framework ties together the interdependent relationships of trust, risk, and liability to provide a systematic method of building/enhancing trust, analyzing/mitigating risks, and allocating/attributing liabilities, applicable to any AI agent application scenarios.

Result: The TRL framework can analyze AI agent application scenarios and suggest context-fitting measures, with implications in societal, economic, ethical impacts, etc.

Conclusion: The TRL framework is expected to bring remarkable values to addressing potential challenges and promoting trustworthy, risk-free, and responsible usage of AI in 6G networks.

Abstract: The excitement brought by the development of AI agents came alongside arising
problems. These concerns centered around users' trust issues towards AIs, the
risks involved, and the difficulty of attributing responsibilities and
liabilities. Current solutions only attempt to target each problem separately
without acknowledging their inter-influential nature. The Trust, Risk and
Liability (TRL) framework proposed in this paper, however, ties together the
interdependent relationships of trust, risk, and liability to provide a
systematic method of building and enhancing trust, analyzing and mitigating
risks, and allocating and attributing liabilities. It can be applied to analyze
any application scenarios of AI agents and suggest appropriate measures fitting
to the context. The implications of the TRL framework lie in its potential
societal impacts, economic impacts, ethical impacts, and more. It is expected
to bring remarkable values to addressing potential challenges and promoting
trustworthy, risk-free, and responsible usage of AI in 6G networks.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This survey reviews Metaverse enabling technologies and analyzes key vulnerabilities/threats, using a systematic literature review to identify vulnerabilities and countermeasures, highlighting advancements, gaps, and future directions for a secure, resilient, and ethically governed Metaverse.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a comprehensive review of Metaverse enabling technologies and a thorough analysis of key vulnerabilities and threats compromising its sustainability and user safety as it evolves.

Method: A systematic literature review (SLR) is performed to identify key vulnerabilities and their countermeasures in Metaverse platforms.

Result: Metaverse has a larger attack surface than conventional digital platforms; its immersive, decentralized, and permanent characteristics generate new vulnerabilities, and most countermeasures are theoretical or untested in real-world environments.

Conclusion: The review highlights current advancements, identifies research gaps, and outlines future directions to ensure a secure, resilient, and ethically governed Metaverse.

Abstract: The Metaverse utilizes emerging technologies such as Extended Reality (XR),
Artificial Intelligence (AI), blockchain, and digital twins to provide an
immersive and interactive virtual experience. As Metaverse continues to evolve,
it bring a range of security and privacy threats, such as identity management,
data governance, and user interactions. This survey aims to provide a
comprehensive review of the enabling technologies for the Metaverse. It also
aims to provide a thorough analysis of key vulnerabilities and threats that may
compromise its sustainability and user safety. We perform a systematic
literature review (SLR) to identify key vulnerabilities and their
countermeasures in Metaverse platforms. Metaverse offers a much larger attack
surface compared to conventional digital platforms. Immersive, decentralized,
and permanent characteristics of the Metaverse generate new vulnerabilities.
Although there are many countermeasures to these vulnerabilities, most of them
are theoretical or have not been tested in real-world environments. Our review
highlights current advancements, identifies research gaps, and outlines future
directions to ensure a secure, resilient, and ethically governed Metaverse.

### [8] [A Survey of Transaction Tracing Techniques for Blockchain Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09624)
*Ayush Kumar,Vrizlynn L. L. Thing*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper systematically reviews, categorizes, and compares blockchain transaction tracing techniques, identifies existing limitations, and suggests future research directions, focusing on cross-ledger tracking amid criminal misuse concerns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need to track cryptocurrency/assets across ledgers, especially as criminals use cross-ledger trades to obscure coin/asset flows.

Method: Performing a systematic review of tracing techniques in literature, categorizing them by criteria like tracing approach and targeted objective, and comparing them.

Result: Provided insights on the state of blockchain transaction tracing literature and identified limitations of existing approaches.

Conclusion: Suggested directions for future research in blockchain transaction tracing based on the analysis.

Abstract: With the proliferation of new blockchain-based cryptocurrencies/assets and
platforms that make it possible to transact across them, it becomes important
to consider not just whether the transfer of coins/assets can be tracked within
their respective transaction ledger, but also if they can be tracked as they
move across ledgers. This is especially important given that there are
documented cases of criminals attempting to use these cross-ledger trades to
obscure the flow of their coins/assets. In this paper, we perform a systematic
review of the various tracing techniques for blockchain transactions proposed
in literature, categorize them using multiple criteria (such as tracing
approach and targeted objective) and compare them. Based on the above
categorization, we provide insights on the state of blockchain transaction
tracing literature and identify the limitations of existing approaches.
Finally, we suggest directions for future research in this area based on our
analysis.

*Aminu Muhammad Auwal*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This study investigates vulnerabilities in Nigerian healthcare mIoT devices via MITM attack simulation and evaluates lightweight AES-128 encryption, finding it effective, low-cost, and with modest performance costs, while highlighting the need for security awareness and guidelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unsecured wireless communication in medical IoT (mIoT) devices in Nigerian healthcare exposes patient data to cyber threats, despite the potential benefits of IoT in remote monitoring and data-driven care.

Method: A prototype mIoT device with NodeMCU ESP8266 and sensors was built; unencrypted data transmissions were intercepted/altered via MITM attack simulation using Bettercap and Wireshark in controlled lab conditions, then AES-128 encryption was applied and evaluated, with performance costs and a survey of healthcare professionals also conducted.

Result: After applying AES-128 encryption, all transmissions became unreadable, tamper attempts failed; latency increased by 56.25% (80ms to 125ms), CPU use by 50% (30% to 45%), system stability remained intact, device cost under 18,000 NGN (~12 USD); survey showed moderate risk awareness, strong support for encryption/training, and barriers of limited budgets/technical complexity.

Conclusion: Lightweight AES-128 encryption provides practical, low-cost protection against common attack vectors while maintaining operational efficiency; improving security awareness and establishing clinical deployment guidelines are urgent based on professional feedback.

Abstract: The growing use of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies in Nigerian
healthcare offers potential improvements in remote monitoring and data-driven
care, but unsecured wireless communication in medical IoT (mIoT) devices
exposes patient data to cyber threats. This study investigates such
vulnerabilities through a real-time Man in the Middle (MITM) attack simulation
and evaluates lightweight AES-128 encryption on low-cost devices.
  A prototype mIoT device was built with a NodeMCU ESP8266 and sensors for
heart rate and temperature. In controlled lab conditions simulating local
healthcare networks, unencrypted data transmissions were intercepted and
altered using common tools (Bettercap, Wireshark). After AES-128 encryption was
applied, all transmissions became unreadable and tamper attempts failed,
demonstrating its effectiveness.
  Performance costs were modest, latency rose from 80 ms to 125 ms (56.25
percent increase) and CPU use from 30 percent to 45 percent, but system
stability remained intact. Device cost stayed under 18,000 NGN (about 12 USD),
making it feasible for Nigeria's resource constrained facilities.
  A survey of healthcare professionals showed moderate awareness of IoT-related
risks but strong support for encryption and staff training. Barriers included
limited budgets and technical complexity.
  The study concludes that lightweight AES-128 encryption provides practical,
low-cost protection against common attack vectors while maintaining operational
efficiency. Feedback from professionals highlights the urgency of improving
security awareness and establishing guidelines for clinical deployment.

### [10] [Hound: Relation-First Knowledge Graphs for Complex-System Reasoning in Security Audits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09633)
*Bernhard Mueller*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Hound is a relation-first graph engine that enhances system-level reasoning in complex codebases via analyst-defined views, exact retrieval, a persistent belief system, and hypothesis-centric loops, outperforming a baseline LLM analyzer on ScaBench subset with improved recall and F1.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve system-level reasoning across interrelated components in complex codebases, addressing limitations of baseline LLM analyzers in handling such reasoning.

Method: Uses flexible, analyst-defined views with compact annotations for exact retrieval, a persistent belief system with confidence-updated vulnerability hypotheses, coverage-versus-intuition planning, and a QA finalizer to confirm/reject hypotheses.

Result: On a five-project subset of ScaBench, Hound improved micro recall (31.2% vs. 8.3%) and F1 (14.2% vs. 9.8%) over a baseline LLM analyzer with modest precision trade-off.

Conclusion: The gains are attributed to flexible, relation-first graphs extending model understanding beyond call/dataflow to abstract aspects and the hypothesis-centric loop; code and artifacts are released for reproduction.

Abstract: Hound introduces a relation-first graph engine that improves system-level
reasoning across interrelated components in complex codebases. The agent
designs flexible, analyst-defined views with compact annotations (e.g.,
monetary/value flows, authentication/authorization roles, call graphs, protocol
invariants) and uses them to anchor exact retrieval: for any question, it loads
precisely the code that matters (often across components) so it can zoom out to
system structure and zoom in to the decisive lines. A second contribution is a
persistent belief system: long-lived vulnerability hypotheses whose confidence
is updated as evidence accrues. The agent employs coverage-versus-intuition
planning and a QA finalizer to confirm or reject hypotheses. On a five-project
subset of ScaBench[1], Hound improves recall and F1 over a baseline LLM
analyzer (micro recall 31.2% vs. 8.3%; F1 14.2% vs. 9.8%) with a modest
precision trade-off. We attribute these gains to flexible, relation-first
graphs that extend model understanding beyond call/dataflow to abstract
aspects, plus the hypothesis-centric loop; code and artifacts are released to
support reproduction.

### [11] [A Method for Quantifying Human Risk and a Blueprint for LLM Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09635)
*Giuseppe Canale*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper presents the Cybersecurity Psychology Framework (CPF), a novel methodology integrating psychological constructs with security telemetry to quantify human-centric vulnerabilities in security operations, addressing the gap of end-to-end operationalization of psychological vulnerabilities through measurable algorithms, a privacy-preserving LLM architecture, and mixed-methods validation, with a proof-of-concept achieving 0.92 F1-score on synthetic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research has studied individual human factors (alert fatigue, compliance fatigue, cognitive overload, risk perception biases) in isolation, but no framework provides end-to-end operationalization across the full spectrum of psychological vulnerabilities in security operations.

Method: The CPF is developed by: (1) defining measurable algorithms to quantify key psychological states using standard SOC tooling (SIEM, ticketing systems, communication platforms); (2) proposing a lightweight, privacy-preserving LLM architecture based on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and domain-specific fine-tuning to analyze structured and unstructured data for latent psychological risks; (3) detailing a rigorous mixed-methods validation strategy acknowledging the difficulty of obtaining sensitive cybersecurity data.

Result: The implementation of CPF indicators in a proof-of-concept deployment using small language models achieved a 0.92 F1-score on synthetic data.

Conclusion: This work provides the theoretical and methodological foundation necessary for industry partnerships to conduct empirical validation with real operational data.

Abstract: This paper presents the Cybersecurity Psychology Framework (CPF), a novel
methodology for quantifying human-centric vulnerabilities in security
operations through systematic integration of established psychological
constructs with operational security telemetry. While individual human
factors-alert fatigue, compliance fatigue, cognitive overload, and risk
perception biases-have been extensively studied in isolation, no framework
provides end-to-end operationalization across the full spectrum of
psychological vulnerabilities. We address this gap by: (1) defining specific,
measurable algorithms that quantify key psychological states using standard SOC
tooling (SIEM, ticketing systems, communication platforms); (2) proposing a
lightweight, privacy-preserving LLM architecture based on Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) and domain-specific fine-tuning to analyze structured and
unstructured data for latent psychological risks; (3) detailing a rigorous
mixed-methods validation strategy acknowledging the inherent difficulty of
obtaining sensitive cybersecurity data. Our implementation of CPF indicators
has been demonstrated in a proof-of-concept deployment using small language
models achieving 0.92 F1-score on synthetic data. This work provides the
theoretical and methodological foundation necessary for industry partnerships
to conduct empirical validation with real operational data.

*Tonmoy Ghosh*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper proposes a multifaceted password security framework integrating diverse attributes (e.g., Password Dissection Mechanism, human behavior, device/network/geographical context) and learning-based models to enhance protection and usability by constructing user profiles and involving users in adaptive policy-setting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to address poor user compliance and heightened vulnerability due to complex password security practices that alienate users, leaving individuals exposed through weak or improperly managed passwords.

Method: A multifaceted solution integrating diverse attributes (Password Dissection Mechanism, Dynamic Password Policy Mechanism, human behavioral patterns, device characteristics, network parameters, geographical context, etc.) and leveraging learning-based models to construct detailed user profiles.

Result: The framework enhances the usability-security paradigm by offering stronger protection than existing standards and engages users in policy-setting via an adaptive approach, capable of recognizing individuals and preventing nearly all unauthorized access or device possession.

Conclusion: The proposed multifaceted framework effectively addresses password-related risks and threats by revolutionizing password security through integration of diverse factors and learning-based models, balancing security and usability.

Abstract: Password security has been compelled to evolve in response to the growing
computational capabilities of modern systems. However, this evolution has often
resulted in increasingly complex security practices that alienate users,
leading to poor compliance and heightened vulnerability. Consequently,
individuals remain exposed to attackers through weak or improperly managed
passwords, underscoring the urgent need for a comprehensive defense mechanism
that effectively addresses password-related risks and threats. In this paper,
we propose a multifaceted solution designed to revolutionize password security
by integrating diverse attributes such as the Password Dissection Mechanism,
Dynamic Password Policy Mechanism, human behavioral patterns, device
characteristics, network parameters, geographical context, and other relevant
factors. By leveraging learning-based models, our framework constructs detailed
user profiles capable of recognizing individuals and preventing nearly all
forms of unauthorized access or device possession. The proposed framework
enhances the usability-security paradigm by offering stronger protection than
existing standards while simultaneously engaging users in the policy-setting
process through a novel, adaptive approach.

### [13] [Rounding-Guided Backdoor Injection in Deep Learning Model Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09647)
*Xiangxiang Chen,Peixin Zhang,Jun Sun,Wenhai Wang,Jingyi Wang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper presents QuRA, a novel backdoor attack exploiting model quantization by selecting critical weights and optimizing their rounding direction to embed malicious behaviors with high success rates and negligible performance degradation, bypassing existing defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Model quantization, though popular for deploying deep learning models on resource-constrained environments, may introduce overlooked security risks, which this work aims to address by exploring backdoor attacks via quantization operations.

Method: QuRA uses a novel weight selection strategy to identify critical weights influencing the backdoor target (preserving overall performance) and optimizes their rounding direction to amplify the backdoor effect across layers without degrading accuracy.

Result: Extensive experiments show QuRA achieves nearly 100% attack success rates in most cases with negligible performance degradation and can adapt to bypass existing backdoor defenses.

Conclusion: The findings highlight a critical vulnerability in widely used model quantization processes, emphasizing the need for more robust security measures.

Abstract: Model quantization is a popular technique for deploying deep learning models
on resource-constrained environments. However, it may also introduce previously
overlooked security risks. In this work, we present QuRA, a novel backdoor
attack that exploits model quantization to embed malicious behaviors. Unlike
conventional backdoor attacks relying on training data poisoning or model
training manipulation, QuRA solely works using the quantization operations. In
particular, QuRA first employs a novel weight selection strategy to identify
critical weights that influence the backdoor target (with the goal of
perserving the model's overall performance in mind). Then, by optimizing the
rounding direction of these weights, we amplify the backdoor effect across
model layers without degrading accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
QuRA achieves nearly 100% attack success rates in most cases, with negligible
performance degradation. Furthermore, we show that QuRA can adapt to bypass
existing backdoor defenses, underscoring its threat potential. Our findings
highlight critical vulnerability in widely used model quantization process,
emphasizing the need for more robust security measures. Our implementation is
available at https://github.com/cxx122/QuRA.

### [15] [Data Provenance Auditing of Fine-Tuned Large Language Models with a Text-Preserving Technique](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09655)
*Yanming Li,Seifeddine Ghozzi,Cédric Eichler,Nicolas Anciaux,Alexandra Bensamoun,Lorena Gonzalez Manzano*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a text-preserving watermarking framework using invisible Unicode characters to audit if sensitive/copyrighted texts were used to fine-tune black-box LLMs, with reliable detection, bounded false-positive rate, and robustness to transformations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods (verbatim regurgitation, membership inference) are unreliable for individual documents or require visible text changes when auditing sensitive/copyrighted text use in black-box LLM fine-tuning.

Method: A text-preserving watermarking framework embedding invisible Unicode sequences split into cue (odd chunks) and reply (even chunks); at audit, prompts with cues check for replies, using a ranking test against counterfactual watermarks for bounded false-positive rate.

Result: Reliable post-hoc provenance signals with bounded FPR under black-box access: <0.1% failure rate detecting replies with 50 marked docs, 100% TPR@0% FPR over 18,000 challenges, >45% per-document detection rate when marked docs <0.33% of fine-tuning data.

Conclusion: The framework is minimally invasive, scalable, robust, and demonstrates reliable detection of marked text use in LLM fine-tuning under black-box access with strong performance metrics.

Abstract: We address the problem of auditing whether sensitive or copyrighted texts
were used to fine-tune large language models (LLMs) under black-box access.
Prior signals-verbatim regurgitation and membership inference-are unreliable at
the level of individual documents or require altering the visible text. We
introduce a text-preserving watermarking framework that embeds sequences of
invisible Unicode characters into documents. Each watermark is split into a cue
(embedded in odd chunks) and a reply (embedded in even chunks). At audit time,
we submit prompts that contain only the cue; the presence of the corresponding
reply in the model's output provides evidence of memorization consistent with
training on the marked text. To obtain sound decisions, we compare the score of
the published watermark against a held-out set of counterfactual watermarks and
apply a ranking test with a provable false-positive-rate bound. The design is
(i) minimally invasive (no visible text changes), (ii) scalable to many users
and documents via a large watermark space and multi-watermark attribution, and
(iii) robust to common passive transformations. We evaluate on open-weight LLMs
and multiple text domains, analyzing regurgitation dynamics, sensitivity to
training set size, and interference under multiple concurrent watermarks. Our
results demonstrate reliable post-hoc provenance signals with bounded FPR under
black-box access. We experimentally observe a failure rate of less than 0.1\%
when detecting a reply after fine-tuning with 50 marked documents. Conversely,
no spurious reply was recovered in over 18,000 challenges, corresponding to a
100\%TPR@0\% FPR. Moreover, detection rates remain relatively stable as the
dataset size increases, maintaining a per-document detection rate above 45\%
even when the marked collection accounts for less than 0.33\% of the
fine-tuning data.

*Kalin Dimitrov*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Pingmark defines a universal textual protocol using !@ to express spatial context, generating resolver links without user registration, relying on open mapping, and aiming to be an open Internet standard.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a universal textual protocol for expressing spatial context similar to existing conventions like @ for identity or # for topics, without embedding coordinates or using proprietary map links.

Method: Introduces a semantic trigger !@ that compliant clients interpret to generate standardized resolver links (https://pingmark.me/lat/lon/[timestamp]), using open mapping technologies, no user registration, and local/ephemeral location data generation for privacy.

Result: Presents the Pingmark Protocol Specification (PPS v0.1), reference resolver implementation, and long-term goal of establishing it as an open Internet standard for spatial mentions.

Conclusion: Pingmark provides a privacy-protecting, open, and user-friendly textual protocol for spatial context expression, with potential to become a standard.

Abstract: Pingmark defines a universal textual protocol for expressing spatial context
through a minimal symbol: !@. Rather than embedding coordinates or using
proprietary map links, Pingmark introduces a semantic trigger that compliant
client applications interpret to generate a standardized resolver link of the
form https://pingmark.me/lat/lon/[timestamp]. This allows location expression
to function like existing textual conventions - @ for identity or # for topics
- but for physical space. The protocol requires no user registration, relies on
open mapping technologies, and protects privacy by generating location data
ephemerally and locally. This paper presents the motivation, syntax, and design
of the Pingmark Protocol Specification (PPS v0.1), its reference resolver
implementation, and the long-term goal of establishing Pingmark as an open
Internet standard for spatial mentions.

### [17] [Signing Right Away](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09656)
*Yejun Jang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This whitepaper introduces Signing Right Away (SRA), a security architecture ensuring digital media provenance from capture to signed file via a four-pillar model and Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), addressing trust issues in synthetic media and hardware vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the crisis of trust in digital content caused by high-fidelity synthetic media and exploitable hardware vulnerabilities in conventional imaging pipelines, as existing countermeasures fail to establish an unbreakable link to reality at capture.

Method: SRA leverages a four-pillar security model (Confidentiality, Integrity, Authentication, Replay Protection) akin to MIPI CSF, extends beyond internal data bus to create a cryptographically sealed, C2PA-compliant final asset, and secures the entire imaging pipeline within a TEE.

Result: SRA ensures every captured image/video carries immutable, verifiable proof of origin, providing a foundational solution for industries reliant on trustworthy visual info (journalism, legal evidence, insurance).

Conclusion: SRA is presented as the essential 'last mile' in content trust, with architecture, implementation roadmap from empirical prototyping, and comparative analysis positioning it as a key solution.

Abstract: The proliferation of high-fidelity synthetic media, coupled with exploitable
hardware vulnerabilities in conventional imaging pipelines, has precipitated a
crisis of trust in digital content. Existing countermeasures, from post-hoc
classifiers to software-based signing, fail to address the fundamental
challenge of establishing an unbreakable link to reality at the moment of
capture. This whitepaper introduces Signing Right Away (SRA), a comprehensive
security architecture that guarantees the provenance of digital media from
"silicon to silicon to signed file." SRA leverages a four-pillar security
model-Confidentiality, Integrity, Authentication, and Replay Protection, akin
to the MIPI Camera Security Framework (CSF), but also extends its scope beyond
the internal data bus to the creation of a cryptographically sealed,
C2PA-compliant final asset. By securing the entire imaging pipeline within a
Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), SRA ensures that every captured image and
video carries an immutable, verifiable proof of origin. This provides a
foundational solution for industries reliant on trustworthy visual information,
including journalism, legal evidence, and insurance. We present the SRA
architecture, a detailed implementation roadmap informed by empirical
prototyping, and a comparative analysis that positions SRA as the essential
"last mile" in the chain of content trust.

### [18] [A Scalable, Privacy-Preserving Decentralized Identity and Verifiable Data Sharing Framework based on Zero-Knowledge Proofs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09715)
*Hui Yuan*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework integrating DIDs, VCs, and ZKP (zk-STARKs) to address blockchain transparency-privacy conflict, with privacy-preserving protocols, scalable revocation via accumulators, social key recovery, and shows improved prover efficiency/security vs zk-SNARKs, demonstrated in DeFi credit scoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The conflict between blockchain transparency and user data privacy in DApps is prominent; DID/VCs lack trusted, privacy-preserving identity verification and data sharing.

Method: A framework integrating DIDs, VCs with zk-STARKs for privacy-preserving protocols, cryptographic accumulators for scalable revocation, and social key recovery.

Result: Prototype evaluation shows improved prover efficiency for complex computations, stronger security (no trusted setup, post-quantum), larger proof size vs zk-SNARKs; DeFi case study demonstrates potential for capital efficiency and trusted data economy.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses privacy-identity challenges in DApps, offering enhanced efficiency, security, and usability, with significant potential in DeFi and beyond.

Abstract: With the proliferation of decentralized applications (DApps), the conflict
between the transparency of blockchain technology and user data privacy has
become increasingly prominent. While Decentralized Identity (DID) and
Verifiable Credentials (VCs) provide a standardized framework for user data
sovereignty, achieving trusted identity verification and data sharing without
compromising privacy remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a
novel, comprehensive framework that integrates DIDs and VCs with efficient
Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) schemes to address this core issue. The key
contributions of this framework are threefold: first, it constructs a set of
strong privacy-preserving protocols based on zk-STARKs, allowing users to prove
that their credentials satisfy specific conditions (e.g., "age is over 18")
without revealing any underlying sensitive data. Second, it designs a scalable,
privacy-preserving credential revocation mechanism based on cryptographic
accumulators, effectively solving credential management challenges in
large-scale scenarios. Finally, it integrates a practical social key recovery
scheme, significantly enhancing system usability and security. Through a
prototype implementation and performance evaluation, this paper quantitatively
analyzes the framework's performance in terms of proof generation time,
verification overhead, and on-chain costs. Compared to existing
state-of-the-art systems based on zk-SNARKs, our framework, at the cost of a
larger proof size, significantly improves prover efficiency for complex
computations and provides stronger security guarantees, including no trusted
setup and post-quantum security. Finally, a case study in the decentralized
finance (DeFi) credit scoring scenario demonstrates the framework's immense
potential for unlocking capital efficiency and fostering a trusted data
economy.

Abstract: We present Core Mondrian, a scalable extension of the Original Mondrian
partition-based anonymization algorithm. A modular strategy layer supports
k-anonymity, allowing new privacy models to be added easily. A hybrid
recursive/queue execution engine exploits multi-core parallelism while
maintaining deterministic output. Utility-preserving enhancements include
NaN-pattern pre-partitioning, metric-driven cut scoring, and dynamic
suppression budget management. Experiments on the 48k-record UCI ADULT dataset
and synthetically scaled versions up to 1M records achieve lower Discernibility
Metric scores than Original Mondrian for numeric quasi-identifier sets while

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper proposes a CNN-based framework for RFF authentication, using softmax probability thresholding to detect rogue devices, verified with IQ samples from 10 ADALM-PLUTO SDRs (7 genuine, 2 rogue, 1 for threshold validation), and emulates attacks via GAN mimicking genuine RF characteristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To authenticate devices by leveraging unique hardware imperfections in signal generation (RFF), addressing the need to detect rogue devices that mimic genuine RF characteristics.

Method: A CNN-based framework with softmax probability thresholding; emulates attacks using GAN trained on genuine device IQ samples to mimic RF characteristics.

Result: The proposed approach is verified using IQ samples from ten ADALM-PLUTO SDRs (seven genuine, two rogue, one for threshold validation).

Conclusion: The CNN-based framework with softmax thresholding effectively detects rogue devices and identifies genuine ones in the emulated attack scenario.

Abstract: Radio Frequency Fingerprinting (RFF) has evolved as an effective solution for
authenticating devices by leveraging the unique imperfections in hardware
components involved in the signal generation process. In this work, we propose
a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based framework for detecting rogue
devices and identifying genuine ones using softmax probability thresholding. We
emulate an attack scenario in which adversaries attempt to mimic the RF
characteristics of genuine devices by training a Generative Adversarial Network
(GAN) using In-phase and Quadrature (IQ) samples from genuine devices. The
proposed approach is verified using IQ samples collected from ten different
ADALM-PLUTO Software Defined Radios (SDRs), with seven devices considered
genuine, two as rogue, and one used for validation to determine the threshold.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SDVs require robust cybersecurity and system resilience due to their extensive connectivity and software-centric nature, but there is a lack of clarity in distinguishing SDVs from non-SDVs and a need to consolidate cybersecurity research.

Method: The paper provides a comprehensive examination of SDVs, detailing their ecosystem, enabling technologies, and principal cyberattack entry points, and introduces a novel layered taxonomy mapping concrete exploit techniques onto core SDV properties and attack paths, using it to analyze representative studies and experimental approaches.

Result: A comprehensive examination of SDVs and a novel layered taxonomy that maps concrete exploit techniques onto core SDV properties and attack paths are presented, which is used to analyze representative studies and experimental approaches.

Conclusion: The paper offers a detailed understanding of SDVs' ecosystem, enabling technologies, cyberattack entry points, and a useful taxonomy for analyzing SDV cybersecurity research.

Abstract: Software-Defined Vehicles (SDVs) introduce innovative features that extend
the vehicle's lifecycle through the integration of outsourced applications and
continuous Over-The-Air (OTA) updates. This shift necessitates robust
cybersecurity and system resilience. While research on Connected and Autonomous
Vehicles (CAV) has been extensive, there is a lack of clarity in distinguishing
SDVs from non-SDVs and a need to consolidate cybersecurity research. SDVs, with
their extensive connectivity, have a broader attack surface. Besides, their
software-centric nature introduces additional vulnerabilities. This paper
provides a comprehensive examination of SDVs, detailing their ecosystem,
enabling technologies, and the principal cyberattack entry points that arise
from their architectural and operational characteristics. We also introduce a
novel, layered taxonomy that maps concrete exploit techniques onto core SDV

### [23] [Fortifying LLM-Based Code Generation with Graph-Based Reasoning on Secure Coding Practices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09682)
*Rupam Patir,Keyan Guo,Haipeng Cai,Hongxin Hu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces GRASP, a new method focusing on structured reasoning over Secure Coding Practices (SCPs) to improve LLM-generated code security, addressing resource intensity and adaptability issues of existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods to strengthen LLMs for secure code generation are resource-intensive, less adaptable to zero-day vulnerabilities, and often inapplicable to proprietary models.

Method: GRASP uses an SCP graph (organizing SCPs into a DAG with dependencies) and a graph-based reasoning process to guide LLMs through relevant SCPs for code generation.

Result: GRASP achieves Security Rates (SR) exceeding 80% across multiple LLMs and up to 88% improvements over baselines on zero-day vulnerabilities.

Conclusion: GRASP enables interpretable, model-agnostic, and scalable security improvements for LLM-generated code, particularly for unseen vulnerabilities.

Abstract: The code generation capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have
transformed the field of software development. However, this advancement also
presents significant security challenges, as LLM-generated code often contains
vulnerabilities. One direction of research strengthens LLMs by injecting or
refining security knowledge through curated datasets, model tuning, or static
analyzers. While effective in certain settings, these methods can be
resource-intensive, less adaptable to zero-day vulnerabilities, and often
inapplicable to proprietary models. To address these challenges, we introduce
GRASP, which explores a new direction that focuses on structured reasoning over
Secure Coding Practices(SCPs) rather than additional training or external
feedback. GRASP comprises two key ideas: (1) an SCP graph that organizes SCPs
into a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) capturing dependencies and relationships,
and (2) a graph-based reasoning process that systematically guides LLMs through
relevant SCPs for code generation. This design enables interpretable,
model-agnostic, and scalable security improvements, particularly for previously
unseen vulnerabilities. Our evaluation shows that GRASP consistently achieves
Security Rates (SR) exceeding 80% across multiple LLMs, and delivers up to 88%
improvements over baselines on zero-day vulnerabilities.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces CREST-Search, a framework for red teaming LLMs with web search to expose safety risks, using adversarial query generation via in-context learning, iterative feedback, and a dataset (WebSearch-Harm), showing effectiveness in bypassing safety filters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs with web search face amplified safety risks from adversarial prompts and untrusted sources, which existing red teaming methods for standalone LLMs fail to address.

Method: CREST-Search framework generates adversarial queries via in-context learning, refines them through iterative feedback, and uses WebSearch-Harm dataset to fine-tune red-teaming agents.

Result: CREST-Search effectively bypasses safety filters and reveals vulnerabilities in modern web-augmented LLMs.

Conclusion: Specialized defenses are needed to ensure trustworthy deployment of web-augmented LLMs due to exposed vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at tasks such as dialogue, summarization,
and question answering, yet they struggle to adapt to specialized domains and
evolving facts. To overcome this, web search has been integrated into LLMs,
allowing real-time access to online content. However, this connection magnifies
safety risks, as adversarial prompts combined with untrusted sources can cause
severe vulnerabilities. We investigate red teaming for LLMs with web search and
present CREST-Search, a framework that systematically exposes risks in such
systems. Unlike existing methods for standalone LLMs, CREST-Search addresses
the complex workflow of search-enabled models by generating adversarial queries
with in-context learning and refining them through iterative feedback. We
further construct WebSearch-Harm, a search-specific dataset to fine-tune LLMs
into efficient red-teaming agents. Experiments show that CREST-Search
effectively bypasses safety filters and reveals vulnerabilities in modern
web-augmented LLMs, underscoring the need for specialized defenses to ensure
trustworthy deployment.

Motivation: The absence of a unified architectural and compliance framework in cloud computing impedes interoperability, auditability, and robust security.

Method: The model integrates ISO/IEC 22123 (taxonomy), 27001:2022, and TR 3445:2022 (security/compliance controls), decomposes cloud systems into four canonical interfaces (Control, Business, Audit, Data), extends with a security ontology mapping mechanisms to compliance controls, and is expressed in RDF/Turtle.

Result: The model enables semantic reasoning, automated compliance validation, vendor-neutral architecture design; practical utility is demonstrated through OpenStack and AWS case studies with reproducible validation workflows using SPARQL and SHACL.

Conclusion: This work advances cloud security modeling by bridging architectural and compliance standards in a unified framework, emphasizing auditability.

Abstract: Cloud computing has become the foundation of modern digital infrastructure,
yet the absence of a unified architectural and compliance framework impedes
interoperability, auditability, and robust security. This paper introduces a
formal, machine-readable semantic model for Cloud Engines, integrating the
architectural taxonomy of ISO/IEC 22123 (Cloud Reference Architecture) with the
security and compliance controls of ISO/IEC 27001:2022 and ISO/IEC TR
3445:2022. The model decomposes cloud systems into four canonical
interfaces--Control, Business, Audit, and Data--and extends them with a
security ontology that maps mechanisms such as authentication, authorization,
and encryption to specific compliance controls. Expressed in RDF/Turtle, the
model enables semantic reasoning, automated compliance validation, and
vendor-neutral architecture design. We demonstrate its practical utility
through OpenStack and AWS case studies, and provide reproducible validation
workflows using SPARQL and SHACL. This work advances the state of cloud
security modeling by bridging architectural and compliance standards in a

*Aofan Liu,Lulu Tang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This work introduces VisualDAN, an adversarial image embedded with DAN-style commands, to jailbreak Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by tricking them into producing harmful responses, with experiments showing effectiveness on models like MiniGPT-4 and LLaVA, highlighting the need for robust defenses against image-based attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Securing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) against jailbreak attacks is a challenge, as they have novel vulnerabilities like image hijacking unlike text-only models, which can manipulate the model into producing inappropriate or harmful responses.

Method: Inspiration from text-based DAN jailbreaks, VisualDAN is introduced: prepend harmful corpora with affirmative prefixes, train an adversarial image on these DAN-inspired harmful texts, and transform it into the text domain to elicit malicious outputs.

Result: Extensive experiments on models such as MiniGPT-4, MiniGPT-v2, InstructBLIP, and LLaVA show VisualDAN effectively bypasses VLM safeguards, forcing them to execute a broad range of harmful instructions violating ethical standards, and even small toxic content amplifies harmful outputs once defenses are compromised.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the urgent need for robust defenses against image-based attacks and offer critical insights for future research into the alignment and security of VLMs.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have garnered significant attention for their
remarkable ability to interpret and generate multimodal content. However,
securing these models against jailbreak attacks continues to be a substantial
challenge. Unlike text-only models, VLMs integrate additional modalities,
introducing novel vulnerabilities such as image hijacking, which can manipulate
the model into producing inappropriate or harmful responses. Drawing
inspiration from text-based jailbreaks like the "Do Anything Now" (DAN)
command, this work introduces VisualDAN, a single adversarial image embedded
with DAN-style commands. Specifically, we prepend harmful corpora with
affirmative prefixes (e.g., "Sure, I can provide the guidance you need") to
trick the model into responding positively to malicious queries. The
adversarial image is then trained on these DAN-inspired harmful texts and
transformed into the text domain to elicit malicious outputs. Extensive
experiments on models such as MiniGPT-4, MiniGPT-v2, InstructBLIP, and LLaVA
reveal that VisualDAN effectively bypasses the safeguards of aligned VLMs,
forcing them to execute a broad range of harmful instructions that severely
violate ethical standards. Our results further demonstrate that even a small
amount of toxic content can significantly amplify harmful outputs once the
model's defenses are compromised. These findings highlight the urgent need for
robust defenses against image-based attacks and offer critical insights for
future research into the alignment and security of VLMs.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper presents SAJD, a self-adaptive jammer detection framework for O-RAN environments that autonomously detects jamming attacks using ML-based xApp and rApps, outperforming state-of-the-art offline-trained xApp in accuracy and adaptability under dynamic interference scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Jamming attacks in O-RAN are a security concern that can severely undermine network performance, and existing detection methods (offline trained with manual labels) lack adaptability.

Method: SAJD forms a closed-loop system with near-realtime inference via an ML-based xApp and continuous monitoring/retraining pipelines through rApps.

Result: SAJD outperforms state-of-the-art jamming detection xApp (offline trained with manual labels) in accuracy and adaptability under various dynamic and previously unseen interference scenarios in an O-RAN-compliant testbed.

Conclusion: SAJD is an effective self-adaptive jammer detection framework for AI/ML-integrated O-RAN environments, addressing jamming attack security concerns with improved accuracy and adaptability.

Abstract: The open radio access network (O-RAN) enables modular, intelligent, and
programmable 5G network architectures through the adoption of software-defined
networking, network function virtualization, and implementation of standardized
open interfaces. However, one of the security concerns for O-RAN, which can
severely undermine network performance, is jamming attacks. This paper presents
SAJD- a self-adaptive jammer detection framework that autonomously detects
jamming attacks in AI/ML framework-integrated ORAN environments without human
intervention. The SAJD framework forms a closed-loop system that includes
near-realtime inference of radio signal jamming via our developed ML-based
xApp, as well as continuous monitoring and retraining pipelines through rApps.
In this demonstration, we will show how SAJD outperforms state-of-the-art
jamming detection xApp (offline trained with manual labels) in terms of
accuracy and adaptability under various dynamic and previously unseen

*Shaolun Liu,Sina Marefat,Omar Tsai,Yu Chen,Zecheng Deng,Jia Wang,Mohammad A. Tayebi*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: PrediQL is the first retrieval-augmented, LLM-guided fuzzer for GraphQL APIs, combining LLM reasoning, adaptive feedback loops, multi-armed bandit strategy, retrieval of execution traces/schema fragments/errors, and context-aware vulnerability detection to generate semantically valid/diverse queries and improve coverage and vulnerability discovery rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GraphQL APIs face complex, context-dependent vulnerabilities hard to uncover with conventional testing tools; existing fuzzers rely on random payloads or rigid mutation heuristics, failing to adapt to dynamic schema and response structures.

Method: PrediQL combines LLM reasoning with adaptive feedback loops, models fuzzing strategy as a multi-armed bandit problem (balancing exploration/exploitation), retrieves and reuses execution traces/schema fragments/prior errors for self-correction and learning, and integrates a context-aware vulnerability detector using LLM reasoning to analyze responses.

Result: Evaluation across open-source and benchmark GraphQL APIs shows PrediQL achieves significantly higher coverage and vulnerability discovery rates than state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: Combining retrieval-augmented reasoning with adaptive fuzzing transforms API security testing from reactive enumeration to intelligent exploration.

Abstract: GraphQL's flexible query model and nested data dependencies expose APIs to
complex, context-dependent vulnerabilities that are difficult to uncover using
conventional testing tools. Existing fuzzers either rely on random payload
generation or rigid mutation heuristics, failing to adapt to the dynamic
structures of GraphQL schemas and responses. We present PrediQL, the first
retrieval-augmented, LLM-guided fuzzer for GraphQL APIs. PrediQL combines large
language model reasoning with adaptive feedback loops to generate semantically
valid and diverse queries. It models the choice of fuzzing strategy as a
multi-armed bandit problem, balancing exploration of new query structures with
exploitation of past successes. To enhance efficiency, PrediQL retrieves and
reuses execution traces, schema fragments, and prior errors, enabling
self-correction and progressive learning across test iterations. Beyond input
generation, PrediQL integrates a context-aware vulnerability detector that uses
LLM reasoning to analyze responses, interpreting data values, error messages,
and status codes to identify issues such as injection flaws, access-control
bypasses, and information disclosure. Our evaluation across open-source and
benchmark GraphQL APIs shows that PrediQL achieves significantly higher
coverage and vulnerability discovery rates compared to state-of-the-art
baselines. These results demonstrate that combining retrieval-augmented
reasoning with adaptive fuzzing can transform API security testing from
reactive enumeration to intelligent exploration.

### [30] [Zk-SNARK Marketplace with Proof of Useful Work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09729)
*Samuel Oleksak,Richard Gazdik,Martin Peresini,Ivan Homoliak*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper proposes a Proof of Useful Work (PoUW) consensus protocol that uses client-outsourced zk-SNARK proofs to secure the blockchain, addressing energy waste in PoW and designing a decentralized marketplace for zk-SNARK proof generation at the consensus layer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To alleviate excessive electric energy waste caused by Proof of Work (PoW)'s computationally intensive yet externally useless puzzles, while ensuring the new consensus protocol meets PoW's necessary requirements which existing PoUW proposals often fail to do.

Method: The proposed PoUW consensus protocol computes client-outsourced zk-SNARK proofs as a byproduct to secure the consensus protocol, and leverages this mechanism to design a decentralized marketplace for outsourcing zk-SNARK proof generation operating at the consensus layer.

Result: The proposed protocol meets all necessary properties of PoW and creates a decentralized marketplace for zk-SNARK proof generation, which is the first such marketplace at the consensus layer.

Conclusion: The proposed PoUW protocol with zk-SNARK outsourcing addresses PoW's energy issues, meets PoW requirements, and establishes a novel decentralized marketplace for zk-SNARK proof generation at the consensus layer.

Abstract: Proof of Work (PoW) is widely regarded as the most secure permissionless
blockchain consensus protocol. However, its reliance on computationally
intensive yet externally useless puzzles results in excessive electric energy
wasting. To alleviate this, Proof of Useful Work (PoUW) has been explored as an
alternative to secure blockchain platforms while also producing real-world
value. Despite this promise, existing PoUW proposals often fail to embed the
integrity of the chain and identity of the miner into the puzzle solutions, not
meeting necessary requirements for PoW and thus rendering them vulnerable. In
this work, we propose a PoUW consensus protocol that computes client-outsourced
zk-SNARKs proofs as a byproduct, which are at the same time used to secure the
consensus protocol. We further leverage this mechanism to design a
decentralized marketplace for outsourcing zk-SNARK proof generation, which is,
to the best of our knowledge, the first such marketplace operating at the
consensus layer, while meeting all necessary properties of PoW.

### [31] [Secret-Key Agreement Through Hidden Markov Modeling of Wavelet Scattering Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09773)
*Nora Basha,Bechir Hamdaoui,Attila A. Yavuz,Thang Hoang,Mehran Mozaffari Kermani*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel secret-key generation approach using wavelet scattering networks to extract robust CSI features, dimensionality reduction for hidden clusters, and hidden Markov models for key agreement, eliminating quantization and achieving 5x higher key generation rate than traditional methods for resource-constrained IoT networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing secret-key generation approaches based on wireless channel reciprocity rely on instantaneous channel measurement similarity, which is impractical due to noise, asynchronous sampling, channel fading, and system imperfections; quantization in traditional schemes also causes irreversible errors, limiting efficiency.

Method: The approach uses wavelet scattering networks to extract robust and reciprocal CSI features, applies dimensionality reduction to uncover hidden cluster structures, and builds hidden Markov models for efficient key agreement.

Result: It eliminates the need for quantization, effectively captures channel randomness, and achieves a 5x improvement in key generation rate compared to traditional benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides a secure and efficient solution for key generation in resource-constrained IoT environments.

Abstract: Secret-key generation and agreement based on wireless channel reciprocity
offers a promising avenue for securing IoT networks. However, existing
approaches predominantly rely on the similarity of instantaneous channel
measurement samples between communicating devices. This narrow view of
reciprocity is often impractical, as it is highly susceptible to noise,
asynchronous sampling, channel fading, and other system-level imperfections --
all of which significantly impair key generation performance. Furthermore, the
quantization step common in traditional schemes introduces irreversible errors,
further limiting efficiency. In this work, we propose a novel approach for
secret-key generation by using wavelet scattering networks to extract robust
and reciprocal CSI features. Dimensionality reduction is applied to uncover
hidden cluster structures, which are then used to build hidden Markov models
for efficient key agreement. Our approach eliminates the need for quantization
and effectively captures channel randomness. It achieves a 5x improvement in
key generation rate compared to traditional benchmarks, providing a secure and
efficient solution for key generation in resource-constrained IoT environments.

### [32] [HTTP Request Synchronization Defeats Discrepancy Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09952)
*Cem Topcuoglu,Kaan Onarlioglu,Steven Sprecher,Engin Kirda*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper proposes HTTP Request Synchronization, a defense against discrepancy attacks in web proxies by propagating request processing history for consistency validation across hops, implemented in 5 popular proxies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discrepancy attacks (e.g., web cache poisoning, request smuggling) are surging due to differing proxy processing of HTTP requests, and there is no systemic defense.

Method: HTTP Request Synchronization uses standard HTTP extensions to augment requests with a complete processing history, propagating this context through the traffic path to enable each proxy to validate processing consistency with previous hops.

Result: The scheme is implemented for 5 popular proxy technologies: Apache, NGINX, HAProxy, Varnish, and Cloudflare, demonstrating practical impact.

Conclusion: HTTP Request Synchronization provides the first comprehensive defense against discrepancy attacks by ensuring consistent request processing across proxy hops via shared processing history.

Abstract: Contemporary web application architectures involve many layers of proxy
services that process traffic. Due to the complexity of HTTP and vendor design
decisions, these proxies sometimes process a given request in different ways.
Attackers can exploit these processing discrepancies to launch damaging attacks
including web cache poisoning and request smuggling. Discrepancy attacks are
surging, yet, there exists no systemic defense.
  In this work, we propose the first comprehensive defense to address this
problem, called HTTP Request Synchronization. Our scheme uses standard HTTP
extension mechanisms to augment each request with a complete processing
history. It propagates this context through the traffic path detailing how each
server hop has processed said request. Using this history, every proxy server
can validate that their processing is consistent with all previous hops,
eliminating discrepancy attacks. We implement our scheme for 5 popular proxy
technologies, Apache, NGINX, HAProxy, Varnish, and Cloudflare, demonstrating
its practical impact.

*Nges Brian Njungle,Eric Jahns,Luigi Mastromauro,Edwin P. Kayang,Milan Stojkov,Michel A. Kinsy*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces Prismo, an open-source recommendation system to help select optimal parameters and frameworks for privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML) scenarios, addressing the challenge of choosing suitable PPML frameworks amid trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is the complexity and critical challenge for developers to select the optimal PPML framework and parameters for specific deployment scenarios despite advancements in PPML frameworks.

Method: The method involves developing Prismo, an open-source recommendation system that allows users to explore PPML frameworks through properties based on user-defined objectives, supports automated filtering of candidates considering parameters like number of parties and computation cost, and models use cases into Linear Integer Programming optimization problems.

Result: The result is that Prismo is evaluated through multiple use cases, demonstrating its ability to deliver best-fit solutions in different deployment scenarios.

Conclusion: Prismo effectively aids in selecting optimal PPML parameters and frameworks for specific application scenarios by addressing the selection challenge.

Abstract: Machine learning has become a crucial part of our lives, with applications
spanning nearly every aspect of our daily activities. However, using personal
information in machine learning applications has sparked significant security
and privacy concerns about user data. To address these challenges, different
privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML) frameworks have been developed to
protect sensitive information in machine learning applications. These
frameworks generally attempt to balance design trade-offs such as computational
efficiency, communication overhead, security guarantees, and scalability.
Despite the advancements, selecting the optimal framework and parameters for
specific deployment scenarios remains a complex and critical challenge for
privacy and security application developers.
  We present Prismo, an open-source recommendation system designed to aid in
selecting optimal parameters and frameworks for different PPML application
scenarios. Prismo enables users to explore a comprehensive space of PPML
frameworks through various properties based on user-defined objectives. It
supports automated filtering of suitable candidate frameworks by considering
parameters such as the number of parties in multi-party computation or
federated learning and computation cost constraints in homomorphic encryption.
Prismo models every use case into a Linear Integer Programming optimization
problem, ensuring tailored solutions are recommended for each scenario. We
evaluate Prismo's effectiveness through multiple use cases, demonstrating its
ability to deliver best-fit solutions in different deployment scenarios.

### [34] [SecureWebArena: A Holistic Security Evaluation Benchmark for LVLM-based Web Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10073)
*Zonghao Ying,Yangguang Shao,Jianle Gan,Gan Xu,Junjie Shen,Wenxin Zhang,Quanchen Zou,Junzheng Shi,Zhenfei Yin,Mingchuan Zhang,Aishan Liu,Xianglong Liu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper presents \tool{}, the first holistic benchmark for evaluating the security of LVLM-based web agents, which includes six simulated web environments, 2,970 trajectories, a taxonomy of six attack vectors, and a multi-layered evaluation protocol, with experiments on 9 LVLMs showing consistent vulnerabilities and trade-offs between specialization and security.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing security evaluation benchmarks for LVLM-based web agents have partial coverage, restricted to narrow scenarios like user-level prompt manipulation, failing to capture broad agent vulnerabilities.

Method: \tool{} introduces a unified evaluation suite with six simulated realistic web environments and 2,970 trajectories, a structured taxonomy of six attack vectors (user-level and environment-level), and a multi-layered evaluation protocol analyzing failures across internal reasoning, behavioral trajectory, and task outcome.

Result: Large-scale experiments on 9 representative LVLMs (general-purpose, agent-specialized, GUI-grounded) show all tested agents are consistently vulnerable to subtle adversarial manipulations, revealing critical trade-offs between model specialization and security.

Conclusion: \tool{} establishes a foundation for advancing trustworthy web agent deployment by providing a comprehensive benchmark suite and empirical insights into security challenges of modern LVLM-based web agents.

Abstract: Large vision-language model (LVLM)-based web agents are emerging as powerful
tools for automating complex online tasks. However, when deployed in real-world
environments, they face serious security risks, motivating the design of
security evaluation benchmarks. Existing benchmarks provide only partial
coverage, typically restricted to narrow scenarios such as user-level prompt
manipulation, and thus fail to capture the broad range of agent
vulnerabilities. To address this gap, we present \tool{}, the first holistic
benchmark for evaluating the security of LVLM-based web agents. \tool{} first
introduces a unified evaluation suite comprising six simulated but realistic
web environments (\eg, e-commerce platforms, community forums) and includes
2,970 high-quality trajectories spanning diverse tasks and attack settings. The
suite defines a structured taxonomy of six attack vectors spanning both
user-level and environment-level manipulations. In addition, we introduce a
multi-layered evaluation protocol that analyzes agent failures across three
critical dimensions: internal reasoning, behavioral trajectory, and task
outcome, facilitating a fine-grained risk analysis that goes far beyond simple
success metrics. Using this benchmark, we conduct large-scale experiments on 9
representative LVLMs, which fall into three categories: general-purpose,
agent-specialized, and GUI-grounded. Our results show that all tested agents
are consistently vulnerable to subtle adversarial manipulations and reveal
critical trade-offs between model specialization and security. By providing (1)
a comprehensive benchmark suite with diverse environments and a multi-layered
evaluation pipeline, and (2) empirical insights into the security challenges of
modern LVLM-based web agents, \tool{} establishes a foundation for advancing
trustworthy web agent deployment.

### [35] [Pharmacist: Safety Alignment Data Curation for Large Language Models against Harmful Fine-tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10085)
*Guozhi Liu,Qi Mu,Tiansheng Huang,Xinhua Wang,Li Shen,Weiwei Lin,Zhang Li*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Pharmacist is a safety alignment data curation solution that selects a high-quality, safety-critical core subset from original alignment data to enhance defense against harmful fine-tuning in large language models, outperforming existing methods in defense, inference performance, and reducing training time when integrated with mainstream alignment-stage defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing alignment-stage defenses against harmful fine-tuning overlook the critical role of original safety-alignment data quality and composition, limiting their defense performance and computational efficiency.

Method: Pharmacist trains an alignment data selector to rank alignment data, up-ranking high-quality and safety-critical data while down-ranking low-quality and non-safety-critical data, selecting a core subset from original alignment data.

Result: Models trained on Pharmacist-selected datasets outperform existing selection methods in defense and inference performance; when integrated with RepNoise and T-Vaccine, defense performance improves by 2.60% and 3.30%, inference by 3.50% and 1.10%, and training time reduces by 56.83% and 57.63% respectively.

Conclusion: Pharmacist effectively enhances defense against harmful fine-tuning by addressing alignment data quality/composition issues, integrates well with mainstream defenses, and improves efficiency and performance.

Abstract: Harmful fine-tuning issues present significant safety challenges for
fine-tuning-as-a-service in large language models. Existing alignment-stage
defenses, e.g., Vaccine, Repnoise, Booster, and T-Vaccine, mitigate harmful
fine-tuning issues by enhancing the model's robustness during the alignment
phase. While these methods have been proposed to mitigate the issue, they often
overlook a critical upstream factor: the role of the original safety-alignment
data. We observe that their defense performance and computational efficiency
remain constrained by the quality and composition of the alignment dataset. To
address this limitation, we propose Pharmacist, a safety alignment data
curation solution that enhances defense against harmful fine-tuning by
selecting a high-quality and safety-critical core subset from the original
alignment data. The core idea of Pharmacist is to train an alignment data
selector to rank alignment data. Specifically, up-ranking high-quality and
safety-critical alignment data, down-ranking low-quality and
non-safety-critical data. Empirical results indicate that models trained on
datasets selected by Pharmacist outperform those trained on datasets selected
by existing selection methods in both defense and inference performance. In
addition, Pharmacist can be effectively integrated with mainstream
alignment-stage defense methods. For example, when applied to RepNoise and
T-Vaccine, using the dataset selected by Pharmacist instead of the full dataset
leads to improvements in defense performance by 2.60\% and 3.30\%,
respectively, and enhances inference performance by 3.50\% and 1.10\%. Notably,
it reduces training time by 56.83\% and 57.63\%, respectively. Our code is

*Chaofang Shi,Zhongwen Li,Xiaoqi Li*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper systematically researches system password security, analyzing typical cracking methods (brute force, dictionary, rainbow table) and evaluating existing defensive measures via experiments with tools like John the Ripper and Hashcat on MD5, SHA-256, and bcrypt hashed datasets, then proposes improvement recommendations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Frequent password cracking attacks targeting system passwords pose a severe threat to information system security, necessitating in-depth research into attack methods and defensive technologies.

Method: The paper focuses on analyzing typical password cracking methods (brute force, dictionary, rainbow table) and evaluates existing defensive measures. Experiments use cryptanalysis tools (John the Ripper, Hashcat) to simulate attacks on five datasets hashed with MD5, SHA-256, and bcrypt, comparing hash algorithms and password complexity strategies.

Result: The effectiveness of defensive measures like salting and slow hashing algorithms is validated by comparing performance of different hash algorithms and password complexity strategies against attacks.

Conclusion: By integrating experimental data with recent research, the paper analyzes strengths/limitations of defense mechanisms (account lockout, multi-factor, risk adaptive authentication) and proposes feasible improvement recommendations and optimization strategies.

Abstract: System passwords serve as critical credentials for user authentication and
access control when logging into operating systems or applications. Upon
entering a valid password, users pass verification to access system resources
and execute corresponding operations. In recent years, frequent password
cracking attacks targeting system passwords have posed a severe threat to
information system security. To address this challenge, in-depth research into
password cracking attack methods and defensive technologies holds significant
importance. This paper conducts systematic research on system password
security, focusing on analyzing typical password cracking methods such as brute
force attacks, dictionary attacks, and rainbow table attacks, while evaluating
the effectiveness of existing defensive measures. The experimental section
utilizes common cryptanalysis tools, such as John the Ripper and Hashcat, to
simulate brute force and dictionary attacks. Five test datasets, each generated
using Message Digest Algorithm 5 (MD5), Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit (SHA
256), and bcrypt hash functions, are analyzed. By comparing the overall
performance of different hash algorithms and password complexity strategies
against these attacks, the effectiveness of defensive measures such as salting
and slow hashing algorithms is validated. Building upon this foundation, this
paper further evaluates widely adopted defense mechanisms, including account
lockout policies, multi-factor authentication, and risk adaptive
authentication. By integrating experimental data with recent research findings,
it analyzes the strengths and limitations of each approach while proposing
feasible improvement recommendations and optimization strategies.

### [37] [MetaBreak: Jailbreaking Online LLM Services via Special Token Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10271)
*Wentian Zhu,Zhen Xiang,Wei Niu,Le Guan*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates that special tokens in LLMs can be exploited to bypass internal safety alignment and external content moderation, introduces the MetaBreak method which outperforms SOTA prompt-engineering solutions in moderated environments and synergizes with them, and notes challenges in defense due to token replacement with semantically similar regular tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To show that special tokens used as metadata in LLM fine-tuning can be exploited to bypass safety alignment and content moderation systems, and address the challenge of defending against such threats.

Method: The authors developed MetaBreak, a method that exploits special tokens to construct attack primitives, evaluated it in lab and commercial LLM environments, and tested its performance against SOTA prompt-engineering solutions (PAP, GPTFuzzer) with and without content moderation, including synergistic use with them.

Result: MetaBreak achieves jailbreak rates comparable to SOTA prompt-engineering solutions without moderation; with moderation, it outperforms PAP by 11.6% and GPTFuzzer by 34.8%. When combined with PAP and GPTFuzzer, jailbreak rates increase by 24.3% and 20.2% respectively.

Conclusion: Special tokens are a critical vulnerability for LLM safety, MetaBreak is effective in bypassing moderation and synergizes with prompt engineering, and aggressive defense mechanisms like removing special tokens are less effective due to evasion via semantically similar regular tokens.

Abstract: Unlike regular tokens derived from existing text corpora, special tokens are
artificially created to annotate structured conversations during the
fine-tuning process of Large Language Models (LLMs). Serving as metadata of
training data, these tokens play a crucial role in instructing LLMs to generate
coherent and context-aware responses. We demonstrate that special tokens can be
exploited to construct four attack primitives, with which malicious users can
reliably bypass the internal safety alignment of online LLM services and
circumvent state-of-the-art (SOTA) external content moderation systems
simultaneously. Moreover, we found that addressing this threat is challenging,
as aggressive defense mechanisms-such as input sanitization by removing special
tokens entirely, as suggested in academia-are less effective than anticipated.
This is because such defense can be evaded when the special tokens are replaced
by regular ones with high semantic similarity within the tokenizer's embedding
space. We systemically evaluated our method, named MetaBreak, on both lab
environment and commercial LLM platforms. Our approach achieves jailbreak rates
comparable to SOTA prompt-engineering-based solutions when no content
moderation is deployed. However, when there is content moderation, MetaBreak
outperforms SOTA solutions PAP and GPTFuzzer by 11.6% and 34.8%, respectively.
Finally, since MetaBreak employs a fundamentally different strategy from prompt
engineering, the two approaches can work synergistically. Notably, empowering
MetaBreak on PAP and GPTFuzzer boosts jailbreak rates by 24.3% and 20.2%,
respectively.

*Guan-Yan Yang,Tzu-Yu Cheng,Ya-Wen Teng,Farn Wanga,Kuo-Hui Yeh*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces ArtPerception, a novel black-box jailbreak framework using ASCII art to bypass LLM security measures, with a two-phase methodology and Modified Levenshtein Distance metric, demonstrating superior performance on open-source and commercial LLMs and highlighting the need for multi-modal interpretation defense.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM safety alignments focus on semantic interpretation, leaving LLMs vulnerable to attacks using non-standard data representations.

Method: ArtPerception uses a two-phase methodology: Phase 1 conducts a one-time model-specific pre-test to determine optimal ASCII art recognition parameters; Phase 2 leverages these insights for a one-shot malicious jailbreak attack, with a Modified Levenshtein Distance (MLD) metric for evaluation.

Result: Comprehensive experiments show superior jailbreak performance on four SOTA open-source LLMs, successful transferability to commercial models (GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 3.7, DeepSeek-V3), and effectiveness against defenses like LLaMA Guard and Azure's content filters.

Conclusion: True LLM security requires defending against a multi-modal space of interpretations even within text-only inputs, and strategic reconnaissance-based attacks are effective.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into computer applications
has introduced transformative capabilities but also significant security
challenges. Existing safety alignments, which primarily focus on semantic
interpretation, leave LLMs vulnerable to attacks that use non-standard data
representations. This paper introduces ArtPerception, a novel black-box
jailbreak framework that strategically leverages ASCII art to bypass the
security measures of state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs. Unlike prior methods that
rely on iterative, brute-force attacks, ArtPerception introduces a systematic,
two-phase methodology. Phase 1 conducts a one-time, model-specific pre-test to
empirically determine the optimal parameters for ASCII art recognition. Phase 2
leverages these insights to launch a highly efficient, one-shot malicious
jailbreak attack. We propose a Modified Levenshtein Distance (MLD) metric for a
more nuanced evaluation of an LLM's recognition capability. Through
comprehensive experiments on four SOTA open-source LLMs, we demonstrate
superior jailbreak performance. We further validate our framework's real-world
relevance by showing its successful transferability to leading commercial
models, including GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 3.7, and DeepSeek-V3, and by conducting
a rigorous effectiveness analysis against potential defenses such as LLaMA
Guard and Azure's content filters. Our findings underscore that true LLM
security requires defending against a multi-modal space of interpretations,
even within text-only inputs, and highlight the effectiveness of strategic,
reconnaissance-based attacks. Content Warning: This paper includes potentially
harmful and offensive model outputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a comprehensive practical reference for researchers and practitioners planning quantum-safe systems by bridging standards, engineering, and operations as NIST finalizes PQC standards and PQC moves from evaluation to deployment.

Method: Developing a taxonomy across various PQC families (lattice-, code-, hash-, multivariate-, isogeny-, MPC-in-the-Head), comparing performance/communication costs via implementation-grounded measurements, reviewing hardware acceleration and implementation security, examining protocol integration, PKI, deployment in environments, discussing complementarity with quantum technologies, and emphasizing crypto-agility, hybrid migration, and evidence-based guidance.

Result: A comprehensive mapping of the PQC space from foundations to practice, including insights into taxonomy, performance, protocol integration, deployment, complementarity with quantum technologies, and identification of open problems (parameter agility, leakage-resilient implementations, domain-specific rollout playbooks).

Conclusion: The survey serves as a practical reference for researchers and practitioners planning quantum-safe systems, with open problems spanning parameter agility, leakage-resilient implementations, and domain-specific rollout playbooks.

Abstract: Post-quantum cryptography (PQC) is moving from evaluation to deployment as
NIST finalizes standards for ML-KEM, ML-DSA, and SLH-DSA. This survey maps the
space from foundations to practice. We first develop a taxonomy across
lattice-, code-, hash-, multivariate-, isogeny-, and MPC-in-the-Head families,
summarizing security assumptions, cryptanalysis, and standardization status. We
then compare performance and communication costs using representative,
implementation-grounded measurements, and review hardware acceleration (AVX2,
FPGA/ASIC) and implementation security with a focus on side-channel resistance.
Building upward, we examine protocol integration (TLS, DNSSEC), PKI and
certificate hygiene, and deployment in constrained and high-assurance
environments (IoT, cloud, finance, blockchain). We also discuss complementarity
with quantum technologies (QKD, QRNGs) and the limits of near-term quantum
computing. Throughout, we emphasize crypto-agility, hybrid migration, and
evidence-based guidance for operators. We conclude with open problems spanning
parameter agility, leakage-resilient implementations, and domain-specific
rollout playbooks. This survey aims to be a practical reference for researchers
and practitioners planning quantum-safe systems, bridging standards,

*Ming Tan,Wei Li,Hu Tao,Hailong Ma,Aodi Liu,Qian Chen,Zilong Wang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper formalizes stego attacks on open-source LLMs, proposes SASER, the first such attack, showing it outperforms existing stego attacks in stealth rate and achieves 100% ASR on both non-quantized and quantized models, and calls for countermeasure research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-source LLMs have full access to source codes, parameters, and training data, laying groundwork for transparency but being vulnerable to stego attacks with ill-effects not fully understood.

Method: Systematically formalizes stego attacks by enumerating threat models; proposes SASER, which identifies targeted parameters, embeds payloads, injects triggers, executes payloads sequentially, enhances robustness against quantization via de-quantizing payloads, and uses performance-aware importance metric for stealthiness.

Result: On LlaMA2-7B and ChatGLM3-6B (non-quantized), SASER's stealth rate outperforms existing stego attacks by up to 98.1% with 100% ASR; on quantized models, improves ASR from 0 to 100% in all settings.

Conclusion: SASER is highly effective, and investigations on countermeasures against it are needed.

Abstract: Open-source large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated considerable
dominance over proprietary LLMs in resolving neural processing tasks, thanks to
the collaborative and sharing nature. Although full access to source codes,
model parameters, and training data lays the groundwork for transparency, we
argue that such a full-access manner is vulnerable to stego attacks, and their
ill-effects are not fully understood. In this paper, we conduct a systematic
formalization for stego attacks on open-source LLMs by enumerating all possible
threat models associated with adversary objectives, knowledge, and
capabilities. Therein, the threat posed by adversaries with internal knowledge,
who inject payloads and triggers during the model sharing phase, is of
practical interest. We go even further and propose the first stego attack on
open-source LLMs, dubbed SASER, which wields impacts through identifying
targeted parameters, embedding payloads, injecting triggers, and executing
payloads sequentially. Particularly, SASER enhances the attack robustness
against quantization-based local deployment by de-quantizing the embedded
payloads. In addition, to achieve stealthiness, SASER devises the
performance-aware importance metric to identify targeted parameters with the
least degradation of model performance. Extensive experiments on LlaMA2-7B and
ChatGLM3-6B, without quantization, show that the stealth rate of SASER
outperforms existing stego attacks (for general DNNs) by up to 98.1%, while
achieving the same attack success rate (ASR) of 100%. More importantly, SASER
improves ASR on quantized models from 0 to 100% in all settings. We appeal for
investigations on countermeasures against SASER in view of the significant
attack effectiveness.

*Léo Ducas,Lynn Engelberts,Paola de Perthuis*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper conducts a concrete average-case analysis of module-lattice reduction, focusing on the expected slope after running module-BKZ and identifying the discriminant of the number field as the key factor driving this slope, with implications for the required blocksize compared to unstructured BKZ in different cyclotomic fields.


<details>

Motivation: To address whether module-lattice reduction is better than unstructured lattice reduction, which was highlighted as 'Q8' in the Kyber NIST standardization submission and potentially affects the concrete security of module-lattice-based schemes, given that previous foundational works only focused on provable worst-case asymptotic behavior.

Method: The paper presents a concrete average-case analysis of module-lattice reduction, specifically addressing the expected slope after running module-BKZ, pinpointing the discriminant of the number field as the main quantity, converting this into a gain or loss on the blocksize, and using experimentally verified heuristics to predict further terms, along with providing the first open-source implementation of module-BKZ for some cyclotomic fields.

Result: For power-of-two cyclotomic fields, module-BKZ requires a blocksize larger than unstructured BKZ by d-1+o(1); for other cyclotomic fields, module-BKZ provides a sublinear Θ(β/log β) gain on the required blocksize, yielding a subexponential speedup of exp(Θ(β/log β)).

Conclusion: The discriminant of the number field drives the expected slope of module-BKZ, leading to different blocksize requirements compared to unstructured BKZ in various cyclotomic fields, with module-BKZ being worse in power-of-two cyclotomic fields but better (subexponential speedup) in others.

Abstract: Is module-lattice reduction better than unstructured lattice reduction? This
question was highlighted as 'Q8' in the Kyber NIST standardization submission
(Avanzi et al., 2021), as potentially affecting the concrete security of Kyber
and other module-lattice-based schemes. Foundational works on module-lattice
reduction (Lee, Pellet-Mary, Stehl\'e, and Wallet, ASIACRYPT 2019; Mukherjee
and Stephens-Davidowitz, CRYPTO 2020) confirmed the existence of such module
variants of LLL and block-reduction algorithms, but focus only on provable
worst-case asymptotic behavior.
  In this work, we present a concrete average-case analysis of module-lattice
reduction. Specifically, we address the question of the expected slope after
running module-BKZ, and pinpoint the discriminant $\Delta_K$ of the number
field at hand as the main quantity driving this slope. We convert this back
into a gain or loss on the blocksize $\beta$: module-BKZ in a number field $K$
of degree $d$ requires an SVP oracle of dimension $\beta + \log(|\Delta_K| /
d^d)\beta /(d\log \beta) + o(\beta / \log \beta)$ to reach the same slope as
unstructured BKZ with blocksize $\beta$. This asymptotic summary hides further
terms that we predict concretely using experimentally verified heuristics.
Incidentally, we provide the first open-source implementation of module-BKZ for
some cyclotomic fields.
  For power-of-two cyclotomic fields, we have $|\Delta_K| = d^d$, and conclude
that module-BKZ requires a blocksize larger than its unstructured counterpart
by $d-1+o(1)$. On the contrary, for all other cyclotomic fields we have
$|\Delta_K| < d^d$, so module-BKZ provides a sublinear $\Theta(\beta/\log
\beta)$ gain on the required blocksize, yielding a subexponential speedup of
$\exp(\Theta(\beta/\log \beta))$.

### [43] [Toxic Ink on Immutable Paper: Content Moderation for Ethereum Input Data Messages (IDMs)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10761)
*Xihan Xiong,Zhipeng Wang,Qin Wang,William Knottenbelt*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper addresses the issue of toxic content in Ethereum Input Data Messages (IDMs) due to lack of protocol-level moderation, proposing two frameworks (BUILDERMOD and USERMOD), with USERMOD being more practical due to lower latency and better scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing volume of toxic content in Ethereum Input Data Messages (IDMs) as they gain wider adoption, with Ethereum providing no protocol-level support for content moderation.

Method: Proposing two moderation frameworks: BUILDERMOD (builders perform semantic checks during block construction) and USERMOD (users embed moderation proofs from external classifiers in transactions), and evaluating their practicality.

Result: BUILDERMOD incurs high block-time overhead limiting practicality; USERMOD enables lower-latency validation and scales more effectively, making it more practical.

Conclusion: The study lays groundwork for protocol-level content governance in decentralized systems, contributing to a safe, trustworthy, and socially responsible decentralized communication environment.

Abstract: Decentralized communication is becoming an important use case within Web3. On
Ethereum, users can repurpose the transaction input data field to embed
natural-language messages, commonly known as Input Data Messages (IDMs).
However, as IDMs gain wider adoption, there has been a growing volume of toxic
content on-chain. This trend is concerning, as Ethereum provides no
protocol-level support for content moderation.
  We propose two moderation frameworks for Ethereum IDMs: (i) BUILDERMOD, where
builders perform semantic checks during block construction; and (ii) USERMOD,
where users proactively obtain moderation proofs from external classifiers and
embed them in transactions. Our evaluation reveals that BUILDERMOD incurs high
block-time overhead, which limits its practicality. In contrast, USERMOD
enables lower-latency validation and scales more effectively, making it a more
practical approach in moderation-aware Ethereum environments.
  Our study lays the groundwork for protocol-level content governance in
decentralized systems, and we hope it contributes to the development of a
decentralized communication environment that is safe, trustworthy, and socially
responsible.

*Ahmad Mohammadi,Reza Ahmari,Vahid Hemmati,Frederick Owusu-Ambrose,Mahmoud Nabil Mahmoud,Parham Kebria,Abdollah Homaifar,Mehrdad Saif*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This study presents an adaptive GPS spoofing detection approach using a dynamically tuned DBSCAN algorithm, which adjusts the detection threshold (ε) in real-time based on recursive mean and standard deviation of displacement errors from non-anomalous instances, with an initial threshold from 120,000 clean data samples. It achieves high detection accuracies (98.38%-99.96%) against various GPS spoofing attacks using real-world HDD dataset subsets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous vehicles are increasingly vulnerable to GPS spoofing attacks as they become essential in modern transportation.

Method: An adaptive detection approach utilizing a dynamically tuned DBSCAN algorithm, adjusting ε in real-time based on recursive mean and standard deviation of displacement errors between GPS and in-vehicle sensors data (only at non-anomalous instances), with an initial threshold from 120,000 clean data samples.

Result: The modified algorithm effectively identifies turn-by-turn, stop, overshoot, and multiple small biased spoofing attacks, achieving detection accuracies of 98.621%, 99.960.1%, 99.880.1%, and 98.380.1%, respectively, using five subsets from the real-world HDD dataset simulating large and small magnitude attacks.

Conclusion: This work provides a substantial advancement in enhancing the security and safety of AVs against GPS spoofing threats.

Abstract: As autonomous vehicles become an essential component of modern
transportation, they are increasingly vulnerable to threats such as GPS
spoofing attacks. This study presents an adaptive detection approach utilizing
a dynamically tuned Density Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise
(DBSCAN) algorithm, designed to adjust the detection threshold ({\epsilon}) in
real-time. The threshold is updated based on the recursive mean and standard
deviation of displacement errors between GPS and in-vehicle sensors data, but
only at instances classified as non-anomalous. Furthermore, an initial
threshold, determined from 120,000 clean data samples, ensures the capability
to identify even subtle and gradual GPS spoofing attempts from the beginning.
To assess the performance of the proposed method, five different subsets from
the real-world Honda Research Institute Driving Dataset (HDD) are selected to
simulate both large and small magnitude GPS spoofing attacks. The modified
algorithm effectively identifies turn-by-turn, stop, overshoot, and multiple
small biased spoofing attacks, achieving detection accuracies of 98.621%,
99.960.1%, 99.880.1%, and 98.380.1%, respectively. This work provides a
substantial advancement in enhancing the security and safety of AVs against GPS
spoofing threats.

### [45] [A Symmetric-Key Cryptosystem Based on the Burnside Ring of a Compact Lie Group](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10901)
*Ziad Ghanem*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a symmetric-key cryptosystem using the Burnside ring of a compact Lie group (emphasizing G=O(2)) to address vulnerabilities of classical linear ciphers, analyzes its security, and shows it is not IND-CPA secure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical linear ciphers (e.g., Hill cipher) are vulnerable to known-plaintext attacks as they operate on fixed finite-dimensional modules, with the key recoverable as a fully determined linear operator.

Method: The cryptosystem uses the Burnside ring A(G) of a compact Lie group G (focusing on G=O(2)), with the secret key including G, a secret total ordering of the subgroup orbit-basis of A(G), and a finite set S of irreducible G-representations indices defining an involutory multiplier k in A(G). Messages are encoded as finitely supported elements of A(G) and encrypted via Burnside product with k.

Result: For G=O(2), encryption preserves plaintext support among specific generators, avoiding ciphertext expansion and security leakage; finite observations constrain action only on a finite-rank submodule W_L⊂A(O(2)), with information-theoretic non-identifiability of the key from such data.

Conclusion: The proposed symmetric-key cryptosystem addresses some vulnerabilities of classical linear ciphers but is not IND-CPA secure, as shown by a one-query chosen-plaintext distinguisher based on dihedral probes.

Abstract: Classical linear ciphers, such as the Hill cipher, operate on fixed,
finite-dimensional modules and are therefore vulnerable to straightforward
known-plaintext attacks that recover the key as a fully determined linear
operator. We propose a symmetric-key cryptosystem whose linear action takes
place instead in the Burnside ring $A(G)$ of a compact Lie group $G$, with
emphasis on the case $G=O(2)$. The secret key consists of (i) a compact Lie
group $G$; (ii) a secret total ordering of the subgroup orbit-basis of $A(G)$;
and (iii) a finite set $S$ of indices of irreducible $G$-representations, whose
associated basic degrees define an involutory multiplier $k\in A(G)$. Messages
of arbitrary finite length are encoded as finitely supported elements of $A(G)$
and encrypted via the Burnside product with $k$. For $G=O(2)$ we prove that
encryption preserves plaintext support among the generators
$\{(D_1),\dots,(D_L),(SO(2)),(O(2))\}$, avoiding ciphertext expansion and
security leakage. We then analyze security in passive models, showing that any
finite set of observations constrains the action only on a finite-rank
submodule $W_L\subset A(O(2))$, and we show information-theoretic
non-identifiability of the key from such data. Finally, we prove the scheme is
\emph{not} IND-CPA secure, by presenting a one-query chosen-plaintext
distinguisher based on dihedral probes.

*Zonghuan Xu,Xiang Zheng,Xingjun Ma,Yu-Gang Jiang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper studies targeted backdoor attacks on Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, introduces TabVLA framework via black-box fine-tuning, explores two inference-time threat models, formulates poisoned data generation as optimization, and finds vision channel is key attack surface with minimal poisoning success, while also investigating a detection defense.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing deployment of VLA models in real-world embodied AI systems faces increasing vulnerability to backdoor attacks, especially the practically threatening targeted manipulation scenario which prior work on untargeted attacks left unexamined.

Method: Introduce TabVLA, a novel framework enabling targeted backdoor attacks via black-box fine-tuning, explores two deployment-relevant inference-time threat models (input-stream editing and in-scene triggering), and formulates poisoned data generation as an optimization problem to improve attack effectiveness.

Result: Experiments with OpenVLA-7B on LIBERO benchmark show vision channel is principal attack surface: targeted backdoors succeed with minimal poisoning, remain robust across trigger design variations, and are degraded only by positional mismatches between fine-tuning and inference triggers; a detection-based defense reconstructs latent visual triggers to flag activation-conditioned backdoor samples.

Conclusion: VLA models are vulnerable to targeted backdoor manipulation, highlighting the need for more advanced defenses.

Abstract: With the growing deployment of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in
real-world embodied AI systems, their increasing vulnerability to backdoor
attacks poses a serious safety threat. A backdoored VLA agent can be covertly
triggered by a pre-injected backdoor to execute adversarial actions,
potentially causing system failures or even physical harm. Although backdoor
attacks on VLA models have been explored, prior work has focused only on
untargeted attacks, leaving the more practically threatening scenario of
targeted manipulation unexamined. In this paper, we study targeted backdoor
attacks on VLA models and introduce TabVLA, a novel framework that enables such
attacks via black-box fine-tuning. TabVLA explores two deployment-relevant
inference-time threat models: input-stream editing and in-scene triggering. It
formulates poisoned data generation as an optimization problem to improve
attack effectivess. Experiments with OpenVLA-7B on the LIBERO benchmark reveal
that the vision channel is the principal attack surface: targeted backdoors
succeed with minimal poisoning, remain robust across variations in trigger
design, and are degraded only by positional mismatches between fine-tuning and
inference triggers. We also investigate a potential detection-based defense
against TabVLA, which reconstructs latent visual triggers from the input stream
to flag activation-conditioned backdoor samples. Our work highlights the
vulnerability of VLA models to targeted backdoor manipulation and underscores
the need for more advanced defenses.

*Hyeseon Ahn,Shinwoo Park,Yo-Sub Han*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates that the core assumption of LLM watermarking (specific watermark proving authorship by a specific model) is flawed by introducing watermark spoofing, an attack allowing malicious models to generate text with a victim model's authentic-looking watermark, revealing a security gap in text authorship verification and calling for a paradigm shift.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the core assumption of LLM watermarking that a specific watermark proves authorship by a specific model, as this assumption may be flawed and enable harmful content misattribution.

Method: Introducing watermark spoofing attack, repurposing watermark radioactivity (unintended inheritance of data patterns during fine-tuning) from a discoverable trait into an attack vector, and distilling knowledge from a watermarked teacher model to steal and replicate the victim model's watermarking signal.

Result: The attack allows a malicious model to generate text containing the authentic-looking watermark of a trusted, victim model, enabling seamless misattribution of harmful content to reputable sources, revealing a critical security gap in text authorship verification.

Conclusion: This work reveals a critical security gap in text authorship verification and calls for a paradigm shift towards technologies capable of distinguishing authentic watermarks from expertly imitated ones.

Abstract: The promise of LLM watermarking rests on a core assumption that a specific
watermark proves authorship by a specific model. We demonstrate that this
assumption is dangerously flawed. We introduce the threat of watermark
spoofing, a sophisticated attack that allows a malicious model to generate text
containing the authentic-looking watermark of a trusted, victim model. This
enables the seamless misattribution of harmful content, such as disinformation,
to reputable sources. The key to our attack is repurposing watermark
radioactivity, the unintended inheritance of data patterns during fine-tuning,
from a discoverable trait into an attack vector. By distilling knowledge from a
watermarked teacher model, our framework allows an attacker to steal and
replicate the watermarking signal of the victim model. This work reveals a
critical security gap in text authorship verification and calls for a paradigm
shift towards technologies capable of distinguishing authentic watermarks from
expertly imitated ones. Our code is available at

### [48] [Secret-Protected Evolution for Differentially Private Synthetic Text Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10990)
*Tianze Wang,Zhaoyu Chen,Jian Du,Yingtai Xiao,Linjun Zhang,Qiang Yan*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper proposes Secret-Protected Evolution (SecPE), a novel framework for differentially private synthetic text generation that uses secret-aware protection to improve utility-privacy trade-offs and reduce computational complexity compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing differentially private (DP) synthetic text generation methods impose uniform guarantees, overprotecting non-sensitive content and leading to significant utility loss and computational overhead.

Method: The proposed SecPE framework extends private evolution with secret-aware protection, theoretically satisfying (p, r)-secret protection, a relaxation of Gaussian DP, to enable tighter utility-privacy trade-offs and lower computational complexity.

Result: Empirically, SecPE achieves lower Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) and higher downstream task accuracy than GDP-based Aug-PE baselines on OpenReview, PubMed, and Yelp benchmarks, while requiring less noise for the same protection level.

Conclusion: Secret-aware guarantees can unlock more practical and effective privacy-preserving synthetic text generation.

Abstract: Text data has become extremely valuable on large language models (LLMs) and
even lead to general artificial intelligence (AGI). A lot of high-quality text
in the real world is private and cannot be freely used due to privacy concerns.
Therefore, differentially private (DP) synthetic text generation has been
proposed, aiming to produce high-utility synthetic data while protecting
sensitive information. However, existing DP synthetic text generation imposes
uniform guarantees that often overprotect non-sensitive content, resulting in
substantial utility loss and computational overhead. Therefore, we propose
Secret-Protected Evolution (SecPE), a novel framework that extends private
evolution with secret-aware protection. Theoretically, we show that SecPE
satisfies $(\mathrm{p}, \mathrm{r})$-secret protection, constituting a
relaxation of Gaussian DP that enables tighter utility-privacy trade-offs,
while also substantially reducing computational complexity relative to baseline
methods. Empirically, across the OpenReview, PubMed, and Yelp benchmarks, SecPE
consistently achieves lower Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) and higher
downstream task accuracy than GDP-based Aug-PE baselines, while requiring less
noise to attain the same level of protection. Our results highlight that
secret-aware guarantees can unlock more practical and effective
privacy-preserving synthetic text generation.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper investigates the instability caused by oscillations in blockchain staking rates due to high APY sensitivity and staker response delays, proposing a novel inflation distribution model to stabilize the staking rate within a target range.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the undesirable oscillations around the equilibrium staking rate in blockchain systems using dynamically distributed inflation, caused by high APY sensitivity to staking rate changes and inherent feedback delays in staker responses.

Method: Analyzing the dynamics of inflation-based reward systems and proposing a novel distribution model designed to stabilize the staking rate.

Result: The proposed solution effectively dampens oscillations, stabilizing the yield within a target staking range.

Conclusion: The novel distribution model successfully stabilizes blockchain staking rates by mitigating oscillations induced by APY sensitivity and staker response delays.

Abstract: Dynamically distributed inflation is a common mechanism used to guide a
blockchain's staking rate towards a desired equilibrium between network
security and token liquidity.
  However, the high sensitivity of the annual percentage yield to changes in
the staking rate, coupled with the inherent feedback delays in staker
responses, can induce undesirable oscillations around this equilibrium.
  This paper investigates this instability phenomenon. We analyze the dynamics
of inflation-based reward systems and propose a novel distribution model
designed to stabilize the staking rate. Our solution effectively dampens
oscillations, stabilizing the yield within a target staking range.

*Incheol Baek,Yon Dohn Chung*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper proposes the N-output mechanism, a generalized framework for numerical data collection under Local Differential Privacy (LDP) to address the gap of lacking an optimal mechanism for arbitrary output size N, achieving high accuracy and adaptive design with low communication costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LDP mechanisms are optimized for very small (|Ω| ∈ {2, 3}) or infinite output spaces, but there is no generalized method for constructing an optimal mechanism for an arbitrary output size N.

Method: Formulate the mechanism's design as an optimization problem to minimize estimation variance for any given N ≥ 2, develop numerical and analytical solutions, and extend the framework and existing mechanisms to distribution estimation.

Result: The N-output mechanism achieves state-of-the-art accuracy for mean, variance, and distribution estimation with small communication costs.

Conclusion: The proposed N-output mechanism is a generalized, highly accurate, and adaptive framework for numerical data collection under LDP, filling the gap in optimal mechanisms for arbitrary output size N.

Abstract: Local Differential Privacy (LDP) addresses significant privacy concerns in
sensitive data collection. In this work, we focus on numerical data collection
under LDP, targeting a significant gap in the literature: existing LDP
mechanisms are optimized for either a very small ($|\Omega| \in \{2, 3\}$) or
infinite output spaces. However, no generalized method for constructing an
optimal mechanism for an arbitrary output size $N$ exists. To fill this gap, we
propose the \textbf{N-output mechanism}, a generalized framework that maps
numerical data to one of $N$ discrete outputs.
  We formulate the mechanism's design as an optimization problem to minimize
estimation variance for any given $N \geq 2$ and develop both numerical and
analytical solutions. This results in a mechanism that is highly accurate and
adaptive, as its design is determined by solving an optimization problem for
any chosen $N$. Furthermore, we extend our framework and existing mechanisms to
the task of distribution estimation. Empirical evaluations show that the
N-output mechanism achieves state-of-the-art accuracy for mean, variance, and
distribution estimation with small communication costs.

TL;DR: The paper proposes CoSPED to test and evaluate data extraction risks in LLMs, introducing innovative components to enhance soft prompt tuning consistency, achieving high extraction rates and effective defense via Rank-One Model Editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address potential security vulnerabilities, especially privacy leakage, and test/evaluate data extraction risks in large language models.

Method: Proposed CoSPED with components like Dynamic Loss, Additive Loss, Common Loss, and Self Consistency Decoding Strategy; extensive experimentation with combinations and comparisons with reference works; evaluation on Pythia model and cross-model comparison; defense via Rank-One Model Editing.

Result: Achieved 65.2% extraction rate at 50-token prefix comparison, 51.7% extraction rate on Pythia model; Rank-One Model Editing reduced extraction rate to 1.6%.

Conclusion: CoSPED has superior extraction rates compared to other works, and analysis of extraction mechanisms informs effective mitigation strategies against soft prompt-based attacks.

Abstract: Large language models have gained widespread attention recently, but their
potential security vulnerabilities, especially privacy leakage, are also
becoming apparent. To test and evaluate for data extraction risks in LLM, we
proposed CoSPED, short for Consistent Soft Prompt targeted data Extraction and
Defense. We introduce several innovative components, including Dynamic Loss,
Additive Loss, Common Loss, and Self Consistency Decoding Strategy, and tested
to enhance the consistency of the soft prompt tuning process. Through extensive
experimentation with various combinations, we achieved an extraction rate of
65.2% at a 50-token prefix comparison. Our comparisons of CoSPED with other
reference works confirm our superior extraction rates. We evaluate CoSPED on
more scenarios, achieving Pythia model extraction rate of 51.7% and introducing
cross-model comparison. Finally, we explore defense through Rank-One Model
Editing and achieve a reduction in the extraction rate to 1.6%, which proves
that our analysis of extraction mechanisms can directly inform effective
mitigation strategies against soft prompt-based attacks.

### [52] [RAG-Pull: Imperceptible Attacks on RAG Systems for Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11195)
*Vasilije Stambolic,Aritra Dhar,Lukas Cavigelli*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper presents RAG-Pull, a new black-box attack that uses hidden UTF characters in queries or external code repos to redirect RAG retrieval to malicious code, causing vulnerabilities like remote code execution and SQL injection, and altering LLM safety alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate vulnerabilities in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems by developing an attack that can redirect retrieval to malicious code, thereby breaking LLM safety alignment.

Method: Developing RAG-Pull, a black-box attack that inserts hidden UTF characters into queries or external code repositories to redirect retrieval toward attacker-controlled snippets; evaluating the success of query perturbations alone, target perturbations alone, and combined query-and-target perturbations.

Result: Query and code perturbations alone can shift retrieval toward attacker-controlled snippets, while combined query-and-target perturbations achieve near-perfect success; retrieved malicious snippets introduce exploitable vulnerabilities (e.g., remote code execution, SQL injection) and alter model safety alignment to prefer unsafe code.

Conclusion: RAG-Pull represents a new class of attacks on LLMs, as its minimal perturbations can redirect RAG retrieval to malicious code, introduce vulnerabilities, and compromise LLM safety alignment.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) increases the reliability and
trustworthiness of the LLM response and reduces hallucination by eliminating
the need for model retraining. It does so by adding external data into the
LLM's context. We develop a new class of black-box attack, RAG-Pull, that
inserts hidden UTF characters into queries or external code repositories,
redirecting retrieval toward malicious code, thereby breaking the models'
safety alignment. We observe that query and code perturbations alone can shift
retrieval toward attacker-controlled snippets, while combined query-and-target
perturbations achieve near-perfect success. Once retrieved, these snippets
introduce exploitable vulnerabilities such as remote code execution and SQL
injection. RAG-Pull's minimal perturbations can alter the model's safety
alignment and increase preference towards unsafe code, therefore opening up a
new class of attacks on LLMs.

### [53] [TraceAegis: Securing LLM-Based Agents via Hierarchical and Behavioral Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11203)
*Jiahao Liu,Bonan Ruan,Xianglin Yang,Zhiwei Lin,Yan Liu,Yang Wang,Tao Wei,Zhenkai Liang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper proposes TraceAegis, a provenance-based analysis framework using agent execution traces to detect anomalies in LLM-based agents, addressing limitations of rule-based methods, and evaluates it on TraceAegis-Bench with strong results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based agents are vulnerable to attacks (e.g., tool poisoning, malicious instructions) leading to serious consequences; existing rule-based mitigation methods require extensive manual effort and leave gaps causing false negatives.

Method: TraceAegis constructs a hierarchical structure to abstract stable execution units for normal behaviors, summarizes them into constrained behavioral rules, and validates execution traces against hierarchical and behavioral constraints.

Result: Experimental results on TraceAegis-Bench (covering healthcare and corporate procurement scenarios with 1,300 benign and 300 abnormal behaviors each) show TraceAegis achieves strong performance, successfully identifying most abnormal behaviors.

Conclusion: TraceAegis, a provenance-based framework leveraging execution traces, effectively detects anomalies in LLM-based agents by validating against hierarchical and behavioral constraints, outperforming rule-based methods.

Abstract: LLM-based agents have demonstrated promising adaptability in real-world
applications. However, these agents remain vulnerable to a wide range of
attacks, such as tool poisoning and malicious instructions, that compromise
their execution flow and can lead to serious consequences like data breaches
and financial loss. Existing studies typically attempt to mitigate such
anomalies by predefining specific rules and enforcing them at runtime to
enhance safety. Yet, designing comprehensive rules is difficult, requiring
extensive manual effort and still leaving gaps that result in false negatives.
As agent systems evolve into complex software systems, we take inspiration from
software system security and propose TraceAegis, a provenance-based analysis
framework that leverages agent execution traces to detect potential anomalies.
In particular, TraceAegis constructs a hierarchical structure to abstract
stable execution units that characterize normal agent behaviors. These units
are then summarized into constrained behavioral rules that specify the
conditions necessary to complete a task. By validating execution traces against
both hierarchical and behavioral constraints, TraceAegis is able to effectively
detect abnormal behaviors. To evaluate the effectiveness of TraceAegis, we
introduce TraceAegis-Bench, a dataset covering two representative scenarios:
healthcare and corporate procurement. Each scenario includes 1,300 benign
behaviors and 300 abnormal behaviors, where the anomalies either violate the
agent's execution order or break the semantic consistency of its execution
sequence. Experimental results demonstrate that TraceAegis achieves strong
performance on TraceAegis-Bench, successfully identifying the majority of
abnormal behaviors.

TL;DR: This note embeds the restricted decoding problem into TCitH and VOLEitH frameworks, achieving competitive signature sizes by using hardness assumptions from CROSS and WAVE, with size reductions over NIST submissions and sizes comparable to the smallest MPCitH-based candidates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the performance of digital signature schemes in the MPCitH framework by leveraging the restricted decoding problem within TCitH and VOLEitH, aiming for competitive signature sizes.

Method: Embedding the restricted decoding problem into TCitH and VOLEitH with structurally simple modeling; instantiating with CROSS's hardness assumption and using ternary full-weight decoding (related to WAVE's hardness assumption).

Result: Reduced signature sizes by more than a factor of two compared to the NIST submission when using CROSS's assumption; obtained signature sizes comparable to the smallest MPCitH-based candidates in the NIST competition with ternary full-weight decoding.

Conclusion: The proposed approach using restricted decoding within TCitH and VOLEitH achieves competitive signature sizes, outperforming some NIST submissions and matching the smallest MPCitH-based candidates.

Abstract: Threshold-Computation-in-the-Head (TCitH) and VOLE-in-the-Head (VOLEitH), two
recent developments of the MPC-in-the-Head (MPCitH) paradigm, have
significantly improved the performance of digital signature schemes in this
framework.
  In this note, we embed the restricted decoding problem within these
frameworks. We propose a structurally simple modeling that achieves competitive
signature sizes. Specifically, by instantiating the restricted decoding problem
with the same hardness assumption underlying CROSS, we reduce sizes by more
than a factor of two compared to the NIST submission. Moreover, we observe that
ternary full-weight decoding, closely related to the hardness assumption
underlying WAVE, is a restricted decoding problem. Using ternary full-weight
decoding, we obtain signature sizes comparable to the smallest MPCitH-based
candidates in the NIST competition.

### [55] [Collaborative Shadows: Distributed Backdoor Attacks in LLM-Based Multi-Agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11246)
*Pengyu Zhu,Lijun Li,Yaxing Lyu,Li Sun,Sen Su,Jing Shao*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper presents the first Distributed Backdoor Attack for LLM-based multi-agent systems (MAS), decomposing the backdoor into distributed attack primitives embedded in MAS tools that activate collectively via specific agent collaboration sequences, with experiments showing over 95% attack success rate without affecting benign tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research on backdoor attacks in LLM-based systems has focused only on single-agent scenarios, ignoring novel attack surfaces introduced by agent collaboration in multi-agent systems (MAS).

Method: The paper introduces the Distributed Backdoor Attack, decomposing the backdoor into multiple distributed attack primitives embedded in MAS tools; these primitives are dormant individually but activate collectively when agents collaborate in a specific sequence to execute targeted attacks. A benchmark for multi-role collaborative tasks and a sandboxed evaluation framework are also introduced.

Result: Extensive experiments show the attack achieves an attack success rate exceeding 95% without degrading performance on benign tasks.

Conclusion: This work exposes novel backdoor attack surfaces exploiting agent collaboration in MAS, highlighting the need to move beyond single-agent protection.

Abstract: LLM-based multi-agent systems (MAS) demonstrate increasing integration into
next-generation applications, but their safety in backdoor attacks remains
largely underexplored. However, existing research has focused exclusively on
single-agent backdoor attacks, overlooking the novel attack surfaces introduced
by agent collaboration in MAS. To bridge this gap, we present the first
Distributed Backdoor Attack tailored to MAS. We decompose the backdoor into
multiple distributed attack primitives that are embedded within MAS tools.
These primitives remain dormant individually but collectively activate only
when agents collaborate in a specific sequence, thereby assembling the full
backdoor to execute targeted attacks such as data exfiltration. To fully assess
this threat, we introduce a benchmark for multi-role collaborative tasks and a
sandboxed framework to evaluate. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
attack achieves an attack success rate exceeding 95% without degrading
performance on benign tasks. This work exposes novel backdoor attack surfaces
that exploit agent collaboration, underscoring the need to move beyond
single-agent protection. Code and benchmark are available at

### [56] [Large Language Models Are Effective Code Watermarkers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11251)
*Rui Xu,Jiawei Chen,Zhaoxia Yin,Cong Kong,Xinpeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper proposes CodeMark-LLM, an LLM-driven watermarking framework for source code attribution, addressing limitations of existing methods in scalability, generality, and robustness by using semantically consistent embedding and differential comparison extraction modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ethical and security concerns from widespread LLM and open-source code use, including unauthorized redistribution, license violations, and malicious misuse; existing watermarking techniques have limited scalability, generality across languages, and robustness against attacks.

Method: CodeMark-LLM, an LLM-driven framework with two core components: (i) Semantically Consistent Embedding module applying functionality-preserving transformations to encode watermark bits, and (ii) Differential Comparison Extraction module identifying transformations by comparing original and watermarked code, leveraging LLM's cross-lingual generalization.

Result: Extensive experiments across diverse programming languages and attack scenarios demonstrate CodeMark-LLM's robustness, effectiveness, and scalability.

Conclusion: CodeMark-LLM addresses limitations of existing source code watermarking techniques, providing a scalable, general, and robust solution for source attribution.

Abstract: The widespread use of large language models (LLMs) and open-source code has
raised ethical and security concerns regarding the distribution and attribution
of source code, including unauthorized redistribution, license violations, and
misuse of code for malicious purposes. Watermarking has emerged as a promising
solution for source attribution, but existing techniques rely heavily on
hand-crafted transformation rules, abstract syntax tree (AST) manipulation, or
task-specific training, limiting their scalability and generality across
languages. Moreover, their robustness against attacks remains limited. To
address these limitations, we propose CodeMark-LLM, an LLM-driven watermarking
framework that embeds watermark into source code without compromising its
semantics or readability. CodeMark-LLM consists of two core components: (i)
Semantically Consistent Embedding module that applies functionality-preserving
transformations to encode watermark bits, and (ii) Differential Comparison
Extraction module that identifies the applied transformations by comparing the
original and watermarked code. Leveraging the cross-lingual generalization
ability of LLM, CodeMark-LLM avoids language-specific engineering and training
pipelines. Extensive experiments across diverse programming languages and
attack scenarios demonstrate its robustness, effectiveness, and scalability.

### [57] [How to Get Actual Privacy and Utility from Privacy Models: the k-Anonymity and Differential Privacy Families](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11299)
*Josep Domingo-Ferrer,David Sánchez*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper examines main privacy models (k-anonymity, differential privacy) and finds they may fail to provide adequate protection or incur poor privacy-utility trade-offs, suggesting semantic reformulation of k-anonymity could offer more robust privacy without losing utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether privacy models fulfill their promise of eliminating the need for costly empirical disclosure risk assessment in privacy-preserving data publishing and statistical disclosure control.

Method: Examination and analysis of the main privacy models (k-anonymity, differential privacy) regarding their protection guarantees, privacy-utility trade-offs, and potential flaws in definitions.

Result: k-anonymity may fail to exclude disclosure with deterministic mechanisms or unconstrained confidential values; differential privacy has unacceptable utility loss for small budgets and meaningless guarantees for large budgets, requiring ex post empirical assessment.

Conclusion: A semantic reformulation of k-anonymity can offer more robust privacy without losing utility compared to traditional syntactic k-anonymity, while improving DP's utility requires relaxing its privacy guarantees.

Abstract: Privacy models were introduced in privacy-preserving data publishing and
statistical disclosure control with the promise to end the need for costly
empirical assessment of disclosure risk. We examine how well this promise is
kept by the main privacy models. We find they may fail to provide adequate
protection guarantees because of problems in their definition or incur
unacceptable trade-offs between privacy protection and utility preservation.
Specifically, k-anonymity may not entirely exclude disclosure if enforced with
deterministic mechanisms or without constraints on the confidential values. On
the other hand, differential privacy (DP) incurs unacceptable utility loss for
small budgets and its privacy guarantee becomes meaningless for large budgets.
In the latter case, an ex post empirical assessment of disclosure risk becomes
necessary, undermining the main appeal of privacy models. Whereas the utility
preservation of DP can only be improved by relaxing its privacy guarantees, we
argue that a semantic reformulation of k-anonymity can offer more robust
privacy without losing utility with respect to traditional syntactic
k-anonymity.

*Junhua Zhou,Quanjun Li,Weixuan Li,Guang Yu,Yihua Shao,Yihang Dong,Mengqian Wang,Zimeng Li,Changwei Gong,Xuhang Chen*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper presents TDADL-IE, a secure image encryption system for digital medical imaging, combining an enhanced chaotic generator with LSTM and 1D-SQCM, a 3D diffusion algorithm, and is versatile with proven effectiveness against security threats.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address insufficient security in existing chaotic system-based image encryption methods for protecting patient data in digital medical imaging (e.g., MRI, CT) used in telemedicine and cloud storage.

Method: TDADL-IE is built on three key elements: an enhanced chaotic generator using LSTM with 1D-Sine Quadratic Chaotic Map (1D-SQCM), a new three-dimensional diffusion algorithm (TDA) applied to encrypt permuted images, and versatility for images of any size.

Result: Experiments confirm TDADL-IE's effectiveness against various security threats.

Conclusion: TDADL-IE is a secure and versatile image encryption system suitable for protecting patient data in digital medical imaging applications.

Abstract: The rise of digital medical imaging, like MRI and CT, demands strong
encryption to protect patient data in telemedicine and cloud storage. Chaotic
systems are popular for image encryption due to their sensitivity and unique
characteristics, but existing methods often lack sufficient security. This
paper presents the Three-dimensional Diffusion Algorithm and Deep Learning
Image Encryption system (TDADL-IE), built on three key elements. First, we
propose an enhanced chaotic generator using an LSTM network with a 1D-Sine
Quadratic Chaotic Map (1D-SQCM) for better pseudorandom sequence generation.
Next, a new three-dimensional diffusion algorithm (TDA) is applied to encrypt
permuted images. TDADL-IE is versatile for images of any size. Experiments
confirm its effectiveness against various security threats. The code is

*Jason Veara,Manav Jain,Kyle Moy,Aanjhan Ranganathan*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes TBRD, a lightweight authentication system for FAA Remote ID messages using TESLA protocol and mobile device TEEs, reducing overhead by 50% vs digital signatures and computation time by 100x, suitable for current standards and UAS capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current FAA Remote ID standards lack specified authentication mechanisms, enabling spoofing, relay, and replay attacks that undermine surveillance and UAS coordination.

Method: TBRD leverages TESLA protocol and mobile device TEEs, with a verification mechanism to build a lightweight, mission-scoped authentication system with low computational and communication overhead.

Result: TBRD provides 50% reduction in authentication overhead vs digital signatures and 100x reduction in computation time, validated via FAA-compliant proof-of-concept and 4-drone swarm simulation under adversarial conditions.

Conclusion: TBRD can integrate into current Remote ID infrastructures for scalable, standards-compliant message authentication for regulatory and operational use cases.

Abstract: Mysterious sightings of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) over U.S. military
facilities, suburban neighborhoods, and commercial airports have intensified
scrutiny of drone activity. To increase accountability, the Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) introduced a Remote ID mandate, requiring unmanned
aircraft to broadcast their location, operator's location, and identity in
real-time. However, current standards leave authentication mechanisms
underspecified, enabling spoofing, relay, and replay attacks that can undermine
surveillance efforts and potentially disrupt UAS-to-UAS coordination in future
deployments. In this paper, we propose TBRD, a practical system for
authenticating Remote ID messages in a manner that aligns with existing
standards and UAS capabilities. TBRD leverages the TESLA protocol and mobile
device TEEs, and introduces a verification mechanism to build a lightweight,
mission-scoped authentication system that is both computationally efficient and
requires a low communication footprint. We evaluate the performance of TBRD
using both an FAA-requirements compatible proof-of-concept implementation for
performance metrics and a simulated 4-drone swarm mission scenario to
demonstrate its security guarantees under adversarial conditions. Our system
provides a 50\% reduction in authentication overhead compared to digital
signatures and a 100x reduction in computation time. Our results demonstrate
that TBRD can be integrated into current Remote ID infrastructures to provide a
scalable, standards-compliant message authentication for both regulatory and
operational use cases.

*Charles Fleming,Ashish Kundu,Ramana Kompella*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper presents an advanced security framework extending TBAC with an LLM as a risk-aware judge for access control in enterprise environments with autonomous AI agents, considering resource risk and model uncertainty to enforce adaptive least privilege.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Managing access control for emergent, novel tasks with no predefined policies due to the proliferation of autonomous AI agents in enterprises.

Method: Extends TBAC using an LLM as an autonomous, risk-aware judge that synthesizes just-in-time policies, computes composite risk scores for tasks, and estimates model uncertainty; high-risk/uncertainty requests trigger stricter controls like human approval.

Result: Enables a more robust and adaptive version of the principle of least privilege by dual consideration of external resource risk and internal model uncertainty.

Conclusion: Paves the way for safer and more trustworthy autonomous systems in enterprise environments.

Abstract: The proliferation of autonomous AI agents within enterprise environments
introduces a critical security challenge: managing access control for emergent,
novel tasks for which no predefined policies exist. This paper introduces an
advanced security framework that extends the Task-Based Access Control (TBAC)
model by using a Large Language Model (LLM) as an autonomous, risk-aware judge.
This model makes access control decisions not only based on an agent's intent
but also by explicitly considering the inherent \textbf{risk associated with
target resources} and the LLM's own \textbf{model uncertainty} in its
decision-making process. When an agent proposes a novel task, the LLM judge
synthesizes a just-in-time policy while also computing a composite risk score
for the task and an uncertainty estimate for its own reasoning. High-risk or
high-uncertainty requests trigger more stringent controls, such as requiring
human approval. This dual consideration of external risk and internal
confidence allows the model to enforce a more robust and adaptive version of
the principle of least privilege, paving the way for safer and more trustworthy
autonomous systems.

### [62] [Bag of Tricks for Subverting Reasoning-based Safety Guardrails](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11570)
*Shuo Chen,Zhen Han,Haokun Chen,Bailan He,Shengyun Si,Jingpei Wu,Philip Torr,Volker Tresp,Jindong Gu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper reveals that reasoning-based safety guardrails for Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are vulnerable to subtle input prompt manipulations, introduces various jailbreak methods across different settings with high success rates, and highlights the need for stronger alignment techniques for open-sourced LRMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the vulnerabilities of reasoning-based safety guardrails for LRMs, which were previously thought to have strong defense against jailbreak attacks.

Method: Uncovering the fragility by adding template tokens, introducing a bag of jailbreak methods spanning white-, gray-, and black-box settings, and conducting evaluations across leading open-source LRMs.

Result: The introduced jailbreak methods achieve alarmingly high attack success rates (e.g., exceeding 90% across 5 benchmarks on gpt-oss series for both local and online models), showing systemic vulnerabilities in open-source LRMs' guardrails.

Conclusion: There is an urgent need for stronger alignment techniques for open-sourced LRMs to prevent malicious misuse.

Abstract: Recent reasoning-based safety guardrails for Large Reasoning Models (LRMs),
such as deliberative alignment, have shown strong defense against jailbreak
attacks. By leveraging LRMs' reasoning ability, these guardrails help the
models to assess the safety of user inputs before generating final responses.
The powerful reasoning ability can analyze the intention of the input query and
will refuse to assist once it detects the harmful intent hidden by the
jailbreak methods. Such guardrails have shown a significant boost in defense,
such as the near-perfect refusal rates on the open-source gpt-oss series.
Unfortunately, we find that these powerful reasoning-based guardrails can be
extremely vulnerable to subtle manipulation of the input prompts, and once
hijacked, can lead to even more harmful results. Specifically, we first uncover
a surprisingly fragile aspect of these guardrails: simply adding a few template
tokens to the input prompt can successfully bypass the seemingly powerful
guardrails and lead to explicit and harmful responses. To explore further, we
introduce a bag of jailbreak methods that subvert the reasoning-based
guardrails. Our attacks span white-, gray-, and black-box settings and range
from effortless template manipulations to fully automated optimization. Along
with the potential for scalable implementation, these methods also achieve
alarmingly high attack success rates (e.g., exceeding 90% across 5 different
benchmarks on gpt-oss series on both local host models and online API
services). Evaluations across various leading open-source LRMs confirm that
these vulnerabilities are systemic, underscoring the urgent need for stronger
alignment techniques for open-sourced LRMs to prevent malicious misuse. Code is

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces PACEbench, a practical AI cyber-exploitation benchmark, and PACEagent, an agent emulating human penetration testers, to evaluate LLMs' cyber offense capabilities; experiments show current LLMs struggle with complex scenarios and can't bypass defenses, indicating no generalized cyber threat yet but providing a benchmark for future development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack real-world complexity and can't accurately assess LLMs' cybersecurity capabilities as LLMs' autonomy increases, necessitating evaluation of their potential to aid in cyber offense.

Method: Introduce PACEbench with four scenarios (single, blended, chained, defense vulnerability exploitations) and propose PACEagent supporting multi-phase reconnaissance, analysis, and exploitation; conduct extensive experiments with seven frontier LLMs.

Result: Current LLMs struggle with complex cyber scenarios and none can bypass defenses.

Conclusion: Current models do not yet pose a generalized cyber offense threat, and the work provides a robust benchmark to guide the trustworthy development of future models.

Abstract: The increasing autonomy of Large Language Models (LLMs) necessitates a
rigorous evaluation of their potential to aid in cyber offense. Existing
benchmarks often lack real-world complexity and are thus unable to accurately
assess LLMs' cybersecurity capabilities. To address this gap, we introduce
PACEbench, a practical AI cyber-exploitation benchmark built on the principles
of realistic vulnerability difficulty, environmental complexity, and cyber
defenses. Specifically, PACEbench comprises four scenarios spanning single,
blended, chained, and defense vulnerability exploitations. To handle these
complex challenges, we propose PACEagent, a novel agent that emulates human
penetration testers by supporting multi-phase reconnaissance, analysis, and
exploitation. Extensive experiments with seven frontier LLMs demonstrate that
current models struggle with complex cyber scenarios, and none can bypass
defenses. These findings suggest that current models do not yet pose a
generalized cyber offense threat. Nonetheless, our work provides a robust
benchmark to guide the trustworthy development of future models.

TL;DR: This survey provides a holistic analysis of LLM-empowered software engineering, organizing 150+ papers into a taxonomy of Solutions (prompt-based, fine-tuning-based, agent-based) and Benchmarks (code generation, translation, repair, etc.), reveals evolution from prompt engineering to complex agentic systems, presents a unified pipeline, connects 50+ benchmarks with solution strategies, and identifies research gaps and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The field lacks a comprehensive understanding of how benchmarks and solutions interconnect in LLM-empowered software engineering, hindering systematic progress and evaluation.

Method: Analyzed 150+ recent papers and organized them into a comprehensive taxonomy spanning two major dimensions: Solutions (prompt-based, fine-tuning-based, agent-based paradigms) and Benchmarks (code generation, translation, repair, and other tasks).

Result: The analysis reveals the field has evolved from simple prompt engineering to complex agentic systems with planning, reasoning, memory, and tool augmentation; a unified pipeline illustrates workflow from task specification to deliverables; 50+ benchmarks are connected with corresponding solution strategies.

Conclusion: This survey serves as a foundational resource, identifying critical research gaps and proposing future directions like multi-agent collaboration, self-evolving code generation, and integrating formal verification with LLM-based methods.

Abstract: The integration of LLMs into software engineering has catalyzed a paradigm
shift from traditional rule-based systems to sophisticated agentic systems
capable of autonomous problem-solving. Despite this transformation, the field
lacks a comprehensive understanding of how benchmarks and solutions
interconnect, hindering systematic progress and evaluation. This survey
presents the first holistic analysis of LLM-empowered software engineering,
bridging the critical gap between evaluation and solution approaches. We
analyze 150+ recent papers and organize them into a comprehensive taxonomy
spanning two major dimensions: (1) Solutions, categorized into prompt-based,
fine-tuning-based, and agent-based paradigms, and (2) Benchmarks, covering code
generation, translation, repair, and other tasks. Our analysis reveals how the
field has evolved from simple prompt engineering to complex agentic systems
incorporating planning and decomposition, reasoning and self-refinement, memory
mechanisms, and tool augmentation. We present a unified pipeline that
illustrates the complete workflow from task specification to final
deliverables, demonstrating how different solution paradigms address varying
complexity levels across software engineering tasks. Unlike existing surveys
that focus on isolated aspects, we provide full-spectrum coverage connecting
50+ benchmarks with their corresponding solution strategies, enabling
researchers to identify optimal approaches for specific evaluation criteria.
Furthermore, we identify critical research gaps and propose actionable future
directions, including multi-agent collaboration frameworks, self-evolving code
generation systems, and integration of formal verification with LLM-based
methods. This survey serves as a foundational resource for researchers and
practitioners seeking to understand, evaluate, and advance LLM-empowered

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces InteractScience, a benchmark to evaluate LLMs' ability to generate interactive scientific demonstrations by combining scientific knowledge with front-end code, using hybrid testing (functional and visual) across five domains, and finds weaknesses in current LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks evaluate either knowledge QA without code grounding or static web code without scientific interactivity, lacking assessment of LLMs' integrated ability to combine accurate scientific knowledge with interactive front-end code for generating scientific demonstrations.

Method: A hybrid framework combining programmatic functional testing (to verify interaction logic) and visually-grounded qualitative testing (to assess rendered outputs against reference snapshots); InteractScience benchmark with questions across five scientific domains, paired with unit tests, reference snapshots, and checklists; evaluation of 30 leading LLMs.

Result: Evaluation of 30 LLMs highlights ongoing weaknesses in integrating domain knowledge with interactive front-end coding.

Conclusion: InteractScience is the first benchmark to automatically measure LLMs' combined capability of scientific knowledge and interactive coding with realistic operations, providing a foundation for advancing reliable scientific demonstration code generation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly capable of generating complete
applications from natural language instructions, creating new opportunities in
science and education. In these domains, interactive scientific demonstrations
are particularly valuable for explaining concepts, supporting new teaching
methods, and presenting research findings. Generating such demonstrations
requires models to combine accurate scientific knowledge with the ability to
implement interactive front-end code that behaves correctly and responds to
user actions. This capability goes beyond the scope of existing benchmarks,
which typically evaluate either knowledge question answering without grounding
in code or static web code generation without scientific interactivity. To
evaluate this integrated ability, we design a hybrid framework that combines
programmatic functional testing to rigorously verify interaction logic with
visually-grounded qualitative testing to assess rendered outputs against
reference snapshots. Building on this framework, we present InteractScience, a
benchmark consisting of a substantial set of carefully designed questions
across five scientific domains, each paired with unit tests, reference
snapshots, and checklists. We evaluate 30 leading open- and closed-source LLMs
and report results that highlight ongoing weaknesses in integrating domain
knowledge with interactive front-end coding. Our work positions InteractScience
as the first benchmark to automatically measure this combined capability with
realistic interactive operations, providing a foundation for advancing reliable
and educationally useful scientific demonstration code generation. All code and

### [66] [OFP-Repair: Repairing Floating-point Errors via Original-Precision Arithmetic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09938)
*Youshuai Tan,Zishuo Ding,Jinfu Chen,Weiyi Shang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper proposes OFP-Repair, a novel method to repair floating-point program errors by distinguishing between original-precision and high-precision repairable errors, achieving significant accuracy improvements on ACESO's dataset and successful repairs in real-world cases including GSL bugs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Floating-point program errors are critical, but developers struggle to distinguish errors fixable with original-precision vs. high-precision arithmetic; existing repair tools either rely on time-consuming high-precision implementations or fix limited errors/produce suboptimal results.

Method: A novel method named OFP-Repair is proposed to address these challenges.

Result: On ACESO's dataset, patches improved by 3, 7, 3, 8 orders of magnitude across four accuracy metrics; in real-world cases, detected all 5 original-precision-repairable errors and fixed 3 (vs. ACESO's 1); repaired 5/15 bugs in a decade-old GSL open bug report, with developers interested in integration.

Conclusion: OFP-Repair demonstrates high practical applicability, with encouraging results showing its effectiveness in repairing floating-point errors.

Abstract: Errors in floating-point programs can lead to severe consequences,
particularly in critical domains such as military, aerospace, and financial
systems, making their repair a crucial research problem. In practice, some
errors can be fixed using original-precision arithmetic, while others require
high-precision computation. Developers often avoid addressing the latter due to
excessive computational resources required. However, they sometimes struggle to
distinguish between these two types of errors, and existing repair tools fail
to assist in this differentiation. Most current repair tools rely on
high-precision implementations, which are time-consuming to develop and demand
specialized expertise. Although a few tools do not require high-precision
programs, they can only fix a limited subset of errors or produce suboptimal
results.
  To address these challenges, we propose a novel method, named OFP-Repair.On
ACESO's dataset, our patches achieve improvements of three, seven, three, and
eight orders of magnitude across four accuracy metrics. In real-world cases,
our method successfully detects all five original-precision-repairable errors
and fixes three, whereas ACESO only repairs one. Notably, these results are
based on verified data and do not fully capture the potential of OFP-Repair. To
further validate our method, we deploy it on a decade-old open bug report from
GNU Scientific Library (GSL), successfully repairing five out of 15 bugs. The
developers have expressed interest in our method and are considering
integrating our tool into their development workflow. We are currently working
on applying our patches to GSL. The results are highly encouraging,
demonstrating the practical applicability of our technique.

*Stefan Pasch*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This study analyzes over 8,000 user reviews of AI development platforms to examine the relationship between MLOps practices and user satisfaction, finding seven of nine practices have a positive link, with organizational context (firm size) affecting practice prevalence but not the satisfaction relationship.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Empirical evidence on whether and how MLOps practices support users in developing and operationalizing AI applications remains limited, despite organizational challenges in AI utilization like scalability, maintenance, and coordination.

Method: Analyzed over 8,000 user reviews of AI development platforms from G2.com using zero-shot classification to measure review sentiment toward nine established MLOps practices.

Result: Seven of the nine MLOps practices show a significant positive relationship with user satisfaction; reviewers from small firms discuss certain practices less frequently, but firm size does not moderate the MLOps-satisfaction link.

Conclusion: Effective MLOps implementation contributes tangible value to AI development, and once applied, MLOps practices are perceived as universally beneficial across organizational settings, though organizational context influences their prevalence and salience.

Abstract: Organizational efforts to utilize and operationalize artificial intelligence
(AI) are often accompanied by substantial challenges, including scalability,
maintenance, and coordination across teams. In response, the concept of Machine
Learning Operations (MLOps) has emerged as a set of best practices that
integrate software engineering principles with the unique demands of managing
the ML lifecycle. Yet, empirical evidence on whether and how these practices
support users in developing and operationalizing AI applications remains
limited. To address this gap, this study analyzes over 8,000 user reviews of AI
development platforms from G2.com. Using zero-shot classification, we measure
review sentiment toward nine established MLOps practices, including continuous
integration and delivery (CI/CD), workflow orchestration, reproducibility,
versioning, collaboration, and monitoring. Seven of the nine practices show a
significant positive relationship with user satisfaction, suggesting that
effective MLOps implementation contributes tangible value to AI development.
However, organizational context also matters: reviewers from small firms
discuss certain MLOps practices less frequently, suggesting that organizational
context influences the prevalence and salience of MLOps, though firm size does
not moderate the MLOps-satisfaction link. This indicates that once applied,
MLOps practices are perceived as universally beneficial across organizational
settings.

TL;DR: SLEAN is a deterministic framework using text-based prompt orchestration to coordinate multiple LLM providers, filtering harmful AI-generated code fixes through a three-phase protocol (independent analysis, cross-critique, arbitration) with minimal deployment requirements and effectiveness shown in evaluating 15 software bugs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the issue that AI-assisted debugging increasingly produces modifications introducing unnecessary complexity, breaking existing functionality, or addressing problems, requiring a way to filter harmful AI-generated code suggestions before production deployment.

Method: SLEAN operates via a three-phase protocol (independent analysis, cross-critique, arbitration) using .txt templates as a prompt bridge between LLMs, with evaluation on 15 software bugs analyzing 69 AI-generated fix propositions.

Result: SLEAN accepted 22 fixes (31.9%, 95% CI 20.9-42.9%) and rejected 47 harmful ones; arbitration reduced code change surface by 83-90% vs raw outputs; minimal Type 2 inputs were more efficient (2.85 vs 3.56 propositions per accepted fix, 35.1% vs 28.1% acceptance, ~20% efficiency gain); AI system agreement had weak correlation with fix quality.

Conclusion: SLEAN's file-driven, provider-agnostic architecture enables deployment without specialized coding expertise, applicable to security auditing, code review, document verification, and other domains needing reliable multi-provider synthesis with end-to-end auditability.

Abstract: We present SLEAN (Simple Lightweight Ensemble Analysis Network), a
deterministic framework for coordinating multiple LLM providers through
text-based prompt orchestration. Unlike complex multi-agent systems requiring
specialized infrastructure, SLEAN operates as a simple prompt bridge between
LLMs using .txt templates, requiring no deep technical knowledge for
deployment. The three-phase protocol formed by independent analysis,
cross-critique, and arbitration, filters harmful AI-generated code suggestions
before production deployment, addressing how AI-assisted debugging increasingly
produces modifications that introduce unnecessary complexity, break existing
functionality, or address problems. Evaluating 15 software bugs, we analyzed 69
AI-generated fix propositions. SLEAN's filtering accepted 22 fixes (31.9%, 95%
CI 20.9-42.9%) while rejecting 47 that would have been harmful if applied
verbatim. The arbitration process reduced code change surface by 83-90%
relative to raw AI outputs, enforcing minimal causal edits over scope-expanding
modifications. Minimal Type 2 inputs proved more efficient than detailed Type 1
inputs, requiring 2.85 versus 3.56 propositions per accepted fix (35.1% versus
28.1% acceptance, about a 20% efficiency gain). Agreement between AI systems
showed weak correlation with fix quality: high convergence (at least 80%)
occurred in 4 of 15 cases and improved acceptance by only 2.4% points;
arbitration appeared only at exactly 10% convergence in 2 of 15 cases, although
low convergence alone did not necessitate arbitration. The file-driven,
provider-agnostic architecture enables deployment without specialized coding
expertise, making it applicable to security auditing, code review, document
verification, and other domains requiring reliable multi-provider synthesis
with end-to-end auditability.

### [69] [OBsmith: Testing JavaScript Obfuscator using LLM-powered sketching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10066)
*Shan Jiang,Chenguang Zhu,Sarfraz Khurshid*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: OBsmith is a novel framework using LLMs and real program sketches to systematically test JavaScript obfuscators for semantic correctness, uncovering 11 unknown bugs that existing fuzzers failed to detect.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations of JavaScript obfuscators focus on resistance to deobfuscation but overlook correctness, with incorrect transformations altering functionality and undermining obfuscation's purpose.

Method: OBsmith uses LLMs to generate program sketches (abstract templates with diverse constructs) instantiated into executable programs, plus extracts sketches from real programs, then tests obfuscators under different configurations.

Result: OBsmith uncovered 11 previously unknown correctness bugs in JavaScript obfuscators, which five state-of-the-art general-purpose JavaScript fuzzers failed to detect under equal program budget.

Conclusion: OBsmith is an important step towards automated testing and quality assurance of obfuscators and other semantic-preserving toolchains, with components contributing to bug detection and highlighting the need for obfuscator-specific metamorphic relations.

Abstract: JavaScript obfuscators are widely deployed to protect intellectual property
and resist reverse engineering, yet their correctness has been largely
overlooked compared to performance and resilience. Existing evaluations
typically measure resistance to deobfuscation, leaving the critical question of
whether obfuscators preserve program semantics unanswered. Incorrect
transformations can silently alter functionality, compromise reliability, and
erode security-undermining the very purpose of obfuscation. To address this
gap, we present OBsmith, a novel framework to systematically test JavaScript
obfuscators using large language models (LLMs). OBsmith leverages LLMs to
generate program sketches abstract templates capturing diverse language
constructs, idioms, and corner cases-which are instantiated into executable
programs and subjected to obfuscation under different configurations. Besides
LLM-powered sketching, OBsmith also employs a second source: automatic
extraction of sketches from real programs. This extraction path enables more
focused testing of project specific features and lets developers inject domain
knowledge into the resulting test cases. OBsmith uncovers 11 previously unknown
correctness bugs. Under an equal program budget, five general purpose
state-of-the-art JavaScript fuzzers (FuzzJIT, Jsfunfuzz, Superion, DIE,
Fuzzilli) failed to detect these issues, highlighting OBsmith's complementary
focus on obfuscation induced misbehavior. An ablation shows that all components
except our generic MRs contribute to at least one bug class; the negative MR
result suggests the need for obfuscator-specific metamorphic relations. Our
results also seed discussion on how to balance obfuscation presets and
performance cost. We envision OBsmith as an important step towards automated
testing and quality assurance of obfuscators and other semantic-preserving
toolchains.

### [70] [A Mathematics-Guided Approach to Floating-Point Error Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10081)
*Youshuai Tan,Zhanwei Zhang,Zishuo Ding,Lianyu Zheng,Jinfu Chen,Weiyi Shang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes MGDE, a novel method using the Newton-Raphson method with quadratic convergence, to detect error-inducing inputs in floating-point programs, addressing high computational cost and limited long-range convergence of existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for detecting error-inducing inputs in floating-point programs have high computational cost (relying on time-consuming high-precision program evaluations) and limited long-range convergence (inefficient search).

Method: MGDE, a method based on mathematical guidance using the Newton-Raphson method with quadratic convergence properties.

Result: MGDE detects 89 bugs across 44 single-input programs (vs. FPCC's 48 bugs/29 programs), takes 1/6.4096 the time of FPCC; for multi-input programs, it identifies 9 bugs with 0.6443s average time per program (FPCC detects none with 100s average time).

Conclusion: MGDE effectively addresses the limitations of existing methods, achieving higher efficiency and better detection performance in both single and multi-input floating-point programs.

Abstract: Floating-point program errors can lead to severe consequences, particularly
in critical domains such as military applications. Only a small subset of
inputs may induce substantial floating-point errors, prompting researchers to
develop methods for identifying these error-inducing inputs. Although existing
approaches have achieved some success, they still suffer from two major
limitations: (1) High computational cost: The evaluation of error magnitude for
candidate inputs relies on high-precision programs, which are prohibitively
time-consuming. (2) Limited long-range convergence capability: Current methods
exhibit inefficiency in search, making the process akin to finding a needle in
a haystack.
  To address these two limitations, we propose a novel method, named MGDE, to
detect error-inducing inputs based on mathematical guidance. By employing the
Newton-Raphson method, which exhibits quadratic convergence properties, we
achieve highly effective and efficient results. Since the goal of identifying
error-inducing inputs is to uncover the underlying bugs, we use the number of
bugs detected in floating-point programs as the primary evaluation metric in
our experiments. As FPCC represents the most effective state-of-the-art
approach to date, we use it as the baseline for comparison. The dataset of FPCC
consists of 88 single-input floating-point programs. FPCC is able to detect 48
bugs across 29 programs, whereas our method successfully identifies 89 bugs
across 44 programs. Moreover, FPCC takes 6.4096 times as long as our proposed
method. We also deploy our method to multi-input programs, identifying a total
of nine bugs with an average detection time of 0.6443 seconds per program. In
contrast, FPCC fails to detect any bugs while requiring an average computation
time of 100 seconds per program.

### [71] [IntrinTrans: LLM-based Intrinsic Code Translator for RISC-V Vector](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10119)
*Liutong Han,Zhiyuan Tan,Hongbin Zhang,Pengcheng Wang,Chu Kang,Mingjie Xing,Yanjun Wu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: IntrinTrans, a LLM-based multi-agent approach with compile-and-test feedback, automates translation of vectorized intrinsic code to RISC-V Vector (RVV) intrinsics and optimizes using register-usage from liveness analysis, outperforming open-source community implementations in some cases by up to 5.93x.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to translate existing vectorized intrinsic code (e.g., Arm Neon) to RISC-V Vector (RVV) intrinsics due to growing RVV ecosystem demand, addressing limitations of manual rewriting (time-consuming, error-prone) and rule-based methods (low success rate, poor performance from underutilizing RVV features).

Method: IntrinTrans, a LLM-based multi-agent approach that uses compile-and-test feedback for automatic cross-architecture intrinsic translation and optimizes generated RVV intrinsics via register-usage information from liveness analysis.

Result: Experiments on 34 vectorized algorithm cases (Arm Neon to RVV) show advanced LLMs produce semantically correct RVV intrinsics in most cases within limited iterations, with some cases achieving up to 5.93x performance of open-source community native implementations.

Conclusion: IntrinTrans effectively automates and optimizes cross-architecture intrinsic translation to RVV, addressing manual and rule-based method limitations and improving performance.

Abstract: The use of intrinsic functions to exploit hardware-specific capabilities is
an important approach for optimizing library performance. Many mainstream
libraries implement a large number of vectorized algorithms on Arm or x86 SIMD
intrinsic functions. With the rapid expansion of the RISC-V hardware-software
ecosystem, there is a growing demand for support of the RISC-V Vector (RVV)
extension. Translating existing vectorized intrinsic code onto RVV intrinsics
is a practical and effective approach. However, current cross-architecture
translation largely relies on manual rewriting, which is time-consuming and
error-prone. Furthermore, while some rule-based methods can reduce the need for
manual intervention, their translation success rate is limited by incomplete
rule coverage and syntactic constraints, and the performance suffers from
inadequate utilization of RVV-specific features. We present IntrinTrans, a
LLM-based multi-agent approach that utilizes compile-and-test feedback to
translate intrinsic code across architectures automatically, and further
optimizes the generated RVV intrinsics using register-usage information derived
from liveness analysis. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we
collected 34 vectorized algorithm cases from open-source libraries. Each case
includes an Arm Neon intrinsics implementation and a RVV intrinsics
implementation contributed by the open-source community, together with
correctness and performance tests. Our experiments show that advanced LLMs
produce semantically correct RISC-V Vector intrinsics in most cases within a
limited number of iterations, and in some cases achieve up to 5.93x the
performance of the native implementation from the open-source community.

*Mengyao Zhao,Kaixuan Li,Lyuye Zhang,Wenjing Dang,Chenggong Ding,Sen Chen,Zheli Liu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper presents the first empirical study on using LLMs (GPT-4o and DeepSeek-R1) to generate PoC exploits for web app vulnerabilities by leveraging public CVE info, evaluating across three disclosure stages, finding success rates of 8%-34% with public data, 17%-20% improvement with code context, and 68%-72% with adaptive reasoning, with 23 PoCs accepted by NVD and Exploit DB.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if LLMs can effectively use publicly disclosed CVE information to automatically generate valid Proof-of-Concept (PoC) exploits for web application vulnerabilities, given the growing availability of such info and the central role of PoC generation in vulnerability reproduction, comprehension, and mitigation.

Method: An empirical study evaluating GPT-4o and DeepSeek-R1 on 100 real-world, reproducible CVEs across three disclosure stages: (1) newly disclosed with only descriptions, (2) 1-day with patches, (3) N-day with full contextual code; analyzing success rates with public data, code context (function-level vs file-level), and adaptive reasoning strategies.

Result: LLMs generated working PoCs in 8%-34% of cases using only public data (DeepSeek-R1 outperforming GPT-4o); supplementing code context improved success rates by 17%-20% (function-level 9%-13% better than file-level); integrating adaptive reasoning strategies raised success rates to 68%-72%; 23 new PoCs accepted by NVD and Exploit DB.

Conclusion: LLMs could reshape vulnerability exploitation dynamics by effectively generating PoCs using publicly disclosed CVE information, with performance improving via code context and adaptive reasoning strategies.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have brought remarkable
progress in code understanding and reasoning, creating new opportunities and
raising new concerns for software security. Among many downstream tasks,
generating Proof-of-Concept (PoC) exploits plays a central role in
vulnerability reproduction, comprehension, and mitigation. While previous
research has focused primarily on zero-day exploitation, the growing
availability of rich public information accompanying disclosed CVEs leads to a
natural question: can LLMs effectively use this information to automatically
generate valid PoCs? In this paper, we present the first empirical study of
LLM-based PoC generation for web application vulnerabilities, focusing on the
practical feasibility of leveraging publicly disclosed information. We evaluate
GPT-4o and DeepSeek-R1 on 100 real-world and reproducible CVEs across three
stages of vulnerability disclosure: (1) newly disclosed vulnerabilities with
only descriptions, (2) 1-day vulnerabilities with patches, and (3) N-day
vulnerabilities with full contextual code. Our results show that LLMs can
automatically generate working PoCs in 8%-34% of cases using only public data,
with DeepSeek-R1 consistently outperforming GPT-4o. Further analysis shows that
supplementing code context improves success rates by 17%-20%, with
function-level providing 9%-13% improvement than file-level ones. Further
integrating adaptive reasoning strategies to prompt refinement significantly
improves success rates to 68%-72%. Our findings suggest that LLMs could reshape
vulnerability exploitation dynamics. To date, 23 newly generated PoCs have been
accepted by NVD and Exploit DB.

### [73] [LLMs are All You Need? Improving Fuzz Testing for MOJO with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10179)
*Linghan Huang,Peizhou Zhao,Huaming Chen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper proposes MOJOFuzzer, the first adaptive LLM-based fuzzing framework for zero-shot testing of emerging languages like MOJO, addressing the lack of testing frameworks and corpus by integrating multi-phase input elimination and dynamic prompt adaptation, with experiments showing improved test validity, coverage, and bug detection, uncovering 13 unknown bugs in MOJO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MOJO, a new high-performance AI programming language, lacks comprehensive testing frameworks and sufficient corpus for LLM-based testing, leading to LLM-generated code that is syntactically valid but semantically incorrect, reducing fuzz testing effectiveness.

Method: MOJOFuzzer integrates a multi-phase framework to systematically eliminate low-quality generated inputs before execution and dynamically adapts LLM prompts based on runtime feedback for test case mutation, enabling iterative learning.

Result: MOJOFuzzer significantly enhances test validity, API coverage, and bug detection performance, outperforming traditional and state-of-the-art LLM-based fuzzing approaches; it uncovered 13 previously unknown bugs in MOJO during large-scale evaluation.

Conclusion: This study advances LLM-driven software testing and establishes a foundational methodology for leveraging LLMs in testing emerging programming languages.

Abstract: The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized
software testing, particularly fuzz testing, by automating the generation of
diverse and effective test inputs. This advancement holds great promise for
improving software reliability. Meanwhile, the introduction of MOJO, a
high-performance AI programming language blending Python's usability with the
efficiency of C and C++, presents new opportunities to enhance AI model
scalability and programmability. However, as a new language, MOJO lacks
comprehensive testing frameworks and a sufficient corpus for LLM-based testing,
which exacerbates model hallucination. In this case, LLMs will generate
syntactically valid but semantically incorrect code, significantly reducing the
effectiveness of fuzz testing. To address this challenge, we propose
MOJOFuzzer, the first adaptive LLM-based fuzzing framework designed for
zero-shot learning environments of emerging programming languages. MOJOFuzzer
integrates a mutil-phase framework that systematically eliminates low-quality
generated inputs before execution, significantly improving test case validity.
Furthermore, MOJOFuzzer dynamically adapts LLM prompts based on runtime
feedback for test case mutation, enabling an iterative learning process that
continuously enhances fuzzing efficiency and bug detection performance. Our
experimental results demonstrate that MOJOFuzzer significantly enhances test
validity, API coverage, and bug detection performance, outperforming
traditional fuzz testing and state-of-the-art LLM-based fuzzing approaches.
Using MOJOFuzzer, we have conducted a first large-scale fuzz testing evaluation
of MOJO, uncorvering 13 previous unknown bugs. This study not only advances the
field of LLM-driven software testing but also establishes a foundational
methodology for leveraging LLMs in the testing of emerging programming
languages.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: A production system for grounded, PR-native code review is presented, addressing low adoption in compliance-heavy settings by pairing static analysis with AST-guided context extraction and a single-GPU serving stack, achieving sub-minute first feedback, competitive violation reduction, and lower rates vs larger models, with decoupled architecture and positive user survey signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated code review adoption lags in compliance-heavy settings due to static analyzers' high-volume, low-rationale outputs and naive LLM use risking hallucination and cost overhead.

Method: The system pairs static-analysis findings with AST-guided context extraction and a single-GPU, on-demand serving stack (quantized open-weight model, multi-tier caching) to deliver concise explanations and remediation guidance.

Result: Evaluated on safety-oriented C/C++ standards, it achieves sub-minute median first-feedback (offline p50 build+LLM 59.8s), competitive violation reduction, lower violation rates vs larger proprietary models, and a small survey (n=8) shows reduced triage effort, moderate grounding, and fewer human review iterations.

Conclusion: The decoupled architecture allows independent adoption of grounding/prompting or serving layers; operational lessons highlight reproducibility, auditability, and pathways to broader standards and assisted patching.

Abstract: Automated code review adoption lags in compliance-heavy settings, where

reduced triage effort and moderate perceived grounding, with participants
reporting fewer human review iterations. We outline operational lessons and

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper investigates the effects of drift-based retraining versus periodic retraining for capacity forecasting models in time series, finding drift-based retraining is cost-effective with comparable accuracy in most cases, but periodic retraining is better for rapidly changing data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Continuously retraining forecasting models for capacity management is expensive and hard to scale, while retraining only when data changes is computationally efficient but its accuracy impact needs investigation.

Method: Investigate the effects of retraining capacity forecasting models for time series based on detected data changes compared to periodic retraining.

Result: Drift-based retraining achieves comparable forecasting accuracy to periodic retraining in most cases; periodic retraining is preferred for rapidly changing data to maximize accuracy.

Conclusion: Drift-based retraining is a cost-effective strategy for capacity forecasting, offering actionable insights to reduce retraining overhead while maintaining performance, though periodic retraining is better for rapidly changing data.

Abstract: Capacity management is critical for software organizations to allocate
resources effectively and meet operational demands. An important step in
capacity management is predicting future resource needs often relies on
data-driven analytics and machine learning (ML) forecasting models, which
require frequent retraining to stay relevant as data evolves. Continuously
retraining the forecasting models can be expensive and difficult to scale,
posing a challenge for engineering teams tasked with balancing accuracy and
efficiency. Retraining only when the data changes appears to be a more
computationally efficient alternative, but its impact on accuracy requires
further investigation. In this work, we investigate the effects of retraining
capacity forecasting models for time series based on detected changes in the
data compared to periodic retraining. Our results show that drift-based
retraining achieves comparable forecasting accuracy to periodic retraining in
most cases, making it a cost-effective strategy. However, in cases where data
is changing rapidly, periodic retraining is still preferred to maximize the
forecasting accuracy. These findings offer actionable insights for software
teams to enhance forecasting systems, reducing retraining overhead while
maintaining robust performance.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper presents a hybrid framework for software vulnerability detection by viewing programs as heterogeneous graphs and combining graph representations with lightweight local LLMs, achieving 93.57% accuracy on Java vulnerability detection, with improved interpretability through salient subgraph extraction and natural language explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static and dynamic analyses often overlook structural dependencies that shape insecure behaviors in software, leading to persistent vulnerability risks.

Method: The hybrid framework captures control- and data-flow relations of programs as heterogeneous graphs, combines these graph representations with lightweight (<4B) local LLMs, uniting topological features with semantic reasoning while avoiding the cost and privacy concerns of large cloud models.

Result: Evaluated on Java vulnerability detection (binary classification), the method achieves 93.57% accuracy, which is an 8.36% gain over Graph Attention Network-based embeddings and 17.81% over pretrained LLM baselines such as Qwen2.5 Coder 3B; it also extracts salient subgraphs and generates natural language explanations.

Conclusion: These results pave the way for scalable, explainable, and locally deployable tools that can shift vulnerability analysis from purely syntactic checks to deeper structural and semantic insights, facilitating broader adoption in real-world secure software development.

Abstract: Software vulnerabilities remain a persistent risk, yet static and dynamic
analyses often overlook structural dependencies that shape insecure behaviors.
Viewing programs as heterogeneous graphs, we capture control- and data-flow

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the prosperous development and adoption of MASs for automated code generation, their robustness remains under-explored, raising critical concerns for real-world deployment.

Method: A fuzzing pipeline incorporating semantic-preserving mutation operators and a novel fitness function was designed to assess mainstream MASs across multiple datasets and LLMs.

Result: Mainstream MASs fail to solve 7.9%-83.3% of problems they initially resolved after applying semantic-preserving mutations; the repairing method solves 40.0%-88.9% of identified failures.

Conclusion: The work uncovers critical robustness flaws in MASs due to miscommunications between planning and coding agents, provides effective mitigation strategies, and contributes insights for developing more reliable MASs for code generation.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MASs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for automated
code generation, demonstrating impressive performance on established benchmarks
by decomposing complex coding tasks across specialized agents with different
roles. Despite their prosperous development and adoption, their robustness
remains pressingly under-explored, raising critical concerns for real-world
deployment. This paper presents the first comprehensive study examining the
robustness of MASs for code generation through a fuzzing-based testing
approach. By designing a fuzzing pipeline incorporating semantic-preserving
mutation operators and a novel fitness function, we assess mainstream MASs
across multiple datasets and LLMs. Our findings reveal substantial robustness
flaws of various popular MASs: they fail to solve 7.9%-83.3% of problems they
initially resolved successfully after applying the semantic-preserving
mutations. Through comprehensive failure analysis, we identify a common yet
largely overlooked cause of the robustness issue: miscommunications between
planning and coding agents, where plans lack sufficient detail and coding
agents misinterpret intricate logic, aligning with the challenges inherent in a
multi-stage information transformation process. Accordingly, we also propose a
repairing method that encompasses multi-prompt generation and introduces a new
monitor agent to address this issue. Evaluation shows that our repairing method
effectively enhances the robustness of MASs by solving 40.0%-88.9% of
identified failures. Our work uncovers critical robustness flaws in MASs and
provides effective mitigation strategies, contributing essential insights for
developing more reliable MASs for code generation.

TL;DR: This study investigates how novice software developers interact with generative AI for unit test engineering, examining their strategies, reliance, perceived benefits and challenges, and the impact on test effectiveness and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address concerns about how generative AI alters novice developers' roles in software engineering workflows, particularly regarding control, output quality, and learning in unit test engineering.

Method: An observational study with 12 undergraduate students who used generative AI for unit testing tasks, analyzing their interaction strategies and prompting styles.

Result: Identified four interaction strategies (based on origin of test idea/implementation) and prompting styles (one-shot/iterative); students reported benefits (time-saving, reduced cognitive load, test ideation support) and drawbacks (diminished trust, quality concerns, lack of ownership); strategy and prompting styles influenced workflow dynamics but not test effectiveness/quality (mutation score, test smells).

Conclusion: While generative AI offers benefits for novice developers in unit test engineering, challenges like trust and ownership exist, and interaction strategies/prompting styles affect workflow dynamics but not test effectiveness or quality.

Abstract: The integration of generative AI tools like ChatGPT into software engineering
workflows opens up new opportunities to boost productivity in tasks such as
unit test engineering. However, these AI-assisted workflows can also
significantly alter the developer's role, raising concerns about control,
output quality, and learning, particularly for novice developers. This study
investigates how novice software developers with foundational knowledge in
software testing interact with generative AI for engineering unit tests. Our
goal is to examine the strategies they use, how heavily they rely on generative
AI, and the benefits and challenges they perceive when using generative
AI-assisted approaches for test engineering. We conducted an observational
study involving 12 undergraduate students who worked with generative AI for
unit testing tasks. We identified four interaction strategies, defined by
whether the test idea or the test implementation originated from generative AI
or the participant. Additionally, we singled out prompting styles that focused
on one-shot or iterative test generation, which often aligned with the broader
interaction strategy. Students reported benefits including time-saving, reduced
cognitive load, and support for test ideation, but also noted drawbacks such as
diminished trust, test quality concerns, and lack of ownership. While strategy
and prompting styles influenced workflow dynamics, they did not significantly
affect test effectiveness or test code quality as measured by mutation score or
test smells.

Motivation: To understand the state of GenAI transformations in software project management as discussed by practitioners.

Method: A grey literature review using 47 publicly available practitioner sources including blogs, articles, and industry reports.

Result: Software project managers primarily view GenAI as an 'assistant', 'copilot', or 'friend' (not a replacement), with support in automating routine tasks, predictive analytics, communication/collaboration, and agile practices for project success; concerns include hallucinations, ethics/privacy, and lack of emotional intelligence/human judgment.

Conclusion: Presents upskilling requirements for software project managers in the GenAI era mapped to PMI's talent triangle and shares key recommendations for practitioners and researchers.

Abstract: Software practitioners are discussing GenAI transformations in software
project management openly and widely. To understand the state of affairs, we
performed a grey literature review using 47 publicly available practitioner
sources including blogs, articles, and industry reports. We found that software
project managers primarily perceive GenAI as an "assistant", "copilot", or
"friend" rather than as a "PM replacement", with support of GenAI in automating
routine tasks, predictive analytics, communication and collaboration, and in
agile practices leading to project success. Practitioners emphasize responsible
GenAI usage given concerns such as hallucinations, ethics and privacy, and lack
of emotional intelligence and human judgment. We present upskilling
requirements for software project managers in the GenAI era mapped to the
Project Management Institute's talent triangle. We share key recommendations
for both practitioners and researchers.

### [83] [Project-Level C-to-Rust Translation via Synergistic Integration of Knowledge Graphs and Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10956)
*Zhiqiang Yuan,Wenjun Mao,Zhuo Chen,Xiyue Shang,Chong Wang,Yiling Lou,Xin Peng*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel C-Rust Pointer Knowledge Graph (KG) and a tool (ourtool) to improve project-level C-to-Rust translation by providing LLMs with global pointer semantics, reducing unsafe usages by 99.9% and increasing functional correctness by 29.3% compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based methods for project-level C-to-Rust translation struggle with translating pointers due to the bottom-up, unit-by-unit paradigm lacking a global perspective on pointer usage.

Method: The method involves creating a C-Rust Pointer Knowledge Graph (KG) that enriches code-dependency graphs with pointer-usage information (global behaviors like points-to flows and struct usage mapping) and Rust-oriented annotations (ownership, mutability, nullability, lifetime), then synthesizing this KG with LLMs to guide translation.

Result: Ourtool reduces unsafe usages in translated Rust by 99.9% compared to rule-based and traditional LLM-based methods, and achieves an average 29.3% higher functional correctness than fuzzing-enhanced LLM methods.

Conclusion: The proposed C-Rust Pointer Knowledge Graph and ourtool effectively address the pointer translation issue in project-level C-to-Rust translation, generating safer and more correct Rust code.

Abstract: Translating C code into safe Rust is an effective way to ensure its memory
safety. Compared to rule-based translation which produces Rust code that
remains largely unsafe, LLM-based methods can generate more idiomatic and safer
Rust code because LLMs have been trained on vast amount of human-written
idiomatic code. Although promising, existing LLM-based methods still struggle
with project-level C-to-Rust translation. They typically partition a C project
into smaller units (\eg{} functions) based on call graphs and translate them
bottom-up to resolve program dependencies. However, this bottom-up,
unit-by-unit paradigm often fails to translate pointers due to the lack of a
global perspective on their usage. To address this problem, we propose a novel
C-Rust Pointer Knowledge Graph (KG) that enriches a code-dependency graph with
two types of pointer semantics: (i) pointer-usage information which record
global behaviors such as points-to flows and map lower-level struct usage to
higher-level units; and (ii) Rust-oriented annotations which encode ownership,
mutability, nullability, and lifetime. Synthesizing the \kg{} with LLMs, we
further propose \ourtool{}, which implements a project-level C-to-Rust
translation technique. In \ourtool{}, the \kg{} provides LLMs with
comprehensive pointer semantics from a global perspective, thus guiding LLMs
towards generating safe and idiomatic Rust code from a given C project. Our
experiments show that \ourtool{} reduces unsafe usages in translated Rust by
99.9\% compared to both rule-based translation and traditional LLM-based
rewriting, while achieving an average 29.3\% higher functional correctness than
those fuzzing-enhanced LLM methods.

*Yifeng Zhu,Xianlin Zhao,Xutian Li,Yanzhen Zou,Haizhuo Yuan,Yue Wang,Bing Xie*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: RepoSummary is a feature-oriented code repository summarization approach that automatically generates documentation and establishes accurate traceability links from features to code elements, outperforming HGEN in feature coverage, traceability, and documentation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing repository summarization techniques focus on directory tree-based code summarization, insufficient for tracing high-level features to collaborative methods.

Method: Propose RepoSummary, a feature-oriented approach that automatically generates repository documentation and establishes accurate traceability links from functional features to code elements.

Result: Comprehensive experiments show RepoSummary outperforms HGEN: increases completely covered features in manual documentation from 61.2% to 71.1%, improves file-level traceability recall from 29.9% to 53.0%, and generates more consistent, understandable, and better formatted documentation.

Conclusion: RepoSummary effectively addresses limitations of existing techniques, achieving higher feature coverage, more accurate traceability, and better documentation quality.

Abstract: Repository summarization is a crucial research question in development and
maintenance for software engineering. Existing repository summarization
techniques primarily focus on summarizing code according to the directory tree,
which is insufficient for tracing high-level features to the methods that
collaboratively implement them. To address these limitations, we propose
RepoSummary, a feature-oriented code repository summarization approach that
simultaneously generates repository documentation automatically. Furthermore,
it establishes more accurate traceability links from functional features to the
corresponding code elements, enabling developers to rapidly locate relevant
methods and files during code comprehension and maintenance. Comprehensive
experiments against the state-of-the-art baseline (HGEN) demonstrate that
RepoSummary achieves higher feature coverage and more accurate traceability. On
average, it increases the rate of completely covered features in manual
documentation from 61.2% to 71.1%, improves file-level traceability recall from
29.9% to 53.0%, and generates documentation that is more conceptually
consistent, easier to understand, and better formatted than that produced by
existing approaches.

*Jian Wang,Xiaofei Xie,Qiang Hu,Shangqing Liu,Jiongchi Yu,Jiaolong Klong,Yi Li*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces Defects4C, a comprehensive benchmark for C/C++ program repair, addressing the gap in C/C++ APR research due to lack of high-quality benchmarks, and evaluates 24 LLMs using it to provide insights into LLM-based APR strengths and limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the significant gap in research on C/C++ program repair, which exists despite C/C++'s widespread use and vulnerability prevalence, primarily due to the lack of high-quality, open-source benchmarks tailored for C/C++.

Method: The method involves constructing Defects4C from real-world C/C++ repositories, including 9M bug-relevant commits, 248 high-quality buggy functions, 102 vulnerable functions paired with test cases, and conducting an empirical study evaluating 24 state-of-the-art LLMs on this benchmark.

Result: The result is the introduction of Defects4C, a comprehensive and executable C/C++ APR benchmark, and findings from evaluating 24 LLMs that offer insights into the strengths and limitations of current LLM-based APR techniques for C/C++.

Conclusion: Defects4C fills the gap in C/C++ APR benchmarks, enabling rigorous evaluation and retraining of repair techniques, and the empirical study highlights the need for more robust methods, emphasizing Defects4C's critical role in advancing future C/C++ APR research.

Abstract: Automated Program Repair (APR) plays a critical role in enhancing the quality
and reliability of software systems. While substantial progress has been made
in Java-based APR, largely facilitated by benchmarks like Defects4J, there
remains a significant gap in research on C/C++ program repair, despite the
widespread use of C/C++ and the prevalence of associated vulnerabilities. This
gap is primarily due to the lack of high-quality, open-source benchmarks
tailored for C/C++.
  To address this issue, we introduce Defects4C, a comprehensive and executable
benchmark specifically designed for C/C++ program repair. Our dataset is
constructed from real-world C/C++ repositories and includes a large collection
of bug-relevant commits (9M in total), 248 high-quality buggy functions, and
102 vulnerable functions, all paired with test cases for reproduction. These
resources enable rigorous evaluation of repair techniques and support the
retraining of learning-based approaches for enhanced performance.
  Using Defects4C, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study evaluating the
effectiveness of 24 state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) in repairing
C/C++ faults. Our findings offer valuable insights into the strengths and
limitations of current LLM-based APR techniques in this domain, highlighting
both the need for more robust methods and the critical role of Defects4C in
advancing future research

### [86] [DebugTA: An LLM-Based Agent for Simplifying Debugging and Teaching in Programming Education](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11076)
*Lingyue Fu,Haowei Yuan,Datong Chen,Xinyi Dai,Qingyao Li,Weinan Zhang,Weiwen Liu,Yong Yu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper proposes DebugTA, an LLM-based debugging and teaching agent with specialized tools to address challenges in programming education's Debugging and Teaching (DT) tasks, improving effectiveness and reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for DT tasks face challenges: complexity/heterogeneity of inputs elevate LLM reasoning challenges, and underutilization of standard code limits LLM potential.

Method: DebugTA uses specialized tools (standard code retrieval, variable substitution for reference code alignment, external compiler for real-time analysis), decomposes tasks into sequential LLM interactions with distinct tools, and aligns standard code with erroneous code to focus on logic errors.

Result: Experimental results on three real-world code datasets show DebugTA consistently improves teaching effectiveness and significantly reduces computational costs.

Conclusion: DebugTA addresses DT task challenges by simplifying reasoning through tool-aided decomposition and leveraging standard code, enhancing LLM performance in generating modification suggestions.

Abstract: In programming education, Debugging and Teaching (DT) task is a common
scenario where students receive assistance in correcting their erroneous code.
The task involves multiple inputs, including erroneous code, error messages,
reference solutions, and the question description, with the goal of generating
modification suggestions to the erroneous code. However, two key challenges
hinder the effectiveness of existing approaches. Firstly, the complexity and
heterogeneity of inputs inherent in DT tasks significantly elevate the
reasoning challenges faced by LLMs. Second, existing approaches often fail to
fully leverage the availability of standard code in DT tasks, forcing models to
rely solely on complex multi-step reasoning, which limits the potential of LLMs
in addressing DT tasks effectively. To address these challenges, we propose
DebugTA, a novel LLM-based debugging and teaching agent with specialized tools
for standard code retrieval, variable substitution to align reference code, and
an external compiler for real-time code analysis. Guided by explicit
pedagogical and debugging principles, DebugTA acts as an agent that decomposes
a complex task into sequential LLM interactions, each utilizing distinct tools
for specific subtasks, thereby simplifying the logical reasoning at each step
and reducing overall reasoning complexity. Furthermore, DebugTA utilizes tool
calls to align the standard code with the erroneous code as much as possible,
allowing the LLM to focus on logic errors within the erroneous code and
improving the accuracy of the generated suggestions. To rigorously assess the
quality of modification suggestions, we introduce a student simulator-teacher
interaction paradigm. Experimental results on three real-world code datasets
demonstrate that DebugTA consistently improves teaching effectiveness while
significantly reducing computational costs.

TL;DR: This paper presents the first large-scale analysis of FMware development across cloud-based platforms and open-source repositories, investigating application domains, developer challenges, and effort-demanding issues, with findings revealing focus areas and technical pain points to guide FMware tool and workflow improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation Models (FMs) are transforming software engineering through FMware, but their design, implementation, and evolution present significant new challenges across cloud-based and on-premise platforms, which traditional software development goals, processes, and tools often diverge from.

Method: The study empirically investigates the FMware ecosystem through three focus areas: (1) most common application domains, (2) key developer challenges, (3) types of issues demanding greatest effort. Data is drawn from GitHub repositories and leading FMware platforms (HuggingFace, GPTStore, Ora, Poe).

Result: Findings show strong focus on education, content creation, and business strategy; persistent technical challenges in memory management, dependency handling, and tokenizer configuration. On GitHub, bug reports and core functionality issues are most frequent, while code review, similarity search, and prompt template design are most time-consuming to resolve.

Conclusion: By uncovering developer practices and pain points, the study points to opportunities to improve FMware tools, workflows, and community support, providing actionable insights to guide the future of FMware development.

Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs), such as OpenAI's GPT, are fundamentally transforming
the practice of software engineering by enabling the development of
\emph{FMware} -- applications and infrastructures built around these models.
FMware systems now support tasks such as code generation, natural-language
interaction, knowledge integration, and multi-modal content creation,
underscoring their disruptive impact on current software engineering workflows.
However, the design, implementation, and evolution of FMware present
significant new challenges, particularly across cloud-based and on-premise
platforms where goals, processes, and tools often diverge from those of
traditional software development.
  To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale analysis of FMware
development across both cloud-based platforms and open-source repositories. We
empirically investigate the FMware ecosystem through three focus areas: (1) the
most common application domains of FMware, (2) the key challenges developers
encounter, and (3) the types of issues that demand the greatest effort to
resolve. Our analysis draws on data from GitHub repositories and from leading
FMware platforms, including HuggingFace, GPTStore, Ora, and Poe. Our findings
reveal a strong focus on education, content creation, and business strategy,
alongside persistent technical challenges in memory management, dependency
handling, and tokenizer configuration. On GitHub, bug reports and core
functionality issues are the most frequently reported problems, while code
review, similarity search, and prompt template design are the most
time-consuming to resolve.
  By uncovering developer practices and pain points, this study points to
opportunities to improve FMware tools, workflows, and community support, and
provides actionable insights to help guide the future of FMware development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Kieker currently only instruments a smaller selection of languages/technologies, while OpenTelemetry provides reference implementations for more languages (including C# and JavaScript not supported by Kieker).

Method: Transform OpenTelemetry tracing data into the Kieker framework.

Result: It becomes possible to create call trees from OpenTelemetry instrumentations.

Conclusion: The approach's usability is demonstrated by visualizing trace data of the Astronomy Shop, an OpenTelemetry demo application.

Abstract: The observability framework Kieker provides a range of analysis capabilities,
but it is currently only able to instrument a smaller selection of languages
and technologies, including Java, C, Fortran, and Python. The OpenTelemetry
standard aims for providing reference implementations for most programming
languages, including C# and JavaScript, that are currently not supported by
Kieker. In this work, we describe how to transform OpenTelemetry tracing data
into the Kieker framework. Thereby, it becomes possible to create for example
call trees from OpenTelemetry instrumentations. We demonstrate the usability of
our approach by visualizing trace data of the Astronomy Shop, which is an

Motivation: Performance changes in GitHub's 518 million projects are relevant to users, but detection is challenging despite GitHub CI/CD support.

Method: Integrated Nyrki"o change detection service into MooBench by adding measurement uploads, enabling performance change detection.

Result: Identified one major reproducible performance regression via GitHub actions, caused by a Linux Kernel version change.

Conclusion: Incorporating Nyrki"o into MooBench enables effective performance change detection on GitHub, with demonstrated application in identifying a kernel-related regression.

Abstract: In GitHub with its 518 million hosted projects, performance changes within
these projects are highly relevant to the project's users. Although performance
measurement is supported by GitHub CI/CD, performance change detection is a
challenging topic.
  In this paper, we demonstrate how we incorporated Nyrki\"o to MooBench. Prior
to this work, Moobench continuously ran on GitHub virtual machines, measuring
overhead of tracing agents, but without change detection. By adding the upload
of the measurements to the Nyrki\"o change detection service, we made it
possible to detect performance changes. We identified one major performance
regression and examined the performance change in depth. We report that (1) it
is reproducible with GitHub actions, and (2) the performance regression is
caused by a Linux Kernel version change.

TL;DR: This paper generalizes automatic question generation for program comprehension to Scratch, proposing 30 questions, extending LitterBox, generating 54M+ questions on 600k+ projects, and showing meaningfulness and relation to student performance via 34 ninth graders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assessing programming students via code completion alone doesn't guarantee concept comprehension; creating targeted questions for individual student programs is tedious, so automatic generation is needed, extended to Scratch.

Method: Proposed 30 questions covering an established program comprehension model, extended LitterBox static analysis tool to auto-generate questions for Scratch programs, and tested with 34 ninth graders.

Result: Generated 54,118,694 questions on 600,913 Scratch projects; initial experiments showed the approach generates meaningful questions, and students' ability to answer relates to overall performance.

Conclusion: Automatic question generation for Scratch programs is feasible, generates meaningful questions, and student answer ability correlates with their overall performance.

Abstract: When learning to program, students are usually assessed based on the code
they wrote. However, the mere completion of a programming task does not
guarantee actual comprehension of the underlying concepts. Asking learners
questions about the code they wrote has therefore been proposed as a means to
assess program comprehension. As creating targeted questions for individual
student programs can be tedious and challenging, prior work has proposed to
generate such questions automatically. In this paper we generalize this idea to
the block-based programming language Scratch. We propose a set of 30 different
questions for Scratch code covering an established program comprehension model,
and extend the LitterBox static analysis tool to automatically generate
corresponding questions for a given Scratch program. On a dataset of 600,913
projects we generated 54,118,694 questions automatically. Our initial
experiments with 34 ninth graders demonstrate that this approach can indeed
generate meaningful questions for Scratch programs, and we find that the
ability of students to answer these questions on their programs relates to
their overall performance.

Method: DeCerts modify the X.509 certificate standard with new extensions to specify delegated/non-delegated subdomains, control delegation depth, and allow domain owners to issue them independently of CAs; multiple revocation mechanisms balancing security, performance, and control are discussed, and Firefox is modified for validation as a proof-of-concept.

Result: Testing the modified Firefox demonstrates the feasibility and compatibility of DeCerts with browsers and TLS/HTTPS protocols.

Conclusion: DeCerts enhance the security, scalability, and manageability of CDN delegation, offering a practical solution for Internet services.

Abstract: The use of Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) has significantly increased over
the past decade, with approximately 55 million websites currently relying on
CDN services. Emerging solutions, such as Delegated Credentials (RFC 9345),
lack fine-grained definitions of many critical aspects of delegation, such as
the length of delegation chains, revocation mechanism, permitted operations,
and a well-defined scope for said delegation. We present Delegation
Certificates (DeCerts), which modify X.509 certificate standard and add new
extensions to enable fine-grained CDN delegation. DeCerts allow domain owners
to specify delegated and non-delegated subdomains, and control the depth of
delegation extended by CDNs, which provides flexibility in delegation
management. But more importantly, DeCerts are built on a new principle which
provides full autonomy to domain owners-domain owners can issue DeCerts fully
independent of Certificate Authorities (CAs), and thus have greater flexibility
in policy control, including revocation methods. Such level of flexibility
would be hard to match if CAs where to issue such certificates. Revoking a
DeCert revokes delegation. We discuss multiple revocation mechanisms for a
DeCerts balancing security, performance, and delegator control. We modify
Firefox to support DeCert (i.e., proper validation) as a proof-of-concept, and
test it to demonstrate the feasibility, compatibility of DeCerts with browsers
and TLS/HTTPS protocols. DeCerts enhance the security, scalability, and
manageability of CDN delegation, offering a practical solution for Internet
services.

### [95] [Pushing the Boundaries in CBRS Band: Robust Radar Detection within High 5G Interference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10040)
*Shafi Ullah Khan,Michel Kulhandjian,Debashri Roy*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: This paper investigates using machine learning (ML) to enhance spectrum sharing in the CBRS band, focusing on coexistence between commercial signals (e.g., 5G) and military radar systems, showing ML can extend FCC-recommended SINR boundaries for radar detection and identify radar waveforms with high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spectrum sharing faces challenges in effective regulation and technological enablement, especially coexistence with incumbent systems like military communications; there's a need to enhance capabilities within the CBRS band.

Method: The paper uses ML-based approaches, utilizing In-phase/Quadrature (IQ) data and spectrograms, to improve radar detection and waveform identification in high-interference environments.

Result: Proposed ML models achieve 99% radar detection accuracy even with high 5G interference up to -5dB SINR (extending from ~12dB), and classify six radar waveform types with 93% accuracy.

Conclusion: ML techniques can potentially extend FCC-recommended SINR boundaries by improving radar detection and waveform identification in high-interference environments for spectrum sharing in the CBRS band.

Abstract: Spectrum sharing is a critical strategy for meeting escalating user demands
via commercial wireless services, yet its effective regulation and
technological enablement, particularly concerning coexistence with incumbent
systems, remain significant challenges. Federal organizations have established
regulatory frameworks to manage shared commercial use alongside
mission-critical operations, such as military communications. This paper
investigates the potential of machine learning (ML)-based approaches to enhance
spectrum sharing capabilities within the Citizens Broadband Radio Service
(CBRS) band, specifically focusing on the coexistence of commercial signals
(e.g., 5G) and military radar systems. We demonstrate that ML techniques can
potentially extend the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)-recommended
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) boundaries by improving radar
detection and waveform identification in high-interference environments.
Through rigorous evaluation using both synthetic and real-world signals, our
findings indicate that proposed ML models, utilizing In-phase/Quadrature (IQ)
data and spectrograms, can achieve the FCC-recommended $99\%$ radar detection
accuracy even when subjected to high interference from 5G signals upto -5dB
SINR, exceeding the required limits of $20$ SINR. Our experimental studies
distinguish this work from the state-of-the-art by significantly extending the
SINR limit for $99\%$ radar detection accuracy from approximately $12$ dB down
to $-5$ dB. Subsequent to detection, we further apply ML to analyze and
identify radar waveforms. The proposed models also demonstrate the capability
to classify six distinct radar waveform types with $93\%$ accuracy.

*Rahul Vanukuri,Shafi Ullah Khan,Talip Tolga Sarı,Gokhan Secinti,Diego Patiño,Debashri Roy*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a diffusion-based generative model to synthesize diverse spectrograms (LTE, 5G, radar in CBRS band) to address data scarcity for radar detection, with generated data improving training efficiency (51.5% faster convergence) and showing structural/statistical fidelity via SSIM and PSNR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for robust radar detection in shared bands (e.g., CBRS) requires large labeled spectrogram datasets, but collecting/annotating real-world RF data is challenging due to rare radar signals, limiting AI model performance.

Method: A diffusion-based generative model is proposed to synthesize realistic, diverse spectrograms of five categories integrating LTE, 5G, and radar signals in the CBRS band; structural/statistical fidelity is analyzed using SSIM and PSNR.

Result: Generated spectrograms show structural and statistical fidelity (via SSIM/PSNR), and pre-training on them enables 51.5% faster convergence for a real-world radar detection task.

Conclusion: The diffusion-based generative model effectively addresses data scarcity in radar detection by synthesizing realistic spectrograms, improving training efficiency.

Abstract: The growing demand for effective spectrum management and interference
mitigation in shared bands, such as the Citizens Broadband Radio Service
(CBRS), requires robust radar detection algorithms to protect the military
transmission from interference due to commercial wireless transmission. These
algorithms, in turn, depend on large, diverse, and carefully labeled
spectrogram datasets. However, collecting and annotating real-world radio
frequency (RF) spectrogram data remains a significant challenge, as radar
signals are rare, and their occurrences are infrequent. This challenge makes
the creation of balanced datasets difficult, limiting the performance and
generalizability of AI models in this domain.
  To address this critical issue, we propose a diffusion-based generative model
for synthesizing realistic and diverse spectrograms of five distinct categories
that integrate LTE, 5G, and radar signals within the CBRS band. We conduct a
structural and statistical fidelity analysis of the generated spectrograms
using widely accepted evaluation metrics Structural Similarity Index Measure
(SSIM) and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), to quantify their divergence from
the training data. Furthermore, we demonstrate that pre-training on the
generated spectrograms significantly improves training efficiency on a
real-world radar detection task by enabling $51.5\%$ faster convergence.

### [97] [Hybrid MAC Protocol with Integrated Multi-Layered Security for Resource-Constrained UAV Swarm Communications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10236)
*Dhrumil Bhatt,Siddharth Penumatsa,Vidushi Kumar*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a hardware-software co-design framework for secure and adaptive UAV swarm communications (FANETs) with an energy-aware protocol stack, integrating dynamic trust scores, hybrid MAC, zero-trust security, and hardware-accelerated encryption, outperforming existing protocols in simulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FANET routing protocols optimize for single metrics (e.g., path length/energy) while neglecting dependencies between network performance, security, and MAC layer efficiency, posing challenges due to high mobility, dynamic topologies, and resource constraints.

Method: A hardware-software co-design framework with multicast clustered organization, routing integrating dynamic trust scores/link quality/distance, hybrid MAC (contention + scheduled access), zero-trust security (cryptographic auth + behavioral reputation), and hardware-accelerated AES-GCM encryption.

Result: NS-3 simulations show the framework outperforms existing protocols in packet delivery ratio, latency, resilience, and overhead, providing a scalable foundation for high-performance swarm operations.

Conclusion: The novel framework addresses FANET challenges by integrating multiple metrics and security features, demonstrating superiority in key performance indicators, suitable for scalable, secure, and adaptive UAV swarm communications.

Abstract: Flying Ad Hoc Networks (FANETs) present unique challenges due to high node
mobility, dynamic topologies, and strict resource constraints. Existing routing
protocols often optimize for a single metric, such as path length or energy,
while neglecting the complex dependencies between network performance,
security, and MAC layer efficiency. This paper introduces a novel hardware
software co design framework for secure and adaptive UAV swarm communications,
featuring an energy aware protocol stack. The architecture employs a multicast,
clustered organization where routing decisions integrate dynamic trust scores,
historical link quality, and internodal distance. A hybrid MAC protocol
combines contention based and scheduled channel access for optimized
throughput. Security is ensured through a zero trust model that fuses
cryptographic authentication with a behavioral reputation system, alongside
hardware accelerated AES GCM encryption. Comparative analysis in an NS 3
simulation environment demonstrates the framework's superiority in packet
delivery ratio, latency, resilience, and overhead, providing a scalable
foundation for high performance swarm operations.

### [98] [A Framework for AI-Native Semantic-Based Dynamic Slicing for 6G Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10756)
*Mayukh Roy Chowdhury,Eman Hammad,Lauri Loven,Susanna Pirttikangas,Aloizio P da Silva,Walid Saad*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: This paper proposes semantic slicing for 6G networks, integrating data content/semantics into network optimization to handle ultra-dense/diverse environments, enabling dynamic, cross-layer integration of communication, computing, etc.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current network approaches compartmentalize data from operations, failing to optimize resources for 6G's ultra-dense, diverse, and dynamic environment.

Method: Semantic slicing: a two-pronged approach creating multiple virtual divisions in physical/data infrastructure, with distinct characteristics, applied dynamically across resource levels in the computing continuum, using data semantics for optimization.

Result: The article opens opportunities for integrating communication, computing, cyber-physical systems, data flow, and AI via cross-layer design.

Conclusion: Semantic slicing represents a novel shift from static techniques, advancing semantic communication by dynamically applying to computing continuum resources.

Abstract: In the ensuing ultra-dense and diverse environment in future \ac{6G}
communication networks, it will be critical to optimize network resources via
mechanisms that recognize and cater to the diversity, density, and dynamicity
of system changes. However, coping with such environments cannot be done
through the current network approach of compartmentalizing data as distinct
from network operations. Instead, we envision a computing continuum where the
content of the transmitted data is considered as an essential element in the
transmission of that data, with data sources and streams analyzed and distilled
to their essential elements, based on their semantic context, and then
processed and transmitted over dedicated slices of network resources. By
exploiting the rich content and semantics within data for dynamic and
autonomous optimization of the computing continuum, this article opens the door
to integrating communication, computing, cyber-physical systems, data flow, and
AI, presenting new and exciting opportunities for cross-layer design. We
propose semantic slicing, a two-pronged approach that builds multiple virtual
divisions within a single physical and data infrastructure, each with its own
distinct characteristics and needs. We view semantic slicing as a novel shift
from current static slicing techniques, extending existing slicing approaches
such that it can be applied dynamically at different levels and categories of
resources in the computing continuum. Further it propels the advancement of
semantic communication via the proposed architectural framework.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: ByteDance presents Zephyrus, a production-scale cloud gateway integrating Tofino and DPUs with a unified P4 pipeline and hierarchical co-offloading architecture (HLCO), achieving >99% hardware offloading, 33% higher throughput than LuoShen, 21% lower power consumption, 14% lower hardware cost, and doubling throughput vs. Albatross with lower TCO, along with key production lessons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ByteDance's previous cloud gateways face unsustainable resource pressure due to massive petabit-scale traffic growth, prompting the need to integrate DPUs with Tofino-based gateways for larger table capacities and richer programmability without compromising latency/throughput.

Method: Zephyrus uses a unified P4 pipeline across Tofino and DPUs, plus a hierarchical co-offloading architecture (HLCO) to orchestrate traffic, with >99% hardware offloading and software fallback for complex operations.

Result: Zephyrus outperforms LuoShen by 33% higher throughput, has 21% lower power consumption and 14% lower hardware cost; doubles throughput vs. Albatross with lower TCO, and achieves >99% hardware offloading.

Conclusion: Zephyrus successfully integrates DPUs into cloud gateways, offering superior performance, lower costs, and power efficiency, with shared production lessons providing valuable references for designing performant cloud gateways.

Abstract: Operating at petabit-scale, ByteDance's cloud gateways are deployed at
critical aggregation points to orchestrate a wide array of business traffic.
However, this massive scale imposes significant resource pressure on our
previous-generation cloud gateways, rendering them unsustainable in the face of
ever-growing cloud-network traffic. As the DPU market rapidly expands, we see a
promising path to meet our escalating business traffic demands by integrating
DPUs with our established Tofino-based gateways. DPUs augment these gateways
with substantially larger table capacities and richer programmability without
compromising previously low-latency and high-throughput forwarding. Despite
compelling advantages, the practical integration of DPUs into cloud gateways
remains unexplored, primarily due to underlying challenges. In this paper, we
present Zephyrus, a production-scale gateway built upon a unified P4 pipeline
spanning high-performance Tofino and feature-rich DPUs, which successfully
overcomes these challenges. We further introduce a hierarchical co-offloading
architecture (HLCO) to orchestrate traffic flow within this heterogeneous
gateway, achieving > 99% hardware offloading while retaining software fallback
paths for complex operations. Zephyrus outperforms LuoShen (NSDI '24) with 33%
higher throughput and our evaluation further indicates 21% lower power
consumption and 14% lower hardware cost. Against FPGA-based systems, Albatross
(SIGCOMM '25), it doubles the throughput at a substantially lower Total Cost of
Ownership (TCO), showcasing its superior performance-per-dollar. Beyond these
performance gains, we also share key lessons from several years of developing
and operating Zephyrus at production scale. We believe these insights provide
valuable references for researchers and practitioners designing performant
cloud gateways.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: This paper presents a GNN-based multicast routing framework for 6G wireless networks to minimize total transmission cost and support user-specific video quality requirements, addressing limitations of traditional and neural network-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increase of bandwidth-intensive applications in 6G demands intelligent multicast routing solutions with differentiated QoS, but traditional algorithms are computationally prohibitive/rigid and neural network-based approaches lack topological generalization and scalability.

Method: Formulates the routing problem as a constrained minimum-flow optimization task, develops a reinforcement learning algorithm to construct multicast trees by reusing paths/adapting to dynamics, uses GAT as encoder for node embeddings and LSTM for sequential dependencies in routing decisions.

Result: Extensive simulations show the method closely approximates optimal dynamic programming solutions with reduced computational complexity and generalizes well to large-scale/dynamic network topologies.

Conclusion: The proposed GNN-based framework has potential for real-time deployment in 6G multimedia delivery scenarios.

Abstract: The increase of bandwidth-intensive applications in sixth-generation (6G)
wireless networks, such as real-time volumetric streaming and multi-sensory
extended reality, demands intelligent multicast routing solutions capable of
delivering differentiated quality-of-service (QoS) at scale. Traditional
shortest-path and multicast routing algorithms are either computationally
prohibitive or structurally rigid, and they often fail to support heterogeneous
user demands, leading to suboptimal resource utilization. Neural network-based
approaches, while offering improved inference speed, typically lack topological
generalization and scalability. To address these limitations, this paper
presents a graph neural network (GNN)-based multicast routing framework that
jointly minimizes total transmission cost and supports user-specific video
quality requirements. The routing problem is formulated as a constrained
minimum-flow optimization task, and a reinforcement learning algorithm is
developed to sequentially construct efficient multicast trees by reusing paths
and adapting to network dynamics. A graph attention network (GAT) is employed
as the encoder to extract context-aware node embeddings, while a long
short-term memory (LSTM) module models the sequential dependencies in routing
decisions. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed method closely
approximates optimal dynamic programming-based solutions while significantly
reducing computational complexity. The results also confirm strong
generalization to large-scale and dynamic network topologies, highlighting the
method's potential for real-time deployment in 6G multimedia delivery
scenarios. Code is available at https://github.com/UNIC-Lab/GNN-Routing.

Abstract: The advent of the fifth-generation technology promises to bring about more
vertical applications and emerging services that include vehicular networks and
intelligent transportation systems (ITSs). To achieve their vision of real-time
and safetyapplications, vehicular networks rely on short-range to medium-range
communications. One emerging technology that aims to provide reliability and
high-data rate in short-range communications is the visible light
communications (VLC). Due to its remarkable advantages, some studies have
recently investigated the integration of VLC in vehicular networks and ITSs.
Despite their attractive features, such networks also face several
implementation issues. This paper provides an extended tutorial on the
implementation of VLC-based vehicular networks. To begin with, we present the
implementation characteristics of these systems and discuss some related
issues. The underlying system considers a general structure with transmitters,
channels, and receivers based on photodetectors and cameras, as well as
standardization efforts and types of topologies. In addition, we discuss the
impact of the sun and artificial light sources, flickering, dimming, throughput
enhancement, uplink security, and mobility on practical implementation.
Finally, we highlight some key challenges and potential solutions and provide
some directions for future research investigations that could constitute an

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze the primary user's AoI performance in a cognitive shared access network with energy harvesting capabilities, considering secondary users' spatial distribution and interference/energy management.

Method: Introduces two zones (energy harvesting zone around primary transmitter and guard zone around primary receiver, prohibiting secondary transmissions there); secondary users access the channel probabilistically based on battery state and guard zone location; analyzes under three packet management policies.

Result: Not explicitly stated in the abstract.

Conclusion: Not explicitly stated in the abstract.

Abstract: This study investigates a cognitive shared access network with energy
harvesting capabilities operating under Age of Information (AoI) constraints
for the primary user. Secondary transmitters are spatially distributed
according to a homogeneous Poisson Point Process (PPP), while the primary user
is located at a fixed position. The primary transmitter handles bursty packet
arrivals, whereas secondary users operate under saturated traffic conditions.
To manage interference and energy, two distinct zones are introduced: an energy
harvesting zone around the primary transmitter and a guard zone around the
primary receiver, within which secondary transmissions are prohibited.
Secondary users access the channel probabilistically, with access decisions
depending on their current battery state (charged or empty) and their location
relative to the guard zone. Our objective is to analyze the primary user's AoI
performance under three distinct packet management policies.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: This study investigates traffic from three leading GenAI chatbots (ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini) on Android apps for text/image generation, using two datasets (60-hour generic and controlled) to analyze distinctiveness, differences from other traffic, and network implications, revealing app/content-specific patterns, TLS/QUIC usage, SNI's role in classification, and unique stress factors for mobile networks, with datasets publicly released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GenAI chatbots are pervasive but their network traffic is underexplored, prompting investigation into distinctiveness, differences from deployed traffic, and novel network usage implications.

Method: Using a dedicated capture architecture, two complementary workloads are collected: a 60-hour generic dataset with unconstrained prompts and a controlled dataset with identical prompts across GenAI apps (replicated via messaging apps for comparison). Fine-grained traffic characterization at trace/flow/protocol levels and Multimodal Markov Chains for packet-sequence dynamics modeling, plus payload-based occlusion analysis for SNI contribution.

Result: Analyses show app- and content-specific traffic patterns (volume, uplink/downlink, protocol adoption); TLS predominates (Gemini uses QUIC, ChatGPT uses TLS 1.3), with app/content-specific SNI values. Masking SNI reduces GenAI app traffic classification F1-score by up to 20pp. GenAI chatbots have unique traffic vs. messaging apps with same content, introducing mobile network stress factors like sustained upstream activity.

Conclusion: GenAI chatbot traffic exhibits distinct, app/content-specific characteristics with implications for network monitoring/management; public datasets support reproducibility and extensions.

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) chatbots are now pervasive in digital ecosystems, yet
their network traffic remains largely underexplored. This study presents an
in-depth investigation of traffic generated by three leading chatbots (ChatGPT,
Copilot, and Gemini) when accessed via Android mobile apps for both text and
image generation. Using a dedicated capture architecture, we collect and label
two complementary workloads: a 60-hour generic dataset with unconstrained
prompts, and a controlled dataset built from identical prompts across GenAI
apps and replicated via conventional messaging apps to enable one-to-one
comparisons. This dual design allows us to address practical research questions
on the distinctiveness of GenAI traffic, its differences from widely deployed
traffic categories, and its novel implications for network usage. To this end,
we provide fine-grained traffic characterization at trace, flow, and protocol
levels, and model packet-sequence dynamics with Multimodal Markov Chains. Our
analyses reveal app- and content-specific traffic patterns, particularly in
volume, uplink/downlink profiles, and protocol adoption. We highlight the
predominance of TLS, with Gemini extensively leveraging QUIC, ChatGPT
exclusively using TLS 1.3, and app- and content-specific Server Name Indication
(SNI) values. A payload-based occlusion analysis quantifies SNI's contribution
to classification: masking it reduces F1-score by up to 20 percentage points in
GenAI app traffic classification. Finally, compared with conventional messaging
apps when carrying the same content, GenAI chatbots exhibit unique traffic
characteristics, highlighting new stress factors for mobile networks, such as
sustained upstream activity, with direct implications for network monitoring
and management. We publicly release the datasets to support reproducibility and
foster extensions to other use cases.

*Muhammad Bilal,Xiaolong Xu*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: This paper presents a Network-Optimised Spiking (NOS) delay-aware scheduler for 6G radio access, which couples a bounded two-state kernel with a clique-feasible proportional-fair (PF) grant head, analyzes its stability via small-signal analysis, proves geometric ergodicity and derives backlog/delay bounds, and shows via numerical study that NOS outperforms PF and delayed backpressure (BP) in utilisation and 99.9th-percentile delay under a DU compute budget.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address delay-aware scheduling for 6G radio access, considering factors like interference, controller gain, and delay in a unified design parameter.

Method: The NOS scheduler couples a bounded two-state kernel (excitability as finite-buffer proxy, recovery to suppress repeated grants) with a clique-feasible PF grant head, injects neighbour pressure via delayed spikes along the interference graph; uses small-signal analysis to derive delay-dependent threshold k_*(Δ) and spectral margin δ = k_*(Δ) - gHρ(W), and conducts numerical study comparing with PF and delayed BP across interference topologies over 5 - 20 ms delay.

Result: Under light arrival assumptions, geometric ergodicity is proven for δ>0, with sub-Gaussian backlog and delay tail bounds having exponents proportional to δ; numerical study shows NOS, with a single gain fixed at worst spectral radius, sustains higher utilisation and smaller 99.9th-percentile delay than PF and delayed BP, while remaining clique-feasible on integer PRBs under a DU compute budget.

Conclusion: The NOS scheduler effectively addresses delay-aware scheduling for 6G radio access, offering improved utilisation and delay performance compared to existing schemes like PF and delayed BP, with key design parameters derived from small-signal analysis ensuring stability and feasibility.

Abstract: This work presents a Network-Optimised Spiking (NOS) delay-aware scheduler
for 6G radio access. The scheme couples a bounded two-state kernel to a
clique-feasible proportional-fair (PF) grant head: the excitability state acts
as a finite-buffer proxy, the recovery state suppresses repeated grants, and
neighbour pressure is injected along the interference graph via delayed spikes.
A small-signal analysis yields a delay-dependent threshold $k_\star(\Delta)$
and a spectral margin $\delta = k_\star(\Delta) - gH\rho(W)$ that compress
topology, controller gain, and delay into a single design parameter. Under
light assumptions on arrivals, we prove geometric ergodicity for $\delta>0$ and
derive sub-Gaussian backlog and delay tail bounds with exponents proportional
to $\delta$. A numerical study, aligned with the analysis and a DU compute
budget, compares NOS with PF and delayed backpressure (BP) across interference
topologies over a $5$--$20$\,ms delay sweep. With a single gain fixed at the
worst spectral radius, NOS sustains higher utilisation and a smaller
99.9th-percentile delay while remaining clique-feasible on integer PRBs.

### [106] [A Flexible Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework for Dynamic Routing and Scheduling of Latency-Critical Services](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11535)
*Vincenzo Norman Vitale,Antonia Maria Tulino,Andreas F. Molisch,Jaime Llorca*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of reliably delivering delay-sensitive packets within deadlines in dynamic networks using a novel Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MA-DRL) framework, which combines centralized routing and distributed scheduling based on MADDPG, outperforming traditional stochastic optimization approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Timely delivery of delay-sensitive information in dynamic, heterogeneous networks is crucial for applications like industrial automation and self-driving vehicles, but existing solutions only target average delay and lack strict End-to-End (E2E) peak latency guarantees.

Method: The paper proposes a novel MA-DRL network control framework with a centralized routing and distributed scheduling architecture, leveraging MADDPG and networking domain knowledge to design strategies where agents assign paths and schedule transmissions based on packet lifetimes, integrating both DRL agents and traditional rule-based policies.

Result: The proposed framework outperforms traditional stochastic optimization-based approaches in efficiently controlling latency-critical services.

Conclusion: The framework's superiority is confirmed, providing insights into the interplay between data-driven DRL agents and rule-based policies for high-performance, low-latency network control.

Abstract: Timely delivery of delay-sensitive information over dynamic, heterogeneous
networks is increasingly essential for a range of interactive applications,
such as industrial automation, self-driving vehicles, and augmented reality.
However, most existing network control solutions target only average delay
performance, falling short of providing strict End-to-End (E2E) peak latency
guarantees. This paper addresses the challenge of reliably delivering packets
within application-imposed deadlines by leveraging recent advancements in
Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MA-DRL). After introducing the
Delay-Constrained Maximum-Throughput (DCMT) dynamic network control problem,
and highlighting the limitations of current solutions, we present a novel
MA-DRL network control framework that leverages a centralized routing and
distributed scheduling architecture. The proposed framework leverages critical
networking domain knowledge for the design of effective MA-DRL strategies based
on the Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) technique, where
centralized routing and distributed scheduling agents dynamically assign paths
and schedule packet transmissions according to packet lifetimes, thereby
maximizing on-time packet delivery. The generality of the proposed framework
allows integrating both data-driven \blue{Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)}
agents and traditional rule-based policies in order to strike the right balance
between performance and learning complexity. Our results confirm the
superiority of the proposed framework with respect to traditional stochastic
