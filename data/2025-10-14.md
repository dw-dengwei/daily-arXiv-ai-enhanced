Abstract: Energy efficiency has emerged as a defining constraint in the evolution of
sustainable Internet of Things (IoT) networks. This work moves beyond
simulation-based or device-centric studies to deliver measurement-driven,
network-level smart energy analysis. The proposed system enables end-to-end
visibility of energy flows across distributed IoT infrastructures, uniting
Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and Visible Light Communication (VLC) modes with
environmental sensing and E-ink display subsystems under a unified profiling
and prediction platform. Through automated, time-synchronized instrumentation,
the framework captures fine-grained energy dynamics across both node and
gateway layers. We developed a suite of tools that generate energy datasets for
IoT ecosystems, addressing the scarcity of such data and enabling AI-based
predictive and adaptive energy optimization. Validated within a network-level
IoT testbed, the approach demonstrates robust performance under real operating
conditions.

Abstract: The use of Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) has significantly increased over
the past decade, with approximately 55 million websites currently relying on
CDN services. Emerging solutions, such as Delegated Credentials (RFC 9345),
lack fine-grained definitions of many critical aspects of delegation, such as
the length of delegation chains, revocation mechanism, permitted operations,
and a well-defined scope for said delegation. We present Delegation
Certificates (DeCerts), which modify X.509 certificate standard and add new
extensions to enable fine-grained CDN delegation. DeCerts allow domain owners
to specify delegated and non-delegated subdomains, and control the depth of
delegation extended by CDNs, which provides flexibility in delegation
management. But more importantly, DeCerts are built on a new principle which
provides full autonomy to domain owners-domain owners can issue DeCerts fully
independent of Certificate Authorities (CAs), and thus have greater flexibility
in policy control, including revocation methods. Such level of flexibility
would be hard to match if CAs where to issue such certificates. Revoking a
DeCert revokes delegation. We discuss multiple revocation mechanisms for a
DeCerts balancing security, performance, and delegator control. We modify
Firefox to support DeCert (i.e., proper validation) as a proof-of-concept, and
test it to demonstrate the feasibility, compatibility of DeCerts with browsers
and TLS/HTTPS protocols. DeCerts enhance the security, scalability, and
manageability of CDN delegation, offering a practical solution for Internet
services.

Abstract: Spectrum sharing is a critical strategy for meeting escalating user demands
via commercial wireless services, yet its effective regulation and
technological enablement, particularly concerning coexistence with incumbent
systems, remain significant challenges. Federal organizations have established
regulatory frameworks to manage shared commercial use alongside
mission-critical operations, such as military communications. This paper
investigates the potential of machine learning (ML)-based approaches to enhance
spectrum sharing capabilities within the Citizens Broadband Radio Service
(CBRS) band, specifically focusing on the coexistence of commercial signals
(e.g., 5G) and military radar systems. We demonstrate that ML techniques can
potentially extend the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)-recommended
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) boundaries by improving radar
detection and waveform identification in high-interference environments.
Through rigorous evaluation using both synthetic and real-world signals, our
findings indicate that proposed ML models, utilizing In-phase/Quadrature (IQ)
data and spectrograms, can achieve the FCC-recommended $99\%$ radar detection
accuracy even when subjected to high interference from 5G signals upto -5dB
SINR, exceeding the required limits of $20$ SINR. Our experimental studies
distinguish this work from the state-of-the-art by significantly extending the
SINR limit for $99\%$ radar detection accuracy from approximately $12$ dB down
to $-5$ dB. Subsequent to detection, we further apply ML to analyze and
identify radar waveforms. The proposed models also demonstrate the capability
to classify six distinct radar waveform types with $93\%$ accuracy.

Abstract: The growing demand for effective spectrum management and interference
mitigation in shared bands, such as the Citizens Broadband Radio Service
(CBRS), requires robust radar detection algorithms to protect the military
transmission from interference due to commercial wireless transmission. These
algorithms, in turn, depend on large, diverse, and carefully labeled
spectrogram datasets. However, collecting and annotating real-world radio
frequency (RF) spectrogram data remains a significant challenge, as radar
signals are rare, and their occurrences are infrequent. This challenge makes
the creation of balanced datasets difficult, limiting the performance and
generalizability of AI models in this domain.
  To address this critical issue, we propose a diffusion-based generative model
for synthesizing realistic and diverse spectrograms of five distinct categories
that integrate LTE, 5G, and radar signals within the CBRS band. We conduct a
structural and statistical fidelity analysis of the generated spectrograms
using widely accepted evaluation metrics Structural Similarity Index Measure
(SSIM) and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), to quantify their divergence from
the training data. Furthermore, we demonstrate that pre-training on the
generated spectrograms significantly improves training efficiency on a
real-world radar detection task by enabling $51.5\%$ faster convergence.

Abstract: Flying Ad Hoc Networks (FANETs) present unique challenges due to high node
mobility, dynamic topologies, and strict resource constraints. Existing routing
protocols often optimize for a single metric, such as path length or energy,
while neglecting the complex dependencies between network performance,
security, and MAC layer efficiency. This paper introduces a novel hardware
software co design framework for secure and adaptive UAV swarm communications,
featuring an energy aware protocol stack. The architecture employs a multicast,
clustered organization where routing decisions integrate dynamic trust scores,
historical link quality, and internodal distance. A hybrid MAC protocol
combines contention based and scheduled channel access for optimized
throughput. Security is ensured through a zero trust model that fuses
cryptographic authentication with a behavioral reputation system, alongside
hardware accelerated AES GCM encryption. Comparative analysis in an NS 3
simulation environment demonstrates the framework's superiority in packet
delivery ratio, latency, resilience, and overhead, providing a scalable
foundation for high performance swarm operations.

Abstract: In the ensuing ultra-dense and diverse environment in future \ac{6G}
communication networks, it will be critical to optimize network resources via
mechanisms that recognize and cater to the diversity, density, and dynamicity
of system changes. However, coping with such environments cannot be done
through the current network approach of compartmentalizing data as distinct
from network operations. Instead, we envision a computing continuum where the
content of the transmitted data is considered as an essential element in the
transmission of that data, with data sources and streams analyzed and distilled
to their essential elements, based on their semantic context, and then
processed and transmitted over dedicated slices of network resources. By
exploiting the rich content and semantics within data for dynamic and
autonomous optimization of the computing continuum, this article opens the door
to integrating communication, computing, cyber-physical systems, data flow, and
AI, presenting new and exciting opportunities for cross-layer design. We
propose semantic slicing, a two-pronged approach that builds multiple virtual
divisions within a single physical and data infrastructure, each with its own
distinct characteristics and needs. We view semantic slicing as a novel shift
from current static slicing techniques, extending existing slicing approaches
such that it can be applied dynamically at different levels and categories of
resources in the computing continuum. Further it propels the advancement of
semantic communication via the proposed architectural framework.

Abstract: Operating at petabit-scale, ByteDance's cloud gateways are deployed at
critical aggregation points to orchestrate a wide array of business traffic.
However, this massive scale imposes significant resource pressure on our
previous-generation cloud gateways, rendering them unsustainable in the face of
ever-growing cloud-network traffic. As the DPU market rapidly expands, we see a
promising path to meet our escalating business traffic demands by integrating
DPUs with our established Tofino-based gateways. DPUs augment these gateways
with substantially larger table capacities and richer programmability without
compromising previously low-latency and high-throughput forwarding. Despite
compelling advantages, the practical integration of DPUs into cloud gateways
remains unexplored, primarily due to underlying challenges. In this paper, we
present Zephyrus, a production-scale gateway built upon a unified P4 pipeline
spanning high-performance Tofino and feature-rich DPUs, which successfully
overcomes these challenges. We further introduce a hierarchical co-offloading
architecture (HLCO) to orchestrate traffic flow within this heterogeneous
gateway, achieving > 99% hardware offloading while retaining software fallback
paths for complex operations. Zephyrus outperforms LuoShen (NSDI '24) with 33%
higher throughput and our evaluation further indicates 21% lower power
consumption and 14% lower hardware cost. Against FPGA-based systems, Albatross
(SIGCOMM '25), it doubles the throughput at a substantially lower Total Cost of
Ownership (TCO), showcasing its superior performance-per-dollar. Beyond these
performance gains, we also share key lessons from several years of developing
and operating Zephyrus at production scale. We believe these insights provide
valuable references for researchers and practitioners designing performant
cloud gateways.

Abstract: The increase of bandwidth-intensive applications in sixth-generation (6G)
wireless networks, such as real-time volumetric streaming and multi-sensory
extended reality, demands intelligent multicast routing solutions capable of
delivering differentiated quality-of-service (QoS) at scale. Traditional
shortest-path and multicast routing algorithms are either computationally
prohibitive or structurally rigid, and they often fail to support heterogeneous
user demands, leading to suboptimal resource utilization. Neural network-based
approaches, while offering improved inference speed, typically lack topological
generalization and scalability. To address these limitations, this paper
presents a graph neural network (GNN)-based multicast routing framework that
jointly minimizes total transmission cost and supports user-specific video
quality requirements. The routing problem is formulated as a constrained
minimum-flow optimization task, and a reinforcement learning algorithm is
developed to sequentially construct efficient multicast trees by reusing paths
and adapting to network dynamics. A graph attention network (GAT) is employed
as the encoder to extract context-aware node embeddings, while a long
short-term memory (LSTM) module models the sequential dependencies in routing
decisions. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed method closely
approximates optimal dynamic programming-based solutions while significantly
reducing computational complexity. The results also confirm strong
generalization to large-scale and dynamic network topologies, highlighting the
method's potential for real-time deployment in 6G multimedia delivery
scenarios. Code is available at https://github.com/UNIC-Lab/GNN-Routing.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The advent of the fifth-generation technology promises to bring about more
vertical applications and emerging services that include vehicular networks and
intelligent transportation systems (ITSs). To achieve their vision of real-time
and safetyapplications, vehicular networks rely on short-range to medium-range
communications. One emerging technology that aims to provide reliability and
high-data rate in short-range communications is the visible light
communications (VLC). Due to its remarkable advantages, some studies have
recently investigated the integration of VLC in vehicular networks and ITSs.
Despite their attractive features, such networks also face several
implementation issues. This paper provides an extended tutorial on the
implementation of VLC-based vehicular networks. To begin with, we present the
implementation characteristics of these systems and discuss some related
issues. The underlying system considers a general structure with transmitters,
channels, and receivers based on photodetectors and cameras, as well as
standardization efforts and types of topologies. In addition, we discuss the
impact of the sun and artificial light sources, flickering, dimming, throughput
enhancement, uplink security, and mobility on practical implementation.
Finally, we highlight some key challenges and potential solutions and provide
some directions for future research investigations that could constitute an
advancement toward the development of commercial VLC-based vehicular systems.

Abstract: This study investigates a cognitive shared access network with energy
harvesting capabilities operating under Age of Information (AoI) constraints
for the primary user. Secondary transmitters are spatially distributed
according to a homogeneous Poisson Point Process (PPP), while the primary user
is located at a fixed position. The primary transmitter handles bursty packet
arrivals, whereas secondary users operate under saturated traffic conditions.
To manage interference and energy, two distinct zones are introduced: an energy
harvesting zone around the primary transmitter and a guard zone around the
primary receiver, within which secondary transmissions are prohibited.
Secondary users access the channel probabilistically, with access decisions
depending on their current battery state (charged or empty) and their location
relative to the guard zone. Our objective is to analyze the primary user's AoI
performance under three distinct packet management policies.

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) chatbots are now pervasive in digital ecosystems, yet
their network traffic remains largely underexplored. This study presents an
in-depth investigation of traffic generated by three leading chatbots (ChatGPT,
Copilot, and Gemini) when accessed via Android mobile apps for both text and
image generation. Using a dedicated capture architecture, we collect and label
two complementary workloads: a 60-hour generic dataset with unconstrained
prompts, and a controlled dataset built from identical prompts across GenAI
apps and replicated via conventional messaging apps to enable one-to-one
comparisons. This dual design allows us to address practical research questions
on the distinctiveness of GenAI traffic, its differences from widely deployed
traffic categories, and its novel implications for network usage. To this end,
we provide fine-grained traffic characterization at trace, flow, and protocol
levels, and model packet-sequence dynamics with Multimodal Markov Chains. Our
analyses reveal app- and content-specific traffic patterns, particularly in
volume, uplink/downlink profiles, and protocol adoption. We highlight the
predominance of TLS, with Gemini extensively leveraging QUIC, ChatGPT
exclusively using TLS 1.3, and app- and content-specific Server Name Indication
(SNI) values. A payload-based occlusion analysis quantifies SNI's contribution
to classification: masking it reduces F1-score by up to 20 percentage points in
GenAI app traffic classification. Finally, compared with conventional messaging
apps when carrying the same content, GenAI chatbots exhibit unique traffic
characteristics, highlighting new stress factors for mobile networks, such as
sustained upstream activity, with direct implications for network monitoring
and management. We publicly release the datasets to support reproducibility and
foster extensions to other use cases.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: This work presents a Network-Optimised Spiking (NOS) delay-aware scheduler
for 6G radio access. The scheme couples a bounded two-state kernel to a
clique-feasible proportional-fair (PF) grant head: the excitability state acts
as a finite-buffer proxy, the recovery state suppresses repeated grants, and
neighbour pressure is injected along the interference graph via delayed spikes.
A small-signal analysis yields a delay-dependent threshold $k_\star(\Delta)$
and a spectral margin $\delta = k_\star(\Delta) - gH\rho(W)$ that compress
topology, controller gain, and delay into a single design parameter. Under
light assumptions on arrivals, we prove geometric ergodicity for $\delta>0$ and
derive sub-Gaussian backlog and delay tail bounds with exponents proportional
to $\delta$. A numerical study, aligned with the analysis and a DU compute
budget, compares NOS with PF and delayed backpressure (BP) across interference
topologies over a $5$--$20$\,ms delay sweep. With a single gain fixed at the
worst spectral radius, NOS sustains higher utilisation and a smaller
99.9th-percentile delay while remaining clique-feasible on integer PRBs.

Abstract: Timely delivery of delay-sensitive information over dynamic, heterogeneous
networks is increasingly essential for a range of interactive applications,
such as industrial automation, self-driving vehicles, and augmented reality.
However, most existing network control solutions target only average delay
performance, falling short of providing strict End-to-End (E2E) peak latency
guarantees. This paper addresses the challenge of reliably delivering packets
within application-imposed deadlines by leveraging recent advancements in
Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MA-DRL). After introducing the
Delay-Constrained Maximum-Throughput (DCMT) dynamic network control problem,
and highlighting the limitations of current solutions, we present a novel
MA-DRL network control framework that leverages a centralized routing and
distributed scheduling architecture. The proposed framework leverages critical
networking domain knowledge for the design of effective MA-DRL strategies based
on the Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) technique, where
centralized routing and distributed scheduling agents dynamically assign paths
and schedule packet transmissions according to packet lifetimes, thereby
maximizing on-time packet delivery. The generality of the proposed framework
allows integrating both data-driven \blue{Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)}
agents and traditional rule-based policies in order to strike the right balance
between performance and learning complexity. Our results confirm the
superiority of the proposed framework with respect to traditional stochastic
optimization-based approaches and provide key insights into the role and
interplay between data-driven DRL agents and new rule-based policies for both
efficient and high-performance control of latency-critical services.

Abstract: The integration of LLMs into software engineering has catalyzed a paradigm
shift from traditional rule-based systems to sophisticated agentic systems
capable of autonomous problem-solving. Despite this transformation, the field
lacks a comprehensive understanding of how benchmarks and solutions
interconnect, hindering systematic progress and evaluation. This survey
presents the first holistic analysis of LLM-empowered software engineering,
bridging the critical gap between evaluation and solution approaches. We
analyze 150+ recent papers and organize them into a comprehensive taxonomy
spanning two major dimensions: (1) Solutions, categorized into prompt-based,
fine-tuning-based, and agent-based paradigms, and (2) Benchmarks, covering code
generation, translation, repair, and other tasks. Our analysis reveals how the
field has evolved from simple prompt engineering to complex agentic systems
incorporating planning and decomposition, reasoning and self-refinement, memory
mechanisms, and tool augmentation. We present a unified pipeline that
illustrates the complete workflow from task specification to final
deliverables, demonstrating how different solution paradigms address varying
complexity levels across software engineering tasks. Unlike existing surveys
that focus on isolated aspects, we provide full-spectrum coverage connecting
50+ benchmarks with their corresponding solution strategies, enabling
researchers to identify optimal approaches for specific evaluation criteria.
Furthermore, we identify critical research gaps and propose actionable future
directions, including multi-agent collaboration frameworks, self-evolving code
generation systems, and integration of formal verification with LLM-based
methods. This survey serves as a foundational resource for researchers and
practitioners seeking to understand, evaluate, and advance LLM-empowered
software engineering systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly capable of generating complete
applications from natural language instructions, creating new opportunities in
science and education. In these domains, interactive scientific demonstrations
are particularly valuable for explaining concepts, supporting new teaching
methods, and presenting research findings. Generating such demonstrations
requires models to combine accurate scientific knowledge with the ability to
implement interactive front-end code that behaves correctly and responds to
user actions. This capability goes beyond the scope of existing benchmarks,
which typically evaluate either knowledge question answering without grounding
in code or static web code generation without scientific interactivity. To
evaluate this integrated ability, we design a hybrid framework that combines
programmatic functional testing to rigorously verify interaction logic with
visually-grounded qualitative testing to assess rendered outputs against
reference snapshots. Building on this framework, we present InteractScience, a
benchmark consisting of a substantial set of carefully designed questions
across five scientific domains, each paired with unit tests, reference
snapshots, and checklists. We evaluate 30 leading open- and closed-source LLMs
and report results that highlight ongoing weaknesses in integrating domain
knowledge with interactive front-end coding. Our work positions InteractScience
as the first benchmark to automatically measure this combined capability with
realistic interactive operations, providing a foundation for advancing reliable
and educationally useful scientific demonstration code generation. All code and
data are publicly available at https://github.com/open-compass/InteractScience.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Errors in floating-point programs can lead to severe consequences,
particularly in critical domains such as military, aerospace, and financial
systems, making their repair a crucial research problem. In practice, some
errors can be fixed using original-precision arithmetic, while others require
high-precision computation. Developers often avoid addressing the latter due to
excessive computational resources required. However, they sometimes struggle to
distinguish between these two types of errors, and existing repair tools fail
to assist in this differentiation. Most current repair tools rely on
high-precision implementations, which are time-consuming to develop and demand
specialized expertise. Although a few tools do not require high-precision
programs, they can only fix a limited subset of errors or produce suboptimal
results.
  To address these challenges, we propose a novel method, named OFP-Repair.On
ACESO's dataset, our patches achieve improvements of three, seven, three, and
eight orders of magnitude across four accuracy metrics. In real-world cases,
our method successfully detects all five original-precision-repairable errors
and fixes three, whereas ACESO only repairs one. Notably, these results are
based on verified data and do not fully capture the potential of OFP-Repair. To
further validate our method, we deploy it on a decade-old open bug report from
GNU Scientific Library (GSL), successfully repairing five out of 15 bugs. The
developers have expressed interest in our method and are considering
integrating our tool into their development workflow. We are currently working
on applying our patches to GSL. The results are highly encouraging,
demonstrating the practical applicability of our technique.

Abstract: Organizational efforts to utilize and operationalize artificial intelligence
(AI) are often accompanied by substantial challenges, including scalability,
maintenance, and coordination across teams. In response, the concept of Machine
Learning Operations (MLOps) has emerged as a set of best practices that
integrate software engineering principles with the unique demands of managing
the ML lifecycle. Yet, empirical evidence on whether and how these practices
support users in developing and operationalizing AI applications remains
limited. To address this gap, this study analyzes over 8,000 user reviews of AI
development platforms from G2.com. Using zero-shot classification, we measure
review sentiment toward nine established MLOps practices, including continuous
integration and delivery (CI/CD), workflow orchestration, reproducibility,
versioning, collaboration, and monitoring. Seven of the nine practices show a
significant positive relationship with user satisfaction, suggesting that
effective MLOps implementation contributes tangible value to AI development.
However, organizational context also matters: reviewers from small firms
discuss certain MLOps practices less frequently, suggesting that organizational
context influences the prevalence and salience of MLOps, though firm size does
not moderate the MLOps-satisfaction link. This indicates that once applied,
MLOps practices are perceived as universally beneficial across organizational
settings.

specialized infrastructure, SLEAN operates as a simple prompt bridge between
LLMs using .txt templates, requiring no deep technical knowledge for
deployment. The three-phase protocol formed by independent analysis,
cross-critique, and arbitration, filters harmful AI-generated code suggestions
before production deployment, addressing how AI-assisted debugging increasingly
produces modifications that introduce unnecessary complexity, break existing
functionality, or address problems. Evaluating 15 software bugs, we analyzed 69
AI-generated fix propositions. SLEAN's filtering accepted 22 fixes (31.9%, 95%
CI 20.9-42.9%) while rejecting 47 that would have been harmful if applied
verbatim. The arbitration process reduced code change surface by 83-90%
relative to raw AI outputs, enforcing minimal causal edits over scope-expanding
modifications. Minimal Type 2 inputs proved more efficient than detailed Type 1
inputs, requiring 2.85 versus 3.56 propositions per accepted fix (35.1% versus
28.1% acceptance, about a 20% efficiency gain). Agreement between AI systems
showed weak correlation with fix quality: high convergence (at least 80%)
occurred in 4 of 15 cases and improved acceptance by only 2.4% points;
arbitration appeared only at exactly 10% convergence in 2 of 15 cases, although
low convergence alone did not necessitate arbitration. The file-driven,
provider-agnostic architecture enables deployment without specialized coding
expertise, making it applicable to security auditing, code review, document
verification, and other domains requiring reliable multi-provider synthesis
with end-to-end auditability.

Abstract: JavaScript obfuscators are widely deployed to protect intellectual property
and resist reverse engineering, yet their correctness has been largely
overlooked compared to performance and resilience. Existing evaluations
typically measure resistance to deobfuscation, leaving the critical question of
whether obfuscators preserve program semantics unanswered. Incorrect
transformations can silently alter functionality, compromise reliability, and
erode security-undermining the very purpose of obfuscation. To address this
gap, we present OBsmith, a novel framework to systematically test JavaScript
obfuscators using large language models (LLMs). OBsmith leverages LLMs to
generate program sketches abstract templates capturing diverse language
constructs, idioms, and corner cases-which are instantiated into executable
programs and subjected to obfuscation under different configurations. Besides
LLM-powered sketching, OBsmith also employs a second source: automatic
extraction of sketches from real programs. This extraction path enables more
focused testing of project specific features and lets developers inject domain
knowledge into the resulting test cases. OBsmith uncovers 11 previously unknown
correctness bugs. Under an equal program budget, five general purpose
state-of-the-art JavaScript fuzzers (FuzzJIT, Jsfunfuzz, Superion, DIE,
Fuzzilli) failed to detect these issues, highlighting OBsmith's complementary
focus on obfuscation induced misbehavior. An ablation shows that all components
except our generic MRs contribute to at least one bug class; the negative MR
result suggests the need for obfuscator-specific metamorphic relations. Our
results also seed discussion on how to balance obfuscation presets and
performance cost. We envision OBsmith as an important step towards automated
testing and quality assurance of obfuscators and other semantic-preserving
toolchains.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Floating-point program errors can lead to severe consequences, particularly
in critical domains such as military applications. Only a small subset of
inputs may induce substantial floating-point errors, prompting researchers to
develop methods for identifying these error-inducing inputs. Although existing
approaches have achieved some success, they still suffer from two major
limitations: (1) High computational cost: The evaluation of error magnitude for
candidate inputs relies on high-precision programs, which are prohibitively
time-consuming. (2) Limited long-range convergence capability: Current methods
exhibit inefficiency in search, making the process akin to finding a needle in
a haystack.
  To address these two limitations, we propose a novel method, named MGDE, to
detect error-inducing inputs based on mathematical guidance. By employing the
Newton-Raphson method, which exhibits quadratic convergence properties, we
achieve highly effective and efficient results. Since the goal of identifying
error-inducing inputs is to uncover the underlying bugs, we use the number of
bugs detected in floating-point programs as the primary evaluation metric in
our experiments. As FPCC represents the most effective state-of-the-art
approach to date, we use it as the baseline for comparison. The dataset of FPCC
consists of 88 single-input floating-point programs. FPCC is able to detect 48
bugs across 29 programs, whereas our method successfully identifies 89 bugs
across 44 programs. Moreover, FPCC takes 6.4096 times as long as our proposed
method. We also deploy our method to multi-input programs, identifying a total
of nine bugs with an average detection time of 0.6443 seconds per program. In
contrast, FPCC fails to detect any bugs while requiring an average computation
time of 100 seconds per program.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The use of intrinsic functions to exploit hardware-specific capabilities is
an important approach for optimizing library performance. Many mainstream
libraries implement a large number of vectorized algorithms on Arm or x86 SIMD
intrinsic functions. With the rapid expansion of the RISC-V hardware-software
ecosystem, there is a growing demand for support of the RISC-V Vector (RVV)
extension. Translating existing vectorized intrinsic code onto RVV intrinsics
is a practical and effective approach. However, current cross-architecture
translation largely relies on manual rewriting, which is time-consuming and
error-prone. Furthermore, while some rule-based methods can reduce the need for
manual intervention, their translation success rate is limited by incomplete
rule coverage and syntactic constraints, and the performance suffers from
inadequate utilization of RVV-specific features. We present IntrinTrans, a
LLM-based multi-agent approach that utilizes compile-and-test feedback to
translate intrinsic code across architectures automatically, and further
optimizes the generated RVV intrinsics using register-usage information derived
from liveness analysis. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we
collected 34 vectorized algorithm cases from open-source libraries. Each case
includes an Arm Neon intrinsics implementation and a RVV intrinsics
implementation contributed by the open-source community, together with
correctness and performance tests. Our experiments show that advanced LLMs
produce semantically correct RISC-V Vector intrinsics in most cases within a
limited number of iterations, and in some cases achieve up to 5.93x the
performance of the native implementation from the open-source community.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have brought remarkable
progress in code understanding and reasoning, creating new opportunities and
raising new concerns for software security. Among many downstream tasks,
generating Proof-of-Concept (PoC) exploits plays a central role in
vulnerability reproduction, comprehension, and mitigation. While previous
research has focused primarily on zero-day exploitation, the growing
availability of rich public information accompanying disclosed CVEs leads to a
natural question: can LLMs effectively use this information to automatically
generate valid PoCs? In this paper, we present the first empirical study of
LLM-based PoC generation for web application vulnerabilities, focusing on the
practical feasibility of leveraging publicly disclosed information. We evaluate
GPT-4o and DeepSeek-R1 on 100 real-world and reproducible CVEs across three
stages of vulnerability disclosure: (1) newly disclosed vulnerabilities with
only descriptions, (2) 1-day vulnerabilities with patches, and (3) N-day
vulnerabilities with full contextual code. Our results show that LLMs can
automatically generate working PoCs in 8%-34% of cases using only public data,
with DeepSeek-R1 consistently outperforming GPT-4o. Further analysis shows that
supplementing code context improves success rates by 17%-20%, with
function-level providing 9%-13% improvement than file-level ones. Further
integrating adaptive reasoning strategies to prompt refinement significantly
improves success rates to 68%-72%. Our findings suggest that LLMs could reshape
vulnerability exploitation dynamics. To date, 23 newly generated PoCs have been
accepted by NVD and Exploit DB.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized
software testing, particularly fuzz testing, by automating the generation of
diverse and effective test inputs. This advancement holds great promise for
improving software reliability. Meanwhile, the introduction of MOJO, a
high-performance AI programming language blending Python's usability with the
efficiency of C and C++, presents new opportunities to enhance AI model
scalability and programmability. However, as a new language, MOJO lacks
comprehensive testing frameworks and a sufficient corpus for LLM-based testing,
which exacerbates model hallucination. In this case, LLMs will generate
syntactically valid but semantically incorrect code, significantly reducing the
effectiveness of fuzz testing. To address this challenge, we propose
MOJOFuzzer, the first adaptive LLM-based fuzzing framework designed for
zero-shot learning environments of emerging programming languages. MOJOFuzzer
integrates a mutil-phase framework that systematically eliminates low-quality
generated inputs before execution, significantly improving test case validity.
Furthermore, MOJOFuzzer dynamically adapts LLM prompts based on runtime
feedback for test case mutation, enabling an iterative learning process that
continuously enhances fuzzing efficiency and bug detection performance. Our
experimental results demonstrate that MOJOFuzzer significantly enhances test
validity, API coverage, and bug detection performance, outperforming
traditional fuzz testing and state-of-the-art LLM-based fuzzing approaches.
Using MOJOFuzzer, we have conducted a first large-scale fuzz testing evaluation
of MOJO, uncorvering 13 previous unknown bugs. This study not only advances the
field of LLM-driven software testing but also establishes a foundational
methodology for leveraging LLMs in the testing of emerging programming
languages.

Abstract: Automated code review adoption lags in compliance-heavy settings, where
static analyzers produce high-volume, low-rationale outputs, and naive LLM use
risks hallucination and incurring cost overhead. We present a production system
for grounded, PR-native review that pairs static-analysis findings with
AST-guided context extraction and a single-GPU, on-demand serving stack
(quantized open-weight model, multi-tier caching) to deliver concise
explanations and remediation guidance. Evaluated on safety-oriented C/C++
standards, the approach achieves sub-minute median first-feedback (offline p50
build+LLM 59.8s) while maintaining competitive violation reduction and lower
violation rates versus larger proprietary models. The architecture is
decoupled: teams can adopt the grounding/prompting layer or the serving layer
independently. A small internal survey (n=8) provides directional signals of
reduced triage effort and moderate perceived grounding, with participants
reporting fewer human review iterations. We outline operational lessons and
limitations, emphasizing reproducibility, auditability, and pathways to broader
standards and assisted patching.

Abstract: Capacity management is critical for software organizations to allocate
resources effectively and meet operational demands. An important step in
capacity management is predicting future resource needs often relies on
data-driven analytics and machine learning (ML) forecasting models, which
require frequent retraining to stay relevant as data evolves. Continuously
retraining the forecasting models can be expensive and difficult to scale,
posing a challenge for engineering teams tasked with balancing accuracy and
efficiency. Retraining only when the data changes appears to be a more
computationally efficient alternative, but its impact on accuracy requires
further investigation. In this work, we investigate the effects of retraining
capacity forecasting models for time series based on detected changes in the
data compared to periodic retraining. Our results show that drift-based
retraining achieves comparable forecasting accuracy to periodic retraining in
most cases, making it a cost-effective strategy. However, in cases where data
is changing rapidly, periodic retraining is still preferred to maximize the
forecasting accuracy. These findings offer actionable insights for software
teams to enhance forecasting systems, reducing retraining overhead while
maintaining robust performance.

Abstract: Software vulnerabilities remain a persistent risk, yet static and dynamic
analyses often overlook structural dependencies that shape insecure behaviors.
Viewing programs as heterogeneous graphs, we capture control- and data-flow
relations as complex interaction networks. Our hybrid framework combines these
graph representations with light-weight (<4B) local LLMs, uniting topological
features with semantic reasoning while avoiding the cost and privacy concerns
of large cloud models. Evaluated on Java vulnerability detection (binary
classification), our method achieves 93.57% accuracy-an 8.36% gain over Graph
Attention Network-based embeddings and 17.81% over pretrained LLM baselines
such as Qwen2.5 Coder 3B. Beyond accuracy, the approach extracts salient
subgraphs and generates natural language explanations, improving
interpretability for developers. These results pave the way for scalable,
explainable, and locally deployable tools that can shift vulnerability analysis
from purely syntactic checks to deeper structural and semantic insights,
facilitating broader adoption in real-world secure software development.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MASs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for automated
code generation, demonstrating impressive performance on established benchmarks
by decomposing complex coding tasks across specialized agents with different
roles. Despite their prosperous development and adoption, their robustness
remains pressingly under-explored, raising critical concerns for real-world
deployment. This paper presents the first comprehensive study examining the
robustness of MASs for code generation through a fuzzing-based testing
approach. By designing a fuzzing pipeline incorporating semantic-preserving
mutation operators and a novel fitness function, we assess mainstream MASs
across multiple datasets and LLMs. Our findings reveal substantial robustness
flaws of various popular MASs: they fail to solve 7.9%-83.3% of problems they
initially resolved successfully after applying the semantic-preserving
mutations. Through comprehensive failure analysis, we identify a common yet
largely overlooked cause of the robustness issue: miscommunications between
planning and coding agents, where plans lack sufficient detail and coding
agents misinterpret intricate logic, aligning with the challenges inherent in a
multi-stage information transformation process. Accordingly, we also propose a
repairing method that encompasses multi-prompt generation and introduces a new
monitor agent to address this issue. Evaluation shows that our repairing method
effectively enhances the robustness of MASs by solving 40.0%-88.9% of
identified failures. Our work uncovers critical robustness flaws in MASs and
provides effective mitigation strategies, contributing essential insights for
developing more reliable MASs for code generation.

Abstract: The integration of generative AI tools like ChatGPT into software engineering
workflows opens up new opportunities to boost productivity in tasks such as
unit test engineering. However, these AI-assisted workflows can also
significantly alter the developer's role, raising concerns about control,
output quality, and learning, particularly for novice developers. This study
investigates how novice software developers with foundational knowledge in
software testing interact with generative AI for engineering unit tests. Our
goal is to examine the strategies they use, how heavily they rely on generative
AI, and the benefits and challenges they perceive when using generative
AI-assisted approaches for test engineering. We conducted an observational
study involving 12 undergraduate students who worked with generative AI for
unit testing tasks. We identified four interaction strategies, defined by
whether the test idea or the test implementation originated from generative AI
or the participant. Additionally, we singled out prompting styles that focused
on one-shot or iterative test generation, which often aligned with the broader
interaction strategy. Students reported benefits including time-saving, reduced
cognitive load, and support for test ideation, but also noted drawbacks such as
diminished trust, test quality concerns, and lack of ownership. While strategy
and prompting styles influenced workflow dynamics, they did not significantly
affect test effectiveness or test code quality as measured by mutation score or
test smells.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Translating C code into safe Rust is an effective way to ensure its memory
safety. Compared to rule-based translation which produces Rust code that
remains largely unsafe, LLM-based methods can generate more idiomatic and safer
Rust code because LLMs have been trained on vast amount of human-written
idiomatic code. Although promising, existing LLM-based methods still struggle
with project-level C-to-Rust translation. They typically partition a C project
into smaller units (\eg{} functions) based on call graphs and translate them
bottom-up to resolve program dependencies. However, this bottom-up,
unit-by-unit paradigm often fails to translate pointers due to the lack of a
global perspective on their usage. To address this problem, we propose a novel
C-Rust Pointer Knowledge Graph (KG) that enriches a code-dependency graph with
two types of pointer semantics: (i) pointer-usage information which record
global behaviors such as points-to flows and map lower-level struct usage to
higher-level units; and (ii) Rust-oriented annotations which encode ownership,
mutability, nullability, and lifetime. Synthesizing the \kg{} with LLMs, we
further propose \ourtool{}, which implements a project-level C-to-Rust
translation technique. In \ourtool{}, the \kg{} provides LLMs with
comprehensive pointer semantics from a global perspective, thus guiding LLMs
towards generating safe and idiomatic Rust code from a given C project. Our
experiments show that \ourtool{} reduces unsafe usages in translated Rust by
99.9\% compared to both rule-based translation and traditional LLM-based
rewriting, while achieving an average 29.3\% higher functional correctness than
those fuzzing-enhanced LLM methods.

Abstract: Repository summarization is a crucial research question in development and

techniques primarily focus on summarizing code according to the directory tree,
which is insufficient for tracing high-level features to the methods that
collaboratively implement them. To address these limitations, we propose
RepoSummary, a feature-oriented code repository summarization approach that
simultaneously generates repository documentation automatically. Furthermore,
it establishes more accurate traceability links from functional features to the
corresponding code elements, enabling developers to rapidly locate relevant
methods and files during code comprehension and maintenance. Comprehensive
experiments against the state-of-the-art baseline (HGEN) demonstrate that
RepoSummary achieves higher feature coverage and more accurate traceability. On
average, it increases the rate of completely covered features in manual
documentation from 61.2% to 71.1%, improves file-level traceability recall from
29.9% to 53.0%, and generates documentation that is more conceptually
consistent, easier to understand, and better formatted than that produced by
existing approaches.

Abstract: Automated Program Repair (APR) plays a critical role in enhancing the quality

in Java-based APR, largely facilitated by benchmarks like Defects4J, there
remains a significant gap in research on C/C++ program repair, despite the
widespread use of C/C++ and the prevalence of associated vulnerabilities. This
gap is primarily due to the lack of high-quality, open-source benchmarks
tailored for C/C++.
  To address this issue, we introduce Defects4C, a comprehensive and executable
benchmark specifically designed for C/C++ program repair. Our dataset is
constructed from real-world C/C++ repositories and includes a large collection
of bug-relevant commits (9M in total), 248 high-quality buggy functions, and
102 vulnerable functions, all paired with test cases for reproduction. These
resources enable rigorous evaluation of repair techniques and support the
retraining of learning-based approaches for enhanced performance.
  Using Defects4C, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study evaluating the
effectiveness of 24 state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) in repairing
C/C++ faults. Our findings offer valuable insights into the strengths and
limitations of current LLM-based APR techniques in this domain, highlighting
both the need for more robust methods and the critical role of Defects4C in

Abstract: In programming education, Debugging and Teaching (DT) task is a common
scenario where students receive assistance in correcting their erroneous code.
The task involves multiple inputs, including erroneous code, error messages,
reference solutions, and the question description, with the goal of generating
modification suggestions to the erroneous code. However, two key challenges
hinder the effectiveness of existing approaches. Firstly, the complexity and
heterogeneity of inputs inherent in DT tasks significantly elevate the
reasoning challenges faced by LLMs. Second, existing approaches often fail to
fully leverage the availability of standard code in DT tasks, forcing models to
rely solely on complex multi-step reasoning, which limits the potential of LLMs
in addressing DT tasks effectively. To address these challenges, we propose
DebugTA, a novel LLM-based debugging and teaching agent with specialized tools
for standard code retrieval, variable substitution to align reference code, and
an external compiler for real-time code analysis. Guided by explicit
pedagogical and debugging principles, DebugTA acts as an agent that decomposes
a complex task into sequential LLM interactions, each utilizing distinct tools
for specific subtasks, thereby simplifying the logical reasoning at each step
and reducing overall reasoning complexity. Furthermore, DebugTA utilizes tool
calls to align the standard code with the erroneous code as much as possible,
allowing the LLM to focus on logic errors within the erroneous code and
improving the accuracy of the generated suggestions. To rigorously assess the
quality of modification suggestions, we introduce a student simulator-teacher
interaction paradigm. Experimental results on three real-world code datasets
demonstrate that DebugTA consistently improves teaching effectiveness while
significantly reducing computational costs.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs), such as OpenAI's GPT, are fundamentally transforming
the practice of software engineering by enabling the development of
\emph{FMware} -- applications and infrastructures built around these models.
FMware systems now support tasks such as code generation, natural-language
interaction, knowledge integration, and multi-modal content creation,
underscoring their disruptive impact on current software engineering workflows.
However, the design, implementation, and evolution of FMware present
significant new challenges, particularly across cloud-based and on-premise
platforms where goals, processes, and tools often diverge from those of
traditional software development.
  To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale analysis of FMware
development across both cloud-based platforms and open-source repositories. We
empirically investigate the FMware ecosystem through three focus areas: (1) the
most common application domains of FMware, (2) the key challenges developers
encounter, and (3) the types of issues that demand the greatest effort to
resolve. Our analysis draws on data from GitHub repositories and from leading
FMware platforms, including HuggingFace, GPTStore, Ora, and Poe. Our findings
reveal a strong focus on education, content creation, and business strategy,
alongside persistent technical challenges in memory management, dependency
handling, and tokenizer configuration. On GitHub, bug reports and core
functionality issues are the most frequently reported problems, while code
review, similarity search, and prompt template design are the most
time-consuming to resolve.
  By uncovering developer practices and pain points, this study points to
opportunities to improve FMware tools, workflows, and community support, and
provides actionable insights to help guide the future of FMware development.

Abstract: The observability framework Kieker provides a range of analysis capabilities,
but it is currently only able to instrument a smaller selection of languages
and technologies, including Java, C, Fortran, and Python. The OpenTelemetry
standard aims for providing reference implementations for most programming
languages, including C# and JavaScript, that are currently not supported by
Kieker. In this work, we describe how to transform OpenTelemetry tracing data
into the Kieker framework. Thereby, it becomes possible to create for example
call trees from OpenTelemetry instrumentations. We demonstrate the usability of
our approach by visualizing trace data of the Astronomy Shop, which is an
OpenTelemetry demo application.

Abstract: In GitHub with its 518 million hosted projects, performance changes within
these projects are highly relevant to the project's users. Although performance
measurement is supported by GitHub CI/CD, performance change detection is a
challenging topic.
  In this paper, we demonstrate how we incorporated Nyrki\"o to MooBench. Prior
to this work, Moobench continuously ran on GitHub virtual machines, measuring
overhead of tracing agents, but without change detection. By adding the upload
of the measurements to the Nyrki\"o change detection service, we made it
possible to detect performance changes. We identified one major performance
regression and examined the performance change in depth. We report that (1) it
is reproducible with GitHub actions, and (2) the performance regression is
caused by a Linux Kernel version change.

Abstract: The use of AI code-generation tools is becoming increasingly common, making
it important to understand how software developers are adopting these tools. In
this study, we investigate how developers engage with Amazon's CodeWhisperer,
an LLM-based code-generation tool. We conducted two user studies with two
groups of 10 participants each, interacting with CodeWhisperer - the first to
understand which interactions were critical to capture and the second to
collect low-level interaction data using a custom telemetry plugin. Our
mixed-methods analysis identified four behavioral patterns: 1) incremental code
refinement, 2) explicit instruction using natural language comments, 3)
baseline structuring with model suggestions, and 4) integrative use with
external sources. We provide a comprehensive analysis of these patterns .

Abstract: Understanding how developers interact with code generation tools (CGTs)
requires detailed, real-time data on programming behavior which is often
difficult to collect without disrupting workflow. We present
\textit{CodeWatcher}, a lightweight, unobtrusive client-server system designed
to capture fine-grained interaction events from within the Visual Studio Code
(VS Code) editor. \textit{CodeWatcher} logs semantically meaningful events such
as insertions made by CGTs, deletions, copy-paste actions, and focus shifts,
enabling continuous monitoring of developer activity without modifying user
workflows. The system comprises a VS Code plugin, a Python-based RESTful API,
and a MongoDB backend, all containerized for scalability and ease of
deployment. By structuring and timestamping each event, \textit{CodeWatcher}
enables post-hoc reconstruction of coding sessions and facilitates rich
behavioral analyses, including how and when CGTs are used during development.
This infrastructure is crucial for supporting research on responsible AI,
developer productivity, and the human-centered evaluation of CGTs. Please find

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: When learning to program, students are usually assessed based on the code
they wrote. However, the mere completion of a programming task does not
guarantee actual comprehension of the underlying concepts. Asking learners
questions about the code they wrote has therefore been proposed as a means to
assess program comprehension. As creating targeted questions for individual
student programs can be tedious and challenging, prior work has proposed to
generate such questions automatically. In this paper we generalize this idea to
the block-based programming language Scratch. We propose a set of 30 different
questions for Scratch code covering an established program comprehension model,
and extend the LitterBox static analysis tool to automatically generate
corresponding questions for a given Scratch program. On a dataset of 600,913
projects we generated 54,118,694 questions automatically. Our initial
experiments with 34 ninth graders demonstrate that this approach can indeed
generate meaningful questions for Scratch programs, and we find that the
ability of students to answer these questions on their programs relates to
their overall performance.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into biomedical
research workflows--from literature triage and hypothesis generation to
experimental design--yet this expanded utility also heightens dual-use
concerns, including the potential misuse for guiding toxic compound synthesis.
In response, this study shows a Biosecurity Agent that comprises four
coordinated modes across the model lifecycle: dataset sanitization, preference
alignment, run-time guardrails, and automated red teaming. For dataset
sanitization (Mode 1), evaluation is conducted on CORD-19, a COVID-19 Open
Research Dataset of coronavirus-related scholarly articles. We define three
sanitization tiers--L1 (compact, high-precision), L2 (human-curated biosafety
terms), and L3 (comprehensive union)--with removal rates rising from 0.46% to
70.40%, illustrating the safety-utility trade-off. For preference alignment
(Mode 2), DPO with LoRA adapters internalizes refusals and safe completions,
reducing end-to-end attack success rate (ASR) from 59.7% to 3.0%. At inference
(Mode 3), run-time guardrails across L1-L3 show the expected security-usability
trade-off: L2 achieves the best balance (F1 = 0.720, precision = 0.900, recall
= 0.600, FPR =0.067), while L3 offers stronger jailbreak resistance at the cost
of higher false positives. Under continuous automated red-teaming (Mode 4), no
successful jailbreaks are observed under the tested protocol. Taken together,
our biosecurity agent offers an auditable, lifecycle-aligned framework that
reduces attack success while preserving benign utility, providing safeguards
for the use of LLMs in scientific research and setting a precedent for future
agent-level security protections.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Industrial Control Systems (ICS) face growing cyber-physical attacks that
exploit both network vulnerabilities and physical processes. Current anomaly
detection methods rely on correlation-based analysis, which cannot separate
true causal relationships from spurious associations. This limitation results
in high false alarm rates and poor root cause analysis. We propose a novel
Causal Digital Twin (CDT) framework for cyber-physical security in medium-scale
ICS. Our method combines causal inference theory with digital twin modeling.
The framework enables three types of causal reasoning: association for pattern
detection, intervention for understanding system responses, and counterfactual
analysis for attack prevention planning. We evaluate our framework on three
industrial datasets: SWaT, WADI, and HAI, with validation through physical
constraint compliance (90.8\%) and synthetic ground truth testing (structural
Hamming distance 0.13). Results show significant improvements over seven
baseline methods. Our CDT achieves F1-scores are $0.944 \pm 0.014$ for SWaT,
$0.902 \pm 0.021$ for WADI, and $0.923 \pm 0.018$ for HAI with statistical
significance ($p < 0.0024$, Bonferroni corrected). The framework reduces false
positives by \SI{74}{\percent} and achieves \SI{78.4}{\percent} root cause
analysis accuracy compared to \SI{48.7}{\percent} for existing methods.
Counterfactual analysis enables defense strategies that reduce attack success
by \SI{73.2}{\percent}. The system keeps real-time performance with
\SI{3.2}{ms} latency, which is suitable for industrial deployment, while
providing interpretable explanations for operators.

Abstract: ChipmunkRing, a practical post-quantum ring signature construction tailored
for blockchain environments. Building on our Chipmunk lattice-based
cryptographic framework, this implementation delivers compact digital
signatures ranging from 20.5 to 279.7KB, with rapid signing operations
completing in 1.1-15.1ms and efficient validation processes requiring only
0.4-4.5ms for participant groups of 2-64 members. The cornerstone of our
approach is Acorn Verification-a streamlined zero-knowledge protocol that
supersedes the classical Fiat-Shamir methodology. This innovation enables
linear O(n) authentication complexity using concise 96-byte cryptographic
proofs per participant, yielding a remarkable 17.7x performance enhancement for
32-member rings when compared to conventional techniques. Our work includes
rigorous mathematical security demonstrations confirming 112-bit post-quantum
protection (NIST Level 1), extensive computational benchmarking, and
comprehensive support for both standard anonymity sets and collaborative
threshold constructions with flexible participation requirements.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We present a risk-calibrated approach to streaming intrusion detection that
couples Bayesian Online Changepoint Detection (BOCPD) with decision thresholds
aligned to Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) error budgets. BOCPD provides
run-length posteriors that adapt to distribution shift and concept drift; we
map these posteriors to alert decisions by optimizing expected operational cost
under false-positive and false-negative budgets. We detail the hazard model,
conjugate updates, and an O(1)-per-event implementation. A concrete SRE example
shows how a 99.9% availability SLO (43.2 minutes per month error budget) yields
a probability threshold near 0.91 when missed incidents are 10x more costly
than false alarms. We evaluate on the full UNSW-NB15 and CIC-IDS2017 benchmarks
with chronological splits, comparing against strong unsupervised baselines
(ECOD, COPOD, and LOF). Metrics include PR-AUC, ROC-AUC, Brier score,
calibration reliability diagrams, and detection latency measured in events.
Results indicate improved precision-recall at mid to high recall and better
probability calibration relative to baselines. We release implementation
details, hyperparameters, and ablations for hazard sensitivity and
computational footprint. Code and reproducibility materials will be made
available upon publication; datasets and implementation are available from the
corresponding author upon reasonable request.

Abstract: The excitement brought by the development of AI agents came alongside arising
problems. These concerns centered around users' trust issues towards AIs, the
risks involved, and the difficulty of attributing responsibilities and
liabilities. Current solutions only attempt to target each problem separately
without acknowledging their inter-influential nature. The Trust, Risk and
Liability (TRL) framework proposed in this paper, however, ties together the
interdependent relationships of trust, risk, and liability to provide a
systematic method of building and enhancing trust, analyzing and mitigating
risks, and allocating and attributing liabilities. It can be applied to analyze
any application scenarios of AI agents and suggest appropriate measures fitting
to the context. The implications of the TRL framework lie in its potential
societal impacts, economic impacts, ethical impacts, and more. It is expected
to bring remarkable values to addressing potential challenges and promoting
trustworthy, risk-free, and responsible usage of AI in 6G networks.

it bring a range of security and privacy threats, such as identity management,
data governance, and user interactions. This survey aims to provide a
comprehensive review of the enabling technologies for the Metaverse. It also
aims to provide a thorough analysis of key vulnerabilities and threats that may
compromise its sustainability and user safety. We perform a systematic
literature review (SLR) to identify key vulnerabilities and their
countermeasures in Metaverse platforms. Metaverse offers a much larger attack
surface compared to conventional digital platforms. Immersive, decentralized,
and permanent characteristics of the Metaverse generate new vulnerabilities.
Although there are many countermeasures to these vulnerabilities, most of them
are theoretical or have not been tested in real-world environments. Our review
highlights current advancements, identifies research gaps, and outlines future
directions to ensure a secure, resilient, and ethically governed Metaverse.

Abstract: With the proliferation of new blockchain-based cryptocurrencies/assets and
platforms that make it possible to transact across them, it becomes important
to consider not just whether the transfer of coins/assets can be tracked within
their respective transaction ledger, but also if they can be tracked as they
move across ledgers. This is especially important given that there are
documented cases of criminals attempting to use these cross-ledger trades to
obscure the flow of their coins/assets. In this paper, we perform a systematic
review of the various tracing techniques for blockchain transactions proposed
in literature, categorize them using multiple criteria (such as tracing
approach and targeted objective) and compare them. Based on the above
categorization, we provide insights on the state of blockchain transaction
tracing literature and identify the limitations of existing approaches.
Finally, we suggest directions for future research in this area based on our
analysis.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The growing use of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies in Nigerian
healthcare offers potential improvements in remote monitoring and data-driven
care, but unsecured wireless communication in medical IoT (mIoT) devices
exposes patient data to cyber threats. This study investigates such
vulnerabilities through a real-time Man in the Middle (MITM) attack simulation
and evaluates lightweight AES-128 encryption on low-cost devices.
  A prototype mIoT device was built with a NodeMCU ESP8266 and sensors for
heart rate and temperature. In controlled lab conditions simulating local
healthcare networks, unencrypted data transmissions were intercepted and
altered using common tools (Bettercap, Wireshark). After AES-128 encryption was
applied, all transmissions became unreadable and tamper attempts failed,
demonstrating its effectiveness.
  Performance costs were modest, latency rose from 80 ms to 125 ms (56.25
percent increase) and CPU use from 30 percent to 45 percent, but system
stability remained intact. Device cost stayed under 18,000 NGN (about 12 USD),
making it feasible for Nigeria's resource constrained facilities.
  A survey of healthcare professionals showed moderate awareness of IoT-related
risks but strong support for encryption and staff training. Barriers included
limited budgets and technical complexity.
  The study concludes that lightweight AES-128 encryption provides practical,
low-cost protection against common attack vectors while maintaining operational
efficiency. Feedback from professionals highlights the urgency of improving
security awareness and establishing guidelines for clinical deployment.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Hound introduces a relation-first graph engine that improves system-level
reasoning across interrelated components in complex codebases. The agent
designs flexible, analyst-defined views with compact annotations (e.g.,
monetary/value flows, authentication/authorization roles, call graphs, protocol
invariants) and uses them to anchor exact retrieval: for any question, it loads
precisely the code that matters (often across components) so it can zoom out to
system structure and zoom in to the decisive lines. A second contribution is a
persistent belief system: long-lived vulnerability hypotheses whose confidence
is updated as evidence accrues. The agent employs coverage-versus-intuition
planning and a QA finalizer to confirm or reject hypotheses. On a five-project
subset of ScaBench[1], Hound improves recall and F1 over a baseline LLM
analyzer (micro recall 31.2% vs. 8.3%; F1 14.2% vs. 9.8%) with a modest
precision trade-off. We attribute these gains to flexible, relation-first
graphs that extend model understanding beyond call/dataflow to abstract
aspects, plus the hypothesis-centric loop; code and artifacts are released to
support reproduction.

Abstract: This paper presents the Cybersecurity Psychology Framework (CPF), a novel
methodology for quantifying human-centric vulnerabilities in security
operations through systematic integration of established psychological
constructs with operational security telemetry. While individual human
factors-alert fatigue, compliance fatigue, cognitive overload, and risk
perception biases-have been extensively studied in isolation, no framework
provides end-to-end operationalization across the full spectrum of
psychological vulnerabilities. We address this gap by: (1) defining specific,
measurable algorithms that quantify key psychological states using standard SOC
tooling (SIEM, ticketing systems, communication platforms); (2) proposing a
lightweight, privacy-preserving LLM architecture based on Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) and domain-specific fine-tuning to analyze structured and
unstructured data for latent psychological risks; (3) detailing a rigorous
mixed-methods validation strategy acknowledging the inherent difficulty of
obtaining sensitive cybersecurity data. Our implementation of CPF indicators
has been demonstrated in a proof-of-concept deployment using small language
models achieving 0.92 F1-score on synthetic data. This work provides the
theoretical and methodological foundation necessary for industry partnerships
to conduct empirical validation with real operational data.

Abstract: Pingmark defines a universal textual protocol for expressing spatial context
through a minimal symbol: !@. Rather than embedding coordinates or using
proprietary map links, Pingmark introduces a semantic trigger that compliant
client applications interpret to generate a standardized resolver link of the
form https://pingmark.me/lat/lon/[timestamp]. This allows location expression
to function like existing textual conventions - @ for identity or # for topics
- but for physical space. The protocol requires no user registration, relies on
open mapping technologies, and protects privacy by generating location data
ephemerally and locally. This paper presents the motivation, syntax, and design
of the Pingmark Protocol Specification (PPS v0.1), its reference resolver
implementation, and the long-term goal of establishing Pingmark as an open
Internet standard for spatial mentions.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Password security has been compelled to evolve in response to the growing
computational capabilities of modern systems. However, this evolution has often
resulted in increasingly complex security practices that alienate users,
leading to poor compliance and heightened vulnerability. Consequently,
individuals remain exposed to attackers through weak or improperly managed
passwords, underscoring the urgent need for a comprehensive defense mechanism
that effectively addresses password-related risks and threats. In this paper,
we propose a multifaceted solution designed to revolutionize password security
by integrating diverse attributes such as the Password Dissection Mechanism,
Dynamic Password Policy Mechanism, human behavioral patterns, device
characteristics, network parameters, geographical context, and other relevant
factors. By leveraging learning-based models, our framework constructs detailed
user profiles capable of recognizing individuals and preventing nearly all
forms of unauthorized access or device possession. The proposed framework
enhances the usability-security paradigm by offering stronger protection than
existing standards while simultaneously engaging users in the policy-setting
process through a novel, adaptive approach.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: With the proliferation of decentralized applications (DApps), the conflict
between the transparency of blockchain technology and user data privacy has
become increasingly prominent. While Decentralized Identity (DID) and
Verifiable Credentials (VCs) provide a standardized framework for user data
sovereignty, achieving trusted identity verification and data sharing without
compromising privacy remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a
novel, comprehensive framework that integrates DIDs and VCs with efficient
Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) schemes to address this core issue. The key
contributions of this framework are threefold: first, it constructs a set of
strong privacy-preserving protocols based on zk-STARKs, allowing users to prove
that their credentials satisfy specific conditions (e.g., "age is over 18")
without revealing any underlying sensitive data. Second, it designs a scalable,
privacy-preserving credential revocation mechanism based on cryptographic
accumulators, effectively solving credential management challenges in
large-scale scenarios. Finally, it integrates a practical social key recovery
scheme, significantly enhancing system usability and security. Through a
prototype implementation and performance evaluation, this paper quantitatively
analyzes the framework's performance in terms of proof generation time,
verification overhead, and on-chain costs. Compared to existing
state-of-the-art systems based on zk-SNARKs, our framework, at the cost of a
larger proof size, significantly improves prover efficiency for complex
computations and provides stronger security guarantees, including no trusted
setup and post-quantum security. Finally, a case study in the decentralized
finance (DeFi) credit scoring scenario demonstrates the framework's immense
potential for unlocking capital efficiency and fostering a trusted data
economy.

conventional backdoor attacks relying on training data poisoning or model
training manipulation, QuRA solely works using the quantization operations. In
particular, QuRA first employs a novel weight selection strategy to identify
critical weights that influence the backdoor target (with the goal of
perserving the model's overall performance in mind). Then, by optimizing the
rounding direction of these weights, we amplify the backdoor effect across
model layers without degrading accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
QuRA achieves nearly 100% attack success rates in most cases, with negligible
performance degradation. Furthermore, we show that QuRA can adapt to bypass
existing backdoor defenses, underscoring its threat potential. Our findings
highlight critical vulnerability in widely used model quantization process,
emphasizing the need for more robust security measures. Our implementation is
available at https://github.com/cxx122/QuRA.

Abstract: We address the problem of auditing whether sensitive or copyrighted texts
were used to fine-tune large language models (LLMs) under black-box access.
Prior signals-verbatim regurgitation and membership inference-are unreliable at
the level of individual documents or require altering the visible text. We
introduce a text-preserving watermarking framework that embeds sequences of
invisible Unicode characters into documents. Each watermark is split into a cue
(embedded in odd chunks) and a reply (embedded in even chunks). At audit time,
we submit prompts that contain only the cue; the presence of the corresponding
reply in the model's output provides evidence of memorization consistent with
training on the marked text. To obtain sound decisions, we compare the score of
the published watermark against a held-out set of counterfactual watermarks and
apply a ranking test with a provable false-positive-rate bound. The design is
(i) minimally invasive (no visible text changes), (ii) scalable to many users
and documents via a large watermark space and multi-watermark attribution, and
(iii) robust to common passive transformations. We evaluate on open-weight LLMs
and multiple text domains, analyzing regurgitation dynamics, sensitivity to
training set size, and interference under multiple concurrent watermarks. Our
results demonstrate reliable post-hoc provenance signals with bounded FPR under
black-box access. We experimentally observe a failure rate of less than 0.1\%
when detecting a reply after fine-tuning with 50 marked documents. Conversely,
no spurious reply was recovered in over 18,000 challenges, corresponding to a
100\%TPR@0\% FPR. Moreover, detection rates remain relatively stable as the
dataset size increases, maintaining a per-document detection rate above 45\%
even when the marked collection accounts for less than 0.33\% of the
fine-tuning data.

Abstract: The proliferation of high-fidelity synthetic media, coupled with exploitable
hardware vulnerabilities in conventional imaging pipelines, has precipitated a
crisis of trust in digital content. Existing countermeasures, from post-hoc
classifiers to software-based signing, fail to address the fundamental
challenge of establishing an unbreakable link to reality at the moment of
capture. This whitepaper introduces Signing Right Away (SRA), a comprehensive
security architecture that guarantees the provenance of digital media from
"silicon to silicon to signed file." SRA leverages a four-pillar security
model-Confidentiality, Integrity, Authentication, and Replay Protection, akin
to the MIPI Camera Security Framework (CSF), but also extends its scope beyond
the internal data bus to the creation of a cryptographically sealed,
C2PA-compliant final asset. By securing the entire imaging pipeline within a
Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), SRA ensures that every captured image and
video carries an immutable, verifiable proof of origin. This provides a
foundational solution for industries reliant on trustworthy visual information,
including journalism, legal evidence, and insurance. We present the SRA
architecture, a detailed implementation roadmap informed by empirical
prototyping, and a comparative analysis that positions SRA as the essential
"last mile" in the chain of content trust.

Abstract: Radio Frequency Fingerprinting (RFF) has evolved as an effective solution for
authenticating devices by leveraging the unique imperfections in hardware
components involved in the signal generation process. In this work, we propose
a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based framework for detecting rogue
devices and identifying genuine ones using softmax probability thresholding. We
emulate an attack scenario in which adversaries attempt to mimic the RF
characteristics of genuine devices by training a Generative Adversarial Network
(GAN) using In-phase and Quadrature (IQ) samples from genuine devices. The
proposed approach is verified using IQ samples collected from ten different
ADALM-PLUTO Software Defined Radios (SDRs), with seven devices considered
genuine, two as rogue, and one used for validation to determine the threshold.

Abstract: Software-Defined Vehicles (SDVs) introduce innovative features that extend
the vehicle's lifecycle through the integration of outsourced applications and
continuous Over-The-Air (OTA) updates. This shift necessitates robust
cybersecurity and system resilience. While research on Connected and Autonomous
Vehicles (CAV) has been extensive, there is a lack of clarity in distinguishing
SDVs from non-SDVs and a need to consolidate cybersecurity research. SDVs, with
their extensive connectivity, have a broader attack surface. Besides, their
software-centric nature introduces additional vulnerabilities. This paper
provides a comprehensive examination of SDVs, detailing their ecosystem,
enabling technologies, and the principal cyberattack entry points that arise
from their architectural and operational characteristics. We also introduce a
novel, layered taxonomy that maps concrete exploit techniques onto core SDV
properties and attack paths, and use it to analyze representative studies and
experimental approaches.

Abstract: The code generation capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have
transformed the field of software development. However, this advancement also
presents significant security challenges, as LLM-generated code often contains
vulnerabilities. One direction of research strengthens LLMs by injecting or
refining security knowledge through curated datasets, model tuning, or static
analyzers. While effective in certain settings, these methods can be
resource-intensive, less adaptable to zero-day vulnerabilities, and often
inapplicable to proprietary models. To address these challenges, we introduce
GRASP, which explores a new direction that focuses on structured reasoning over
Secure Coding Practices(SCPs) rather than additional training or external
feedback. GRASP comprises two key ideas: (1) an SCP graph that organizes SCPs
into a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) capturing dependencies and relationships,
and (2) a graph-based reasoning process that systematically guides LLMs through
relevant SCPs for code generation. This design enables interpretable,
model-agnostic, and scalable security improvements, particularly for previously
unseen vulnerabilities. Our evaluation shows that GRASP consistently achieves
Security Rates (SR) exceeding 80% across multiple LLMs, and delivers up to 88%
improvements over baselines on zero-day vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at tasks such as dialogue, summarization,
and question answering, yet they struggle to adapt to specialized domains and
evolving facts. To overcome this, web search has been integrated into LLMs,
allowing real-time access to online content. However, this connection magnifies
safety risks, as adversarial prompts combined with untrusted sources can cause
severe vulnerabilities. We investigate red teaming for LLMs with web search and
present CREST-Search, a framework that systematically exposes risks in such
systems. Unlike existing methods for standalone LLMs, CREST-Search addresses
the complex workflow of search-enabled models by generating adversarial queries
with in-context learning and refining them through iterative feedback. We
further construct WebSearch-Harm, a search-specific dataset to fine-tune LLMs
into efficient red-teaming agents. Experiments show that CREST-Search
effectively bypasses safety filters and reveals vulnerabilities in modern
web-augmented LLMs, underscoring the need for specialized defenses to ensure
trustworthy deployment.

Abstract: Cloud computing has become the foundation of modern digital infrastructure,
yet the absence of a unified architectural and compliance framework impedes
interoperability, auditability, and robust security. This paper introduces a
formal, machine-readable semantic model for Cloud Engines, integrating the
architectural taxonomy of ISO/IEC 22123 (Cloud Reference Architecture) with the
security and compliance controls of ISO/IEC 27001:2022 and ISO/IEC TR
3445:2022. The model decomposes cloud systems into four canonical
interfaces--Control, Business, Audit, and Data--and extends them with a
security ontology that maps mechanisms such as authentication, authorization,
and encryption to specific compliance controls. Expressed in RDF/Turtle, the
model enables semantic reasoning, automated compliance validation, and
vendor-neutral architecture design. We demonstrate its practical utility
through OpenStack and AWS case studies, and provide reproducible validation
workflows using SPARQL and SHACL. This work advances the state of cloud
security modeling by bridging architectural and compliance standards in a
unified framework, with a particular emphasis on auditability.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have garnered significant attention for their
remarkable ability to interpret and generate multimodal content. However,
securing these models against jailbreak attacks continues to be a substantial
challenge. Unlike text-only models, VLMs integrate additional modalities,
introducing novel vulnerabilities such as image hijacking, which can manipulate
the model into producing inappropriate or harmful responses. Drawing
inspiration from text-based jailbreaks like the "Do Anything Now" (DAN)
command, this work introduces VisualDAN, a single adversarial image embedded
with DAN-style commands. Specifically, we prepend harmful corpora with
affirmative prefixes (e.g., "Sure, I can provide the guidance you need") to
trick the model into responding positively to malicious queries. The
adversarial image is then trained on these DAN-inspired harmful texts and
transformed into the text domain to elicit malicious outputs. Extensive
experiments on models such as MiniGPT-4, MiniGPT-v2, InstructBLIP, and LLaVA
reveal that VisualDAN effectively bypasses the safeguards of aligned VLMs,
forcing them to execute a broad range of harmful instructions that severely
violate ethical standards. Our results further demonstrate that even a small
amount of toxic content can significantly amplify harmful outputs once the
model's defenses are compromised. These findings highlight the urgent need for
robust defenses against image-based attacks and offer critical insights for
future research into the alignment and security of VLMs.

We review existing techniques, e.g., network traffic analysis or machine

home environments characterized by resource-constrained devices, dynamic usage
patterns, and privacy requirements. Furthermore, we discuss fingerprinting
system deployment challenges like scalability, interoperability, and energy
efficiency, as well as emerging opportunities enabled by generative AI and
federated learning. Finally, we outline open research directions that can
advance reliable and privacy-preserving fingerprinting for next-generation
smart home ecosystems.

Abstract: The open radio access network (O-RAN) enables modular, intelligent, and
programmable 5G network architectures through the adoption of software-defined
networking, network function virtualization, and implementation of standardized
open interfaces. However, one of the security concerns for O-RAN, which can
severely undermine network performance, is jamming attacks. This paper presents
SAJD- a self-adaptive jammer detection framework that autonomously detects
jamming attacks in AI/ML framework-integrated ORAN environments without human
intervention. The SAJD framework forms a closed-loop system that includes
near-realtime inference of radio signal jamming via our developed ML-based
xApp, as well as continuous monitoring and retraining pipelines through rApps.
In this demonstration, we will show how SAJD outperforms state-of-the-art
jamming detection xApp (offline trained with manual labels) in terms of
accuracy and adaptability under various dynamic and previously unseen
interference scenarios in the O-RAN-compliant testbed.

Abstract: Proof of Work (PoW) is widely regarded as the most secure permissionless
blockchain consensus protocol. However, its reliance on computationally
intensive yet externally useless puzzles results in excessive electric energy
wasting. To alleviate this, Proof of Useful Work (PoUW) has been explored as an
alternative to secure blockchain platforms while also producing real-world
value. Despite this promise, existing PoUW proposals often fail to embed the
integrity of the chain and identity of the miner into the puzzle solutions, not
meeting necessary requirements for PoW and thus rendering them vulnerable. In
this work, we propose a PoUW consensus protocol that computes client-outsourced
zk-SNARKs proofs as a byproduct, which are at the same time used to secure the
consensus protocol. We further leverage this mechanism to design a
decentralized marketplace for outsourcing zk-SNARK proof generation, which is,
to the best of our knowledge, the first such marketplace operating at the
consensus layer, while meeting all necessary properties of PoW.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Secret-key generation and agreement based on wireless channel reciprocity
offers a promising avenue for securing IoT networks. However, existing
approaches predominantly rely on the similarity of instantaneous channel
measurement samples between communicating devices. This narrow view of
reciprocity is often impractical, as it is highly susceptible to noise,
asynchronous sampling, channel fading, and other system-level imperfections --
all of which significantly impair key generation performance. Furthermore, the
quantization step common in traditional schemes introduces irreversible errors,
further limiting efficiency. In this work, we propose a novel approach for
secret-key generation by using wavelet scattering networks to extract robust
and reciprocal CSI features. Dimensionality reduction is applied to uncover
hidden cluster structures, which are then used to build hidden Markov models
for efficient key agreement. Our approach eliminates the need for quantization
and effectively captures channel randomness. It achieves a 5x improvement in
key generation rate compared to traditional benchmarks, providing a secure and
efficient solution for key generation in resource-constrained IoT environments.

Abstract: GraphQL's flexible query model and nested data dependencies expose APIs to
complex, context-dependent vulnerabilities that are difficult to uncover using
conventional testing tools. Existing fuzzers either rely on random payload
generation or rigid mutation heuristics, failing to adapt to the dynamic
structures of GraphQL schemas and responses. We present PrediQL, the first
retrieval-augmented, LLM-guided fuzzer for GraphQL APIs. PrediQL combines large
language model reasoning with adaptive feedback loops to generate semantically
valid and diverse queries. It models the choice of fuzzing strategy as a
multi-armed bandit problem, balancing exploration of new query structures with
exploitation of past successes. To enhance efficiency, PrediQL retrieves and
reuses execution traces, schema fragments, and prior errors, enabling
self-correction and progressive learning across test iterations. Beyond input
generation, PrediQL integrates a context-aware vulnerability detector that uses
LLM reasoning to analyze responses, interpreting data values, error messages,
and status codes to identify issues such as injection flaws, access-control
bypasses, and information disclosure. Our evaluation across open-source and
benchmark GraphQL APIs shows that PrediQL achieves significantly higher
coverage and vulnerability discovery rates compared to state-of-the-art
baselines. These results demonstrate that combining retrieval-augmented
reasoning with adaptive fuzzing can transform API security testing from
reactive enumeration to intelligent exploration.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Contemporary web application architectures involve many layers of proxy
services that process traffic. Due to the complexity of HTTP and vendor design
decisions, these proxies sometimes process a given request in different ways.
Attackers can exploit these processing discrepancies to launch damaging attacks
including web cache poisoning and request smuggling. Discrepancy attacks are
surging, yet, there exists no systemic defense.
  In this work, we propose the first comprehensive defense to address this
problem, called HTTP Request Synchronization. Our scheme uses standard HTTP
extension mechanisms to augment each request with a complete processing
history. It propagates this context through the traffic path detailing how each
server hop has processed said request. Using this history, every proxy server
can validate that their processing is consistent with all previous hops,
eliminating discrepancy attacks. We implement our scheme for 5 popular proxy
technologies, Apache, NGINX, HAProxy, Varnish, and Cloudflare, demonstrating
its practical impact.

Abstract: Machine learning has become a crucial part of our lives, with applications
spanning nearly every aspect of our daily activities. However, using personal
information in machine learning applications has sparked significant security
and privacy concerns about user data. To address these challenges, different
privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML) frameworks have been developed to
protect sensitive information in machine learning applications. These
frameworks generally attempt to balance design trade-offs such as computational
efficiency, communication overhead, security guarantees, and scalability.
Despite the advancements, selecting the optimal framework and parameters for
specific deployment scenarios remains a complex and critical challenge for
privacy and security application developers.
  We present Prismo, an open-source recommendation system designed to aid in
selecting optimal parameters and frameworks for different PPML application
scenarios. Prismo enables users to explore a comprehensive space of PPML
frameworks through various properties based on user-defined objectives. It
supports automated filtering of suitable candidate frameworks by considering
parameters such as the number of parties in multi-party computation or
federated learning and computation cost constraints in homomorphic encryption.
Prismo models every use case into a Linear Integer Programming optimization
problem, ensuring tailored solutions are recommended for each scenario. We
evaluate Prismo's effectiveness through multiple use cases, demonstrating its
ability to deliver best-fit solutions in different deployment scenarios.

Abstract: Large vision-language model (LVLM)-based web agents are emerging as powerful
tools for automating complex online tasks. However, when deployed in real-world
environments, they face serious security risks, motivating the design of
security evaluation benchmarks. Existing benchmarks provide only partial
coverage, typically restricted to narrow scenarios such as user-level prompt
manipulation, and thus fail to capture the broad range of agent
vulnerabilities. To address this gap, we present \tool{}, the first holistic
benchmark for evaluating the security of LVLM-based web agents. \tool{} first
introduces a unified evaluation suite comprising six simulated but realistic
web environments (\eg, e-commerce platforms, community forums) and includes
2,970 high-quality trajectories spanning diverse tasks and attack settings. The
suite defines a structured taxonomy of six attack vectors spanning both
user-level and environment-level manipulations. In addition, we introduce a
multi-layered evaluation protocol that analyzes agent failures across three
critical dimensions: internal reasoning, behavioral trajectory, and task
outcome, facilitating a fine-grained risk analysis that goes far beyond simple
success metrics. Using this benchmark, we conduct large-scale experiments on 9
representative LVLMs, which fall into three categories: general-purpose,
agent-specialized, and GUI-grounded. Our results show that all tested agents
are consistently vulnerable to subtle adversarial manipulations and reveal
critical trade-offs between model specialization and security. By providing (1)
a comprehensive benchmark suite with diverse environments and a multi-layered
evaluation pipeline, and (2) empirical insights into the security challenges of
modern LVLM-based web agents, \tool{} establishes a foundation for advancing
trustworthy web agent deployment.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Harmful fine-tuning issues present significant safety challenges for
fine-tuning-as-a-service in large language models. Existing alignment-stage
defenses, e.g., Vaccine, Repnoise, Booster, and T-Vaccine, mitigate harmful
fine-tuning issues by enhancing the model's robustness during the alignment
phase. While these methods have been proposed to mitigate the issue, they often
overlook a critical upstream factor: the role of the original safety-alignment
data. We observe that their defense performance and computational efficiency
remain constrained by the quality and composition of the alignment dataset. To
address this limitation, we propose Pharmacist, a safety alignment data
curation solution that enhances defense against harmful fine-tuning by
selecting a high-quality and safety-critical core subset from the original
alignment data. The core idea of Pharmacist is to train an alignment data
selector to rank alignment data. Specifically, up-ranking high-quality and
safety-critical alignment data, down-ranking low-quality and
non-safety-critical data. Empirical results indicate that models trained on
datasets selected by Pharmacist outperform those trained on datasets selected
by existing selection methods in both defense and inference performance. In
addition, Pharmacist can be effectively integrated with mainstream
alignment-stage defense methods. For example, when applied to RepNoise and
T-Vaccine, using the dataset selected by Pharmacist instead of the full dataset
leads to improvements in defense performance by 2.60\% and 3.30\%,
respectively, and enhances inference performance by 3.50\% and 1.10\%. Notably,
it reduces training time by 56.83\% and 57.63\%, respectively. Our code is

Abstract: System passwords serve as critical credentials for user authentication and
access control when logging into operating systems or applications. Upon
entering a valid password, users pass verification to access system resources
and execute corresponding operations. In recent years, frequent password
cracking attacks targeting system passwords have posed a severe threat to
information system security. To address this challenge, in-depth research into
password cracking attack methods and defensive technologies holds significant
importance. This paper conducts systematic research on system password
security, focusing on analyzing typical password cracking methods such as brute
force attacks, dictionary attacks, and rainbow table attacks, while evaluating
the effectiveness of existing defensive measures. The experimental section
utilizes common cryptanalysis tools, such as John the Ripper and Hashcat, to
simulate brute force and dictionary attacks. Five test datasets, each generated
using Message Digest Algorithm 5 (MD5), Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit (SHA
256), and bcrypt hash functions, are analyzed. By comparing the overall
performance of different hash algorithms and password complexity strategies
against these attacks, the effectiveness of defensive measures such as salting
and slow hashing algorithms is validated. Building upon this foundation, this
paper further evaluates widely adopted defense mechanisms, including account
lockout policies, multi-factor authentication, and risk adaptive
authentication. By integrating experimental data with recent research findings,
it analyzes the strengths and limitations of each approach while proposing
feasible improvement recommendations and optimization strategies.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Unlike regular tokens derived from existing text corpora, special tokens are
artificially created to annotate structured conversations during the
fine-tuning process of Large Language Models (LLMs). Serving as metadata of
training data, these tokens play a crucial role in instructing LLMs to generate
coherent and context-aware responses. We demonstrate that special tokens can be
exploited to construct four attack primitives, with which malicious users can
reliably bypass the internal safety alignment of online LLM services and
circumvent state-of-the-art (SOTA) external content moderation systems
simultaneously. Moreover, we found that addressing this threat is challenging,
as aggressive defense mechanisms-such as input sanitization by removing special
tokens entirely, as suggested in academia-are less effective than anticipated.
This is because such defense can be evaded when the special tokens are replaced
by regular ones with high semantic similarity within the tokenizer's embedding
space. We systemically evaluated our method, named MetaBreak, on both lab
environment and commercial LLM platforms. Our approach achieves jailbreak rates
comparable to SOTA prompt-engineering-based solutions when no content
moderation is deployed. However, when there is content moderation, MetaBreak
outperforms SOTA solutions PAP and GPTFuzzer by 11.6% and 34.8%, respectively.
Finally, since MetaBreak employs a fundamentally different strategy from prompt
engineering, the two approaches can work synergistically. Notably, empowering
MetaBreak on PAP and GPTFuzzer boosts jailbreak rates by 24.3% and 20.2%,
respectively.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into computer applications
has introduced transformative capabilities but also significant security
challenges. Existing safety alignments, which primarily focus on semantic
interpretation, leave LLMs vulnerable to attacks that use non-standard data
representations. This paper introduces ArtPerception, a novel black-box
jailbreak framework that strategically leverages ASCII art to bypass the
security measures of state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs. Unlike prior methods that
rely on iterative, brute-force attacks, ArtPerception introduces a systematic,
two-phase methodology. Phase 1 conducts a one-time, model-specific pre-test to
empirically determine the optimal parameters for ASCII art recognition. Phase 2
leverages these insights to launch a highly efficient, one-shot malicious
jailbreak attack. We propose a Modified Levenshtein Distance (MLD) metric for a
more nuanced evaluation of an LLM's recognition capability. Through
comprehensive experiments on four SOTA open-source LLMs, we demonstrate
superior jailbreak performance. We further validate our framework's real-world
relevance by showing its successful transferability to leading commercial
models, including GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 3.7, and DeepSeek-V3, and by conducting
a rigorous effectiveness analysis against potential defenses such as LLaMA
Guard and Azure's content filters. Our findings underscore that true LLM
security requires defending against a multi-modal space of interpretations,
even within text-only inputs, and highlight the effectiveness of strategic,
reconnaissance-based attacks. Content Warning: This paper includes potentially
harmful and offensive model outputs.

Abstract: Post-quantum cryptography (PQC) is moving from evaluation to deployment as
NIST finalizes standards for ML-KEM, ML-DSA, and SLH-DSA. This survey maps the
space from foundations to practice. We first develop a taxonomy across
lattice-, code-, hash-, multivariate-, isogeny-, and MPC-in-the-Head families,
summarizing security assumptions, cryptanalysis, and standardization status. We
then compare performance and communication costs using representative,
implementation-grounded measurements, and review hardware acceleration (AVX2,
FPGA/ASIC) and implementation security with a focus on side-channel resistance.
Building upward, we examine protocol integration (TLS, DNSSEC), PKI and
certificate hygiene, and deployment in constrained and high-assurance
environments (IoT, cloud, finance, blockchain). We also discuss complementarity
with quantum technologies (QKD, QRNGs) and the limits of near-term quantum
computing. Throughout, we emphasize crypto-agility, hybrid migration, and
evidence-based guidance for operators. We conclude with open problems spanning
parameter agility, leakage-resilient implementations, and domain-specific
rollout playbooks. This survey aims to be a practical reference for researchers
and practitioners planning quantum-safe systems, bridging standards,
engineering, and operations.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Open-source large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated considerable
dominance over proprietary LLMs in resolving neural processing tasks, thanks to
the collaborative and sharing nature. Although full access to source codes,
model parameters, and training data lays the groundwork for transparency, we
argue that such a full-access manner is vulnerable to stego attacks, and their
ill-effects are not fully understood. In this paper, we conduct a systematic
formalization for stego attacks on open-source LLMs by enumerating all possible
threat models associated with adversary objectives, knowledge, and
capabilities. Therein, the threat posed by adversaries with internal knowledge,
who inject payloads and triggers during the model sharing phase, is of
practical interest. We go even further and propose the first stego attack on
open-source LLMs, dubbed SASER, which wields impacts through identifying
targeted parameters, embedding payloads, injecting triggers, and executing
payloads sequentially. Particularly, SASER enhances the attack robustness
against quantization-based local deployment by de-quantizing the embedded
payloads. In addition, to achieve stealthiness, SASER devises the
performance-aware importance metric to identify targeted parameters with the
least degradation of model performance. Extensive experiments on LlaMA2-7B and
ChatGLM3-6B, without quantization, show that the stealth rate of SASER
outperforms existing stego attacks (for general DNNs) by up to 98.1%, while
achieving the same attack success rate (ASR) of 100%. More importantly, SASER
improves ASR on quantized models from 0 to 100% in all settings. We appeal for
investigations on countermeasures against SASER in view of the significant
attack effectiveness.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Is module-lattice reduction better than unstructured lattice reduction? This
question was highlighted as 'Q8' in the Kyber NIST standardization submission
(Avanzi et al., 2021), as potentially affecting the concrete security of Kyber
and other module-lattice-based schemes. Foundational works on module-lattice
reduction (Lee, Pellet-Mary, Stehl\'e, and Wallet, ASIACRYPT 2019; Mukherjee
and Stephens-Davidowitz, CRYPTO 2020) confirmed the existence of such module
variants of LLL and block-reduction algorithms, but focus only on provable
worst-case asymptotic behavior.
  In this work, we present a concrete average-case analysis of module-lattice
reduction. Specifically, we address the question of the expected slope after
running module-BKZ, and pinpoint the discriminant $\Delta_K$ of the number
field at hand as the main quantity driving this slope. We convert this back
into a gain or loss on the blocksize $\beta$: module-BKZ in a number field $K$
of degree $d$ requires an SVP oracle of dimension $\beta + \log(|\Delta_K| /
d^d)\beta /(d\log \beta) + o(\beta / \log \beta)$ to reach the same slope as
unstructured BKZ with blocksize $\beta$. This asymptotic summary hides further
terms that we predict concretely using experimentally verified heuristics.
Incidentally, we provide the first open-source implementation of module-BKZ for
some cyclotomic fields.
  For power-of-two cyclotomic fields, we have $|\Delta_K| = d^d$, and conclude
that module-BKZ requires a blocksize larger than its unstructured counterpart
by $d-1+o(1)$. On the contrary, for all other cyclotomic fields we have
$|\Delta_K| < d^d$, so module-BKZ provides a sublinear $\Theta(\beta/\log
\beta)$ gain on the required blocksize, yielding a subexponential speedup of
$\exp(\Theta(\beta/\log \beta))$.

Abstract: Decentralized communication is becoming an important use case within Web3. On
Ethereum, users can repurpose the transaction input data field to embed
natural-language messages, commonly known as Input Data Messages (IDMs).
However, as IDMs gain wider adoption, there has been a growing volume of toxic
content on-chain. This trend is concerning, as Ethereum provides no
protocol-level support for content moderation.
  We propose two moderation frameworks for Ethereum IDMs: (i) BUILDERMOD, where
builders perform semantic checks during block construction; and (ii) USERMOD,
where users proactively obtain moderation proofs from external classifiers and
embed them in transactions. Our evaluation reveals that BUILDERMOD incurs high
block-time overhead, which limits its practicality. In contrast, USERMOD
enables lower-latency validation and scales more effectively, making it a more
practical approach in moderation-aware Ethereum environments.
  Our study lays the groundwork for protocol-level content governance in
decentralized systems, and we hope it contributes to the development of a
decentralized communication environment that is safe, trustworthy, and socially
responsible.

Abstract: As autonomous vehicles become an essential component of modern
transportation, they are increasingly vulnerable to threats such as GPS
spoofing attacks. This study presents an adaptive detection approach utilizing
a dynamically tuned Density Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise
(DBSCAN) algorithm, designed to adjust the detection threshold ({\epsilon}) in
real-time. The threshold is updated based on the recursive mean and standard
deviation of displacement errors between GPS and in-vehicle sensors data, but
only at instances classified as non-anomalous. Furthermore, an initial
threshold, determined from 120,000 clean data samples, ensures the capability
to identify even subtle and gradual GPS spoofing attempts from the beginning.
To assess the performance of the proposed method, five different subsets from
the real-world Honda Research Institute Driving Dataset (HDD) are selected to
simulate both large and small magnitude GPS spoofing attacks. The modified
algorithm effectively identifies turn-by-turn, stop, overshoot, and multiple
small biased spoofing attacks, achieving detection accuracies of 98.621%,
99.960.1%, 99.880.1%, and 98.380.1%, respectively. This work provides a
substantial advancement in enhancing the security and safety of AVs against GPS
spoofing threats.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Classical linear ciphers, such as the Hill cipher, operate on fixed,
finite-dimensional modules and are therefore vulnerable to straightforward
known-plaintext attacks that recover the key as a fully determined linear
operator. We propose a symmetric-key cryptosystem whose linear action takes
place instead in the Burnside ring $A(G)$ of a compact Lie group $G$, with
emphasis on the case $G=O(2)$. The secret key consists of (i) a compact Lie
group $G$; (ii) a secret total ordering of the subgroup orbit-basis of $A(G)$;
and (iii) a finite set $S$ of indices of irreducible $G$-representations, whose
associated basic degrees define an involutory multiplier $k\in A(G)$. Messages
of arbitrary finite length are encoded as finitely supported elements of $A(G)$
and encrypted via the Burnside product with $k$. For $G=O(2)$ we prove that
encryption preserves plaintext support among the generators
$\{(D_1),\dots,(D_L),(SO(2)),(O(2))\}$, avoiding ciphertext expansion and
security leakage. We then analyze security in passive models, showing that any
finite set of observations constrains the action only on a finite-rank
submodule $W_L\subset A(O(2))$, and we show information-theoretic
non-identifiability of the key from such data. Finally, we prove the scheme is
\emph{not} IND-CPA secure, by presenting a one-query chosen-plaintext
distinguisher based on dihedral probes.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: With the growing deployment of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in
real-world embodied AI systems, their increasing vulnerability to backdoor
attacks poses a serious safety threat. A backdoored VLA agent can be covertly
triggered by a pre-injected backdoor to execute adversarial actions,
potentially causing system failures or even physical harm. Although backdoor
attacks on VLA models have been explored, prior work has focused only on
untargeted attacks, leaving the more practically threatening scenario of
targeted manipulation unexamined. In this paper, we study targeted backdoor
attacks on VLA models and introduce TabVLA, a novel framework that enables such
attacks via black-box fine-tuning. TabVLA explores two deployment-relevant
inference-time threat models: input-stream editing and in-scene triggering. It
formulates poisoned data generation as an optimization problem to improve
attack effectivess. Experiments with OpenVLA-7B on the LIBERO benchmark reveal
that the vision channel is the principal attack surface: targeted backdoors
succeed with minimal poisoning, remain robust across variations in trigger
design, and are degraded only by positional mismatches between fine-tuning and
inference triggers. We also investigate a potential detection-based defense
against TabVLA, which reconstructs latent visual triggers from the input stream
to flag activation-conditioned backdoor samples. Our work highlights the
vulnerability of VLA models to targeted backdoor manipulation and underscores
the need for more advanced defenses.

Abstract: The promise of LLM watermarking rests on a core assumption that a specific
watermark proves authorship by a specific model. We demonstrate that this
assumption is dangerously flawed. We introduce the threat of watermark
spoofing, a sophisticated attack that allows a malicious model to generate text
containing the authentic-looking watermark of a trusted, victim model. This
enables the seamless misattribution of harmful content, such as disinformation,
to reputable sources. The key to our attack is repurposing watermark
radioactivity, the unintended inheritance of data patterns during fine-tuning,
from a discoverable trait into an attack vector. By distilling knowledge from a
watermarked teacher model, our framework allows an attacker to steal and
replicate the watermarking signal of the victim model. This work reveals a
critical security gap in text authorship verification and calls for a paradigm
shift towards technologies capable of distinguishing authentic watermarks from
expertly imitated ones. Our code is available at

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Text data has become extremely valuable on large language models (LLMs) and
even lead to general artificial intelligence (AGI). A lot of high-quality text
in the real world is private and cannot be freely used due to privacy concerns.
Therefore, differentially private (DP) synthetic text generation has been
proposed, aiming to produce high-utility synthetic data while protecting
sensitive information. However, existing DP synthetic text generation imposes
uniform guarantees that often overprotect non-sensitive content, resulting in
substantial utility loss and computational overhead. Therefore, we propose
Secret-Protected Evolution (SecPE), a novel framework that extends private
evolution with secret-aware protection. Theoretically, we show that SecPE
satisfies $(\mathrm{p}, \mathrm{r})$-secret protection, constituting a
relaxation of Gaussian DP that enables tighter utility-privacy trade-offs,
while also substantially reducing computational complexity relative to baseline
methods. Empirically, across the OpenReview, PubMed, and Yelp benchmarks, SecPE
consistently achieves lower Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) and higher
downstream task accuracy than GDP-based Aug-PE baselines, while requiring less
noise to attain the same level of protection. Our results highlight that
secret-aware guarantees can unlock more practical and effective
privacy-preserving synthetic text generation.

Abstract: Dynamically distributed inflation is a common mechanism used to guide a
blockchain's staking rate towards a desired equilibrium between network
security and token liquidity.
  However, the high sensitivity of the annual percentage yield to changes in
the staking rate, coupled with the inherent feedback delays in staker
responses, can induce undesirable oscillations around this equilibrium.
  This paper investigates this instability phenomenon. We analyze the dynamics
of inflation-based reward systems and propose a novel distribution model
designed to stabilize the staking rate. Our solution effectively dampens
oscillations, stabilizing the yield within a target staking range.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Local Differential Privacy (LDP) addresses significant privacy concerns in
sensitive data collection. In this work, we focus on numerical data collection
under LDP, targeting a significant gap in the literature: existing LDP
mechanisms are optimized for either a very small ($|\Omega| \in \{2, 3\}$) or
infinite output spaces. However, no generalized method for constructing an
optimal mechanism for an arbitrary output size $N$ exists. To fill this gap, we
propose the \textbf{N-output mechanism}, a generalized framework that maps
numerical data to one of $N$ discrete outputs.
  We formulate the mechanism's design as an optimization problem to minimize
estimation variance for any given $N \geq 2$ and develop both numerical and
analytical solutions. This results in a mechanism that is highly accurate and
adaptive, as its design is determined by solving an optimization problem for
any chosen $N$. Furthermore, we extend our framework and existing mechanisms to
the task of distribution estimation. Empirical evaluations show that the
N-output mechanism achieves state-of-the-art accuracy for mean, variance, and
distribution estimation with small communication costs.

Abstract: Large language models have gained widespread attention recently, but their
potential security vulnerabilities, especially privacy leakage, are also
becoming apparent. To test and evaluate for data extraction risks in LLM, we
proposed CoSPED, short for Consistent Soft Prompt targeted data Extraction and
Defense. We introduce several innovative components, including Dynamic Loss,
Additive Loss, Common Loss, and Self Consistency Decoding Strategy, and tested
to enhance the consistency of the soft prompt tuning process. Through extensive
experimentation with various combinations, we achieved an extraction rate of
65.2% at a 50-token prefix comparison. Our comparisons of CoSPED with other
reference works confirm our superior extraction rates. We evaluate CoSPED on
more scenarios, achieving Pythia model extraction rate of 51.7% and introducing
cross-model comparison. Finally, we explore defense through Rank-One Model
Editing and achieve a reduction in the extraction rate to 1.6%, which proves
that our analysis of extraction mechanisms can directly inform effective
mitigation strategies against soft prompt-based attacks.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) increases the reliability and
trustworthiness of the LLM response and reduces hallucination by eliminating
the need for model retraining. It does so by adding external data into the
LLM's context. We develop a new class of black-box attack, RAG-Pull, that
inserts hidden UTF characters into queries or external code repositories,
redirecting retrieval toward malicious code, thereby breaking the models'
safety alignment. We observe that query and code perturbations alone can shift
retrieval toward attacker-controlled snippets, while combined query-and-target
perturbations achieve near-perfect success. Once retrieved, these snippets
introduce exploitable vulnerabilities such as remote code execution and SQL
injection. RAG-Pull's minimal perturbations can alter the model's safety
alignment and increase preference towards unsafe code, therefore opening up a
new class of attacks on LLMs.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: LLM-based agents have demonstrated promising adaptability in real-world
applications. However, these agents remain vulnerable to a wide range of
attacks, such as tool poisoning and malicious instructions, that compromise
their execution flow and can lead to serious consequences like data breaches
and financial loss. Existing studies typically attempt to mitigate such
anomalies by predefining specific rules and enforcing them at runtime to
enhance safety. Yet, designing comprehensive rules is difficult, requiring
extensive manual effort and still leaving gaps that result in false negatives.
As agent systems evolve into complex software systems, we take inspiration from
software system security and propose TraceAegis, a provenance-based analysis
framework that leverages agent execution traces to detect potential anomalies.
In particular, TraceAegis constructs a hierarchical structure to abstract
stable execution units that characterize normal agent behaviors. These units
are then summarized into constrained behavioral rules that specify the
conditions necessary to complete a task. By validating execution traces against
both hierarchical and behavioral constraints, TraceAegis is able to effectively
detect abnormal behaviors. To evaluate the effectiveness of TraceAegis, we
introduce TraceAegis-Bench, a dataset covering two representative scenarios:
healthcare and corporate procurement. Each scenario includes 1,300 benign
behaviors and 300 abnormal behaviors, where the anomalies either violate the
agent's execution order or break the semantic consistency of its execution
sequence. Experimental results demonstrate that TraceAegis achieves strong
performance on TraceAegis-Bench, successfully identifying the majority of
abnormal behaviors.

Abstract: Threshold-Computation-in-the-Head (TCitH) and VOLE-in-the-Head (VOLEitH), two

significantly improved the performance of digital signature schemes in this
framework.
  In this note, we embed the restricted decoding problem within these
frameworks. We propose a structurally simple modeling that achieves competitive
signature sizes. Specifically, by instantiating the restricted decoding problem
with the same hardness assumption underlying CROSS, we reduce sizes by more
than a factor of two compared to the NIST submission. Moreover, we observe that
ternary full-weight decoding, closely related to the hardness assumption
underlying WAVE, is a restricted decoding problem. Using ternary full-weight
decoding, we obtain signature sizes comparable to the smallest MPCitH-based
candidates in the NIST competition.

by agent collaboration in MAS. To bridge this gap, we present the first
Distributed Backdoor Attack tailored to MAS. We decompose the backdoor into
multiple distributed attack primitives that are embedded within MAS tools.
These primitives remain dormant individually but collectively activate only
when agents collaborate in a specific sequence, thereby assembling the full
backdoor to execute targeted attacks such as data exfiltration. To fully assess
this threat, we introduce a benchmark for multi-role collaborative tasks and a
sandboxed framework to evaluate. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
attack achieves an attack success rate exceeding 95% without degrading
performance on benign tasks. This work exposes novel backdoor attack surfaces
that exploit agent collaboration, underscoring the need to move beyond
single-agent protection. Code and benchmark are available at

Abstract: The widespread use of large language models (LLMs) and open-source code has
raised ethical and security concerns regarding the distribution and attribution
of source code, including unauthorized redistribution, license violations, and
misuse of code for malicious purposes. Watermarking has emerged as a promising
solution for source attribution, but existing techniques rely heavily on
hand-crafted transformation rules, abstract syntax tree (AST) manipulation, or
task-specific training, limiting their scalability and generality across
languages. Moreover, their robustness against attacks remains limited. To
address these limitations, we propose CodeMark-LLM, an LLM-driven watermarking
framework that embeds watermark into source code without compromising its
semantics or readability. CodeMark-LLM consists of two core components: (i)
Semantically Consistent Embedding module that applies functionality-preserving
transformations to encode watermark bits, and (ii) Differential Comparison
Extraction module that identifies the applied transformations by comparing the
original and watermarked code. Leveraging the cross-lingual generalization
ability of LLM, CodeMark-LLM avoids language-specific engineering and training
pipelines. Extensive experiments across diverse programming languages and
attack scenarios demonstrate its robustness, effectiveness, and scalability.

Abstract: Privacy models were introduced in privacy-preserving data publishing and
statistical disclosure control with the promise to end the need for costly
empirical assessment of disclosure risk. We examine how well this promise is
kept by the main privacy models. We find they may fail to provide adequate
protection guarantees because of problems in their definition or incur
unacceptable trade-offs between privacy protection and utility preservation.
Specifically, k-anonymity may not entirely exclude disclosure if enforced with
deterministic mechanisms or without constraints on the confidential values. On
the other hand, differential privacy (DP) incurs unacceptable utility loss for
small budgets and its privacy guarantee becomes meaningless for large budgets.
In the latter case, an ex post empirical assessment of disclosure risk becomes
necessary, undermining the main appeal of privacy models. Whereas the utility
preservation of DP can only be improved by relaxing its privacy guarantees, we
argue that a semantic reformulation of k-anonymity can offer more robust
privacy without losing utility with respect to traditional syntactic
k-anonymity.

Abstract: The rise of digital medical imaging, like MRI and CT, demands strong
encryption to protect patient data in telemedicine and cloud storage. Chaotic
systems are popular for image encryption due to their sensitivity and unique
characteristics, but existing methods often lack sufficient security. This
paper presents the Three-dimensional Diffusion Algorithm and Deep Learning
Image Encryption system (TDADL-IE), built on three key elements. First, we
propose an enhanced chaotic generator using an LSTM network with a 1D-Sine
Quadratic Chaotic Map (1D-SQCM) for better pseudorandom sequence generation.
Next, a new three-dimensional diffusion algorithm (TDA) is applied to encrypt
permuted images. TDADL-IE is versatile for images of any size. Experiments
confirm its effectiveness against various security threats. The code is

Abstract: Mysterious sightings of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) over U.S. military
facilities, suburban neighborhoods, and commercial airports have intensified
scrutiny of drone activity. To increase accountability, the Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) introduced a Remote ID mandate, requiring unmanned
aircraft to broadcast their location, operator's location, and identity in
real-time. However, current standards leave authentication mechanisms
underspecified, enabling spoofing, relay, and replay attacks that can undermine
surveillance efforts and potentially disrupt UAS-to-UAS coordination in future
deployments. In this paper, we propose TBRD, a practical system for
authenticating Remote ID messages in a manner that aligns with existing
standards and UAS capabilities. TBRD leverages the TESLA protocol and mobile
device TEEs, and introduces a verification mechanism to build a lightweight,
mission-scoped authentication system that is both computationally efficient and
requires a low communication footprint. We evaluate the performance of TBRD
using both an FAA-requirements compatible proof-of-concept implementation for
performance metrics and a simulated 4-drone swarm mission scenario to
demonstrate its security guarantees under adversarial conditions. Our system
provides a 50\% reduction in authentication overhead compared to digital
signatures and a 100x reduction in computation time. Our results demonstrate
that TBRD can be integrated into current Remote ID infrastructures to provide a
scalable, standards-compliant message authentication for both regulatory and
operational use cases.

Abstract: In living off the land attacks, malicious actors use legitimate tools and
processes already present on a system to avoid detection. In this paper, we
explore how the on-device LLMs of the future will become a security concern as
threat actors integrate LLMs into their living off the land attack pipeline and
ways the security community may mitigate this threat.

Abstract: The proliferation of autonomous AI agents within enterprise environments
introduces a critical security challenge: managing access control for emergent,
novel tasks for which no predefined policies exist. This paper introduces an
advanced security framework that extends the Task-Based Access Control (TBAC)
model by using a Large Language Model (LLM) as an autonomous, risk-aware judge.
This model makes access control decisions not only based on an agent's intent
but also by explicitly considering the inherent \textbf{risk associated with
target resources} and the LLM's own \textbf{model uncertainty} in its
decision-making process. When an agent proposes a novel task, the LLM judge
synthesizes a just-in-time policy while also computing a composite risk score
for the task and an uncertainty estimate for its own reasoning. High-risk or
high-uncertainty requests trigger more stringent controls, such as requiring
human approval. This dual consideration of external risk and internal
confidence allows the model to enforce a more robust and adaptive version of
the principle of least privilege, paving the way for safer and more trustworthy
autonomous systems.

Abstract: Recent reasoning-based safety guardrails for Large Reasoning Models (LRMs),
such as deliberative alignment, have shown strong defense against jailbreak
attacks. By leveraging LRMs' reasoning ability, these guardrails help the
models to assess the safety of user inputs before generating final responses.
The powerful reasoning ability can analyze the intention of the input query and
will refuse to assist once it detects the harmful intent hidden by the
jailbreak methods. Such guardrails have shown a significant boost in defense,
such as the near-perfect refusal rates on the open-source gpt-oss series.
Unfortunately, we find that these powerful reasoning-based guardrails can be
extremely vulnerable to subtle manipulation of the input prompts, and once
hijacked, can lead to even more harmful results. Specifically, we first uncover
a surprisingly fragile aspect of these guardrails: simply adding a few template
tokens to the input prompt can successfully bypass the seemingly powerful
guardrails and lead to explicit and harmful responses. To explore further, we
introduce a bag of jailbreak methods that subvert the reasoning-based
guardrails. Our attacks span white-, gray-, and black-box settings and range
from effortless template manipulations to fully automated optimization. Along
with the potential for scalable implementation, these methods also achieve
alarmingly high attack success rates (e.g., exceeding 90% across 5 different
benchmarks on gpt-oss series on both local host models and online API
services). Evaluations across various leading open-source LRMs confirm that
these vulnerabilities are systemic, underscoring the urgent need for stronger
alignment techniques for open-sourced LRMs to prevent malicious misuse. Code is
open-sourced at https://chenxshuo.github.io/bag-of-tricks.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The increasing autonomy of Large Language Models (LLMs) necessitates a
rigorous evaluation of their potential to aid in cyber offense. Existing
benchmarks often lack real-world complexity and are thus unable to accurately
assess LLMs' cybersecurity capabilities. To address this gap, we introduce
PACEbench, a practical AI cyber-exploitation benchmark built on the principles
of realistic vulnerability difficulty, environmental complexity, and cyber
defenses. Specifically, PACEbench comprises four scenarios spanning single,
blended, chained, and defense vulnerability exploitations. To handle these
complex challenges, we propose PACEagent, a novel agent that emulates human
penetration testers by supporting multi-phase reconnaissance, analysis, and
exploitation. Extensive experiments with seven frontier LLMs demonstrate that
current models struggle with complex cyber scenarios, and none can bypass
defenses. These findings suggest that current models do not yet pose a
generalized cyber offense threat. Nonetheless, our work provides a robust
benchmark to guide the trustworthy development of future models.
