In this paper, we first identify Mode Selection as a more challenging\nvariant of the Early Exit problem, as they share similar objectives but differ\nin decision timing. While Early Exit focuses on determining the best stopping\npoint for concise reasoning at inference time, Mode Selection must make this\ndecision at the beginning of the reasoning process, relying on pre-defined fake\nthoughts without engaging in an explicit reasoning process, referred to as\nzero-step thinking. Through empirical studies on nine baselines, we observe\nthat prompt-based approaches often fail due to their limited classification\ncapabilities when provided with minimal hand-crafted information. In contrast,\napproaches that leverage internal information generally perform better across\nmost scenarios but still exhibit issues with stability. Our findings indicate\nthat existing methods relying solely on the information provided by models are\ninsufficient for effectively addressing Mode Selection in scenarios with\nlimited information, highlighting the ongoing challenges of this task.

For example, minor hyperparameter\nchanges, such as learning rate adjustments or switching between SGD variants\ncan reverse the slope of a learning curve in widely used generalization\nmeasures like the path norm. We also identify subtler forms of fragility. For\ninstance, the PAC-Bayes origin measure is regarded as one of the most reliable,\nand is indeed less sensitive to hyperparameter tweaks than many other measures.\nHowever, it completely fails to capture differences in data complexity across\nlearning curves.

In contrast, the latter directly fine-tunes a carefully chosen\nsubset of the original model parameters, allowing for more precise and\neffective adaptation, but at the cost of significantly increased memory\nconsumption. To reconcile this trade-off, we propose NeuroAda, a novel PEFT\nmethod that enables fine-grained model finetuning while maintaining high memory\nefficiency. Our approach first identifies important parameters (i.e.,\nconnections within the network) as in selective adaptation, and then introduces\nbypass connections for these selected parameters. During finetuning, only the\nbypass connections are updated, leaving the original model parameters frozen.\nEmpirical results on 23+ tasks spanning both natural language generation and\nunderstanding demonstrate that NeuroAda achieves state-of-the-art performance\nwith as little as $\\leq \\textbf{0.02}\\%$ trainable parameters, while reducing\nCUDA memory usage by up to 60%.

However, approximate unlearning methods, often formulated as a\nsingle-objective optimization (SOO) problem, face a critical trade-off between\nunlearning efficacy and model fidelity. This leads to three primary challenges:\nthe risk of over-forgetting, a lack of fine-grained control over the unlearning\nprocess, and the absence of metrics to holistically evaluate the trade-off. To\naddress these issues, we reframe MU as a multi-objective optimization (MOO)\nproblem. We then introduce a novel algorithm, Controllable Unlearning by\nPivoting Gradient (CUP), which features a unique pivoting mechanism. Unlike\ntraditional MOO methods that converge to a single solution, CUP's mechanism is\ndesigned to controllably navigate the entire Pareto frontier. This navigation\nis governed by a single intuitive hyperparameter, the `unlearning intensity',\nwhich allows for precise selection of a desired trade-off.

When monitoring such systems by means of sensors, one\noften assumes that some form of `age' is latently present in the data, but\nperhaps the available sensors do not readily provide this useful information.\nThe task that we study in this paper is to extract potential proxies for this\n`age' from the available multi-variate time series without having clear data on\nwhat `age' actually is. We argue that when we find a sensor, or more likely\nsome discovered function of the available sensors, that is sufficiently\nmonotonic, that function can act as the proxy we are searching for. Using a\ncarefully defined grammar and optimising the resulting equations in terms of\nmonotonicity, defined as the absolute Spearman's Rank Correlation between time\nand the candidate formula, the proposed approach generates a set of candidate\nfeatures which are then fitted and assessed on monotonicity. The proposed\nsystem is evaluated against an artificially generated dataset and two\nreal-world datasets. In all experiments, we show that the system is able to\ncombine sensors with low individual monotonicity into latent features with high\nmonotonicity. For the real-world dataset of InfraWatch, a structural health\nmonitoring project, we show that two features with individual absolute\nSpearman's $\\rho$ values of $0.13$ and $0.09$ can be combined into a proxy with\nan absolute Spearman's $\\rho$ of $0.95$.

Although existing acceleration\ntechniques have made progress, they still face challenges such as limited\napplicability, high training costs, or quality degradation.\n  Against this backdrop, \\textbf{Diffusion Caching} offers a promising\ntraining-free, architecture-agnostic, and efficient inference paradigm. Its\ncore mechanism identifies and reuses intrinsic computational redundancies in\nthe diffusion process.

However, state-of-the-art attacks\nrequire training numerous, often computationally expensive, reference models,\nlimiting their practicality. We present a novel approach for estimating\nmodel-level vulnerability, the TPR at low FPR, to membership inference attacks\nwithout requiring reference models. Empirical analysis shows loss distributions\nto be asymmetric and heavy-tailed and suggests that most points at risk from\nMIAs have moved from the tail (high-loss region) to the head (low-loss region)\nof the distribution after training. We leverage this insight to propose a\nmethod to estimate model-level vulnerability from the training and testing\ndistribution alone: using the absence of outliers from the high-loss region as\na predictor of the risk. We evaluate our method, the TNR of a simple loss\nattack, across a wide range of architectures and datasets and show it to\naccurately estimate model-level vulnerability to the SOTA MIA attack (LiRA). We\nalso show our method to outperform both low-cost (few reference models) attacks\nsuch as RMIA and other measures of distribution difference.

Can Alice prove that Bob is using\nher model, either by querying Bob's derivative model (query setting) or from\nthe text alone (observational setting)? We formulate this question as an\nindependence testing problem--in which the null hypothesis is that Bob's model\nor text is independent of Alice's randomized training run--and investigate it\nthrough the lens of palimpsestic memorization in language models: models are\nmore likely to memorize data seen later in training, so we can test whether Bob\nis using Alice's model using test statistics that capture correlation between\nBob's model or text and the ordering of training examples in Alice's training\nrun. If Alice has randomly shuffled her training data, then any significant\ncorrelation amounts to exactly quantifiable statistical evidence against the\nnull hypothesis, regardless of the composition of Alice's training data. In the\nquery setting, we directly estimate (via prompting) the likelihood Bob's model\ngives to Alice's training examples and order; we correlate the likelihoods of\nover 40 fine-tunes of various Pythia and OLMo base models ranging from 1B to\n12B parameters with the base model's training data order, achieving a p-value\non the order of at most 1e-8 in all but six cases. In the observational\nsetting, we try two approaches based on estimating 1) the likelihood of Bob's\ntext overlapping with spans of Alice's training examples and 2) the likelihood\nof Bob's text with respect to different versions of Alice's model we obtain by\nrepeating the last phase (e.g., 1%) of her training run on reshuffled data.

In this paper, we provide the first theoretical analysis showing\nthat a simplified transformer architecture trained via gradient descent can act\nas a near-optimal metalearner in a linear classification setting. We consider a\nnatural family of tasks where each task corresponds to a class-conditional\nGaussian mixture model, with the mean vectors lying in a shared $k$-dimensional\nsubspace of $R^d$. After training on a sufficient number of such tasks, we show\nthat the transformer can generalize to a new task using only $O(k / R^4)$\nin-context examples, where $R$ denotes the signal strength at test time.
