In response, this work introduces the Hashed Fractal\nKey Recovery (HFKR) problem, a non-algebraic cryptographic construction\ngrounded in symbolic dynamics and chaotic perturbations. HFKR builds on the\nSymbolic Path Inversion Problem (SPIP), leveraging symbolic trajectories\ngenerated via contractive affine maps over $\\mathbb{Z}^2$, and compressing them\ninto fixed-length cryptographic keys using hash-based obfuscation. A key\ncontribution of this paper is the empirical confirmation that these symbolic\npaths exhibit fractal behavior, quantified via box counting dimension, path\ngeometry, and spatial density measures. The observed fractal dimension\nincreases with trajectory length and stabilizes near 1.06, indicating symbolic\nself-similarity and space-filling complexity, both of which reinforce the\nentropy foundation of the scheme. Experimental results across 250 perturbation\ntrials show that SHA3-512 and SHAKE256 amplify symbolic divergence effectively,\nachieving mean Hamming distances near 255, ideal bit-flip rates, and negligible\nentropy deviation. In contrast, BLAKE3 exhibits statistically uniform but\nweaker diffusion. These findings confirm that HFKR post-quantum security arises\nfrom the synergy between symbolic fractality and hash-based entropy\namplification. The resulting construction offers a lightweight, structure-free\nfoundation for secure key generation in adversarial settings without relying on\nalgebraic hardness assumptions."}

In our\nwork, we first demonstrate visual stitching abilities in common open-source\nVLMs on three datasets where each image is labeled with a unique synthetic ID:\nwe split each $(\\texttt{image}, \\texttt{ID})$ pair into $\\{(\\texttt{patch},\n\\texttt{ID})\\}$ pairs at different granularity for finetuning, and we find that\ntuned models can verbalize the correct IDs from full images or text reference.\nBuilding on this, we simulate the adversarial data poisoning scenario mentioned\nabove by using patches from dangerous images and replacing IDs with text\ndescriptions like ``safe'' or ``unsafe'', demonstrating how harmful content can\nevade moderation in patches and later be reconstructed through visual\nstitching, posing serious VLM safety risks.

This paper presents a systematic\nanalysis of how two popular watermarking approaches-Gumbel and KGW-affect these\ncore alignment properties across four aligned LLMs. Our experiments reveal two\ndistinct degradation patterns: guard attenuation, where enhanced helpfulness\nundermines model safety, and guard amplification, where excessive caution\nreduces model helpfulness. These patterns emerge from watermark-induced shifts\nin token distribution, surfacing the fundamental tension that exists between\nalignment objectives.\n  To mitigate these degradations, we propose Alignment Resampling (AR), an\ninference-time sampling method that uses an external reward model to restore\nalignment. We establish a theoretical lower bound on the improvement in\nexpected reward score as the sample size is increased and empirically\ndemonstrate that sampling just 2-4 watermarked generations effectively recovers\nor surpasses baseline (unwatermarked) alignment scores. To overcome the limited\nresponse diversity of standard Gumbel watermarking, our modified implementation\nsacrifices strict distortion-freeness while maintaining robust detectability,\nensuring compatibility with AR. Experimental results confirm that AR\nsuccessfully recovers baseline alignment in both watermarking approaches, while\nmaintaining strong watermark detectability.

First, we establish negative results showing\nthat if an adversary controls the seed of the generative model, a single\nsynthetic data point can leak as much information as releasing the model\nitself. Conversely, we show that when synthetic data is generated from random\ninputs, releasing a limited number of synthetic data points amplifies privacy\nbeyond the model's inherent guarantees.

In response, this work introduces the Hashed Fractal\nKey Recovery (HFKR) problem, a non-algebraic cryptographic construction\ngrounded in symbolic dynamics and chaotic perturbations. HFKR builds on the\nSymbolic Path Inversion Problem (SPIP), leveraging symbolic trajectories\ngenerated via contractive affine maps over $\\mathbb{Z}^2$, and compressing them\ninto fixed-length cryptographic keys using hash-based obfuscation. A key\ncontribution of this paper is the empirical confirmation that these symbolic\npaths exhibit fractal behavior, quantified via box counting dimension, path\ngeometry, and spatial density measures. The observed fractal dimension\nincreases with trajectory length and stabilizes near 1.06, indicating symbolic\nself-similarity and space-filling complexity, both of which reinforce the\nentropy foundation of the scheme. Experimental results across 250 perturbation\ntrials show that SHA3-512 and SHAKE256 amplify symbolic divergence effectively,\nachieving mean Hamming distances near 255, ideal bit-flip rates, and negligible\nentropy deviation. In contrast, BLAKE3 exhibits statistically uniform but\nweaker diffusion.

Specifically, we identify the impact of a\nkey family of features on AT that are shared by multiple classes, which we call\ncross-class features. These features are typically useful for robust\nclassification, which we offer theoretical evidence to illustrate through a\nsynthetic data model. Through systematic studies across multiple model\narchitectures and settings, we find that during the initial stage of AT, the\nmodel tends to learn more cross-class features until the best robustness\ncheckpoint. As AT further squeezes the training robust loss and causes robust\noverfitting, the model tends to make decisions based on more class-specific\nfeatures. Based on these discoveries, we further provide a unified view of two\nexisting properties of AT, including the advantage of soft-label training and\nrobust overfitting. Overall, these insights refine the current understanding of\nAT mechanisms and provide new perspectives on studying them.

Fine-tuning of\nLLMs was conducted to classify 14 labels from MIMIC-CXR dataset, and 18 labels\nfrom CT-RATE dataset using Differentially Private Low-Rank Adaptation (DP-LoRA)\nin high and moderate privacy regimes (across a range of privacy budgets =\n{0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10.0}). Model performance was evaluated using weighted F1\nscore across three model architectures: BERT-medium, BERT-small, and\nALBERT-base. Statistical analyses compared model performance across different\nprivacy levels to quantify the privacy-utility trade-off. Results: We observe a\nclear privacy-utility trade-off through our experiments on 2 different datasets\nand 3 different models. Under moderate privacy guarantees the DP fine-tuned\nmodels achieved comparable weighted F1 scores of 0.88 on MIMIC-CXR and 0.59 on\nCT-RATE, compared to non-private LoRA baselines of 0.90 and 0.78, respectively.\nConclusion: Differentially private fine-tuning using LoRA enables effective and\nprivacy-preserving multi-abnormality classification from radiology reports,\naddressing a key challenge in fine-tuning LLMs on sensitive medical data."}

However, ASan incurs significant runtime overhead, which\nlimits its efficiency in testing large software. The overhead mainly comes from\nsanitizer checks due to the frequent and expensive shadow memory access. Over\nthe past decade, many methods have been developed to speed up ASan by\neliminating and accelerating sanitizer checks, however, they either fail to\nadequately eliminate redundant checks or compromise detection capabilities. To\naddress this issue, this paper presents Tech-ASan, a two-stage check based\ntechnique to accelerate ASan with safety assurance. First, we propose a novel\ntwo-stage check algorithm for ASan, which leverages magic value comparison to\nreduce most of the costly shadow memory accesses. Second, we design an\nefficient optimizer to eliminate redundant checks, which integrates a novel\nalgorithm for removing checks in loops. Third, we implement Tech-ASan as a\nmemory safety tool based on the LLVM compiler infrastructure. Our evaluation\nusing the SPEC CPU2006 benchmark shows that Tech-ASan outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art methods with 33.70% and 17.89% less runtime overhead than ASan\nand ASan--, respectively.

We first design a\ntask-specific neuron extraction mechanism to decouple logically related neurons\nand construct a layered policy tree for handling coupled neurons.

Patching these vulnerabilities in a timely manner\nis crucial to restoring the integrity and security of software systems.\nHowever, previous work has shown that vulnerability reports often lack\nproof-of-concept (PoC) exploits, which are essential for fixing the\nvulnerability, testing patches, and avoiding regressions. Creating a PoC\nexploit is challenging because vulnerability reports are informal and often\nincomplete, and because it requires a detailed understanding of how inputs\npassed to potentially vulnerable APIs may reach security-relevant sinks. In\nthis paper, we present PoCGen, a novel approach to autonomously generate and\nvalidate PoC exploits for vulnerabilities in npm packages. This is the first\nfully autonomous approach to use large language models (LLMs) in tandem with\nstatic and dynamic analysis techniques for PoC exploit generation. PoCGen\nleverages an LLM for understanding vulnerability reports, for generating\ncandidate PoC exploits, and for validating and refining them.

Materials and Methods: We used 50,232 radiology\nreports from the publicly available MIMIC-CXR chest radiography and CT-RATE\ncomputed tomography datasets, collected between 2011 and 2019. Fine-tuning of\nLLMs was conducted to classify 14 labels from MIMIC-CXR dataset, and 18 labels\nfrom CT-RATE dataset using Differentially Private Low-Rank Adaptation (DP-LoRA)\nin high and moderate privacy regimes (across a range of privacy budgets =\n{0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10.0}). Model performance was evaluated using weighted F1\nscore across three model architectures: BERT-medium, BERT-small, and\nALBERT-base. Statistical analyses compared model performance across different\nprivacy levels to quantify the privacy-utility trade-off. Results: We observe a\nclear privacy-utility trade-off through our experiments on 2 different datasets\nand 3 different models. Under moderate privacy guarantees the DP fine-tuned\nmodels achieved comparable weighted F1 scores of 0.88 on MIMIC-CXR and 0.59 on\nCT-RATE, compared to non-private LoRA baselines of 0.90 and 0.78, respectively.\nConclusion: Differentially private fine-tuning using LoRA enables effective and\nprivacy-preserving multi-abnormality classification from radiology reports,\naddressing a key challenge in fine-tuning LLMs on sensitive medical data."}

By leveraging DP tools such as clustering, partition selection, and\nhistogram-based summarization, $Urania$ provides end-to-end privacy protection.\nOur evaluation assesses lexical and semantic content preservation, pair\nsimilarity, and LLM-based metrics, benchmarking against a non-private\nClio-inspired pipeline (Tamkin et al., 2024). Moreover, we develop a simple\nempirical privacy evaluation that demonstrates the enhanced robustness of our\nDP pipeline. The results show the framework's ability to extract meaningful\nconversational insights while maintaining stringent user privacy, effectively\nbalancing data utility with privacy preservation."}

Using\nrepresentation engineering, we systematically induce, detect, and control such\ndeception in CoT-enabled LLMs, extracting \"deception vectors\" via Linear\nArtificial Tomography (LAT) for 89% detection accuracy.

However, ASan incurs significant runtime overhead, which\nlimits its efficiency in testing large software. The overhead mainly comes from\nsanitizer checks due to the frequent and expensive shadow memory access. Over\nthe past decade, many methods have been developed to speed up ASan by\neliminating and accelerating sanitizer checks, however, they either fail to\nadequately eliminate redundant checks or compromise detection capabilities. To\naddress this issue, this paper presents Tech-ASan, a two-stage check based\ntechnique to accelerate ASan with safety assurance. First, we propose a novel\ntwo-stage check algorithm for ASan, which leverages magic value comparison to\nreduce most of the costly shadow memory accesses. Second, we design an\nefficient optimizer to eliminate redundant checks, which integrates a novel\nalgorithm for removing checks in loops. Third, we implement Tech-ASan as a\nmemory safety tool based on the LLVM compiler infrastructure. Our evaluation\nusing the SPEC CPU2006 benchmark shows that Tech-ASan outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art methods with 33.70% and 17.89% less runtime overhead than ASan\nand ASan--, respectively. Moreover, Tech-ASan detects 56 fewer false negative\ncases than ASan and ASan-- when testing on the Juliet Test Suite under the same\nredzone setting."}

Specifically, we identify the impact of a\nkey family of features on AT that are shared by multiple classes, which we call\ncross-class features. These features are typically useful for robust\nclassification, which we offer theoretical evidence to illustrate through a\nsynthetic data model. Through systematic studies across multiple model\narchitectures and settings, we find that during the initial stage of AT, the\nmodel tends to learn more cross-class features until the best robustness\ncheckpoint. As AT further squeezes the training robust loss and causes robust\noverfitting, the model tends to make decisions based on more class-specific\nfeatures. Based on these discoveries, we further provide a unified view of two\nexisting properties of AT, including the advantage of soft-label training and\nrobust overfitting. Overall, these insights refine the current understanding of\nAT mechanisms and provide new perspectives on studying them.

Additionally, synthetic data may benefit from privacy\namplification when the generative model is kept hidden. While empirical studies\nsuggest this phenomenon, a rigorous theoretical understanding is still lacking.\nIn this paper, we investigate this question through the well-understood\nframework of linear regression. First, we establish negative results showing\nthat if an adversary controls the seed of the generative model, a single\nsynthetic data point can leak as much information as releasing the model\nitself. Conversely, we show that when synthetic data is generated from random\ninputs, releasing a limited number of synthetic data points amplifies privacy\nbeyond the model's inherent guarantees. We believe our findings in linear\nregression can serve as a foundation for deriving more general bounds in the\nfuture."}
