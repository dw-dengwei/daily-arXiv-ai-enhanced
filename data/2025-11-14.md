### [1] [Probability-Biased Attention over Directed Bipartite Graphs for Long-Tail ICD Coding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09559)
*Tianlei Chen,Yuxiao Chen,Yang Li,Feifei Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于有向二分图编码器的自动ICD编码方法，通过建模常见代码与罕见代码之间的细粒度共现关系来解决长尾分布问题，在多个基准数据集上取得了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动ICD编码面临标签空间大（10,000-20,000个代码）和长尾分布的挑战，许多罕见代码缺乏足够的训练数据。

Method: 构建有向二分图编码器，包含常见和罕见代码节点，边仅从常见代码指向罕见代码。使用基于条件概率的偏置注入注意力模块（共现编码），并利用大语言模型生成代码描述来丰富初始嵌入。

Result: 在三个自动ICD编码基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法实现了最先进的性能，特别是在长尾分类的关键指标Macro-F1上有显著提升。

Conclusion: 通过建模代码间的细粒度共现关系，该方法能够利用常见代码的潜在共病信息来丰富罕见代码的表示，有效解决了ICD编码中的长尾分布问题。

Abstract: Automated International Classification of Diseases (ICD) coding aims to assign multiple disease codes to clinical documents, constituting a crucial multi-label text classification task in healthcare informatics. However, the task is challenging due to its large label space (10,000 to 20,000 codes) and long-tail distribution, where a few codes dominate while many rare codes lack sufficient training data. To address this, we propose a learning method that models fine-grained co-occurrence relationships among codes. Specifically, we construct a Directed Bipartite Graph Encoder with disjoint sets of common and rare code nodes. To facilitate a one-way information flow, edges are directed exclusively from common to rare codes. The nature of these connections is defined by a probability-based bias, which is derived from the conditional probability of a common code co-occurring given the presence of a rare code. This bias is then injected into the encoder's attention module, a process we term Co-occurrence Encoding. This structure empowers the graph encoder to enrich rare code representations by aggregating latent comorbidity information reflected in the statistical co-occurrence of their common counterparts. To ensure high-quality input to the graph, we utilize a large language model (LLM) to generate comprehensive descriptions for codes, enriching initial embeddings with clinical context and comorbidity information, serving as external knowledge for the statistical co-occurrence relationships in the code system. Experiments on three automated ICD coding benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with particularly notable improvements in Macro-F1, which is the key metric for long-tail classification.

### [2] [Let the Experts Speak: Improving Survival Prediction & Calibration via Mixture-of-Experts Heads](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09567)
*Todd Morrill,Aahlad Puli,Murad Megjhani,Soojin Park,Richard Zemel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了几种基于离散时间深度混合专家（MoE）的生存分析架构，其中一个能够同时实现聚类、校准和预测准确性。研究发现，表达能力更强的专家模型能够为每个患者定制预测，优于依赖固定组原型的专家模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的深度混合专家模型在生存分析中虽然能够聚类相似患者，但往往以牺牲校准误差和预测准确性为代价。这是因为MoE施加了限制性归纳偏差，要求个体患者的预测必须与其所属组的预测相似。本文旨在探索是否能在发现患者群体结构的同时改善校准和预测准确性。

Method: 引入了多种基于离散时间深度混合专家（MoE）的生存分析架构，其中一个关键架构能够同时实现所有期望特性。研究比较了不同MoE架构中专家模型的表达能力差异。

Result: 研究发现表达能力更强的专家模型（能够为每个患者定制预测）在性能上优于依赖固定组原型的专家模型。其中一个MoE架构成功实现了聚类、校准和预测准确性的平衡。

Conclusion: 在生存分析中，使用表达能力更强的专家模型来为每个患者定制预测，比依赖固定组原型的传统方法表现更好，能够同时实现有效的患者聚类和优越的预测性能。

Abstract: Deep mixture-of-experts models have attracted a lot of attention for survival analysis problems, particularly for their ability to cluster similar patients together. In practice, grouping often comes at the expense of key metrics such calibration error and predictive accuracy. This is due to the restrictive inductive bias that mixture-of-experts imposes, that predictions for individual patients must look like predictions for the group they're assigned to. Might we be able to discover patient group structure, where it exists, while improving calibration and predictive accuracy? In this work, we introduce several discrete-time deep mixture-of-experts (MoE) based architectures for survival analysis problems, one of which achieves all desiderata: clustering, calibration, and predictive accuracy. We show that a key differentiator between this array of MoEs is how expressive their experts are. We find that more expressive experts that tailor predictions per patient outperform experts that rely on fixed group prototypes.

### [3] [Filtering Jump Markov Systems with Partially Known Dynamics: A Model-Based Deep Learning Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09569)
*George Stamatelis,George C. Alexandropoulos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Jump Markov Filtering Network (JMFNet)，一种基于模型的深度学习框架，用于在噪声统计和模式转换动态未知的跳变马尔可夫系统中进行实时状态估计。该框架在非平稳和高噪声环境下优于传统模型滤波器和无模型深度学习方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决跳变马尔可夫系统中状态估计的挑战，特别是在噪声统计和模式转换动态未知的情况下，传统方法性能受限，需要开发更鲁棒的实时估计算法。

Method: 采用混合架构，包含两个循环神经网络：一个用于模式预测，另一个基于KalmanNet架构的增强版本进行滤波。使用交替最小二乘策略联合训练RNN，无需潜在模式的监督。

Result: 在线性和非线性系统（包括目标跟踪、摆角跟踪、Lorenz吸引子动力学和真实数据集）上的实验表明，JMFNet优于经典模型滤波器和无模型深度学习方法，在复杂系统或长轨迹中相比KalmanNet有显著改进。

Conclusion: JMFNet在非平稳和高噪声环境下表现出色，对初始条件、超参数选择和模型知识错误具有低敏感性，性能一致可靠。

Abstract: This paper presents the Jump Markov Filtering Network (JMFNet), a novel model-based deep learning framework for real-time state-state estimation in jump Markov systems with unknown noise statistics and mode transition dynamics. A hybrid architecture comprising two Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) is proposed: one for mode prediction and another for filtering that is based on a mode-augmented version of the recently presented KalmanNet architecture. The proposed RNNs are trained jointly using an alternating least squares strategy that enables mutual adaptation without supervision of the latent modes. Extensive numerical experiments on linear and nonlinear systems, including target tracking, pendulum angle tracking, Lorenz attractor dynamics, and a real-life dataset demonstrate that the proposed JMFNet framework outperforms classical model-based filters (e.g., interacting multiple models and particle filters) as well as model-free deep learning baselines, particularly in non-stationary and high-noise regimes. It is also showcased that JMFNet achieves a small yet meaningful improvement over the KalmanNet framework, which becomes much more pronounced in complicated systems or long trajectories. Finally, the method's performance is empirically validated to be consistent and reliable, exhibiting low sensitivity to initial conditions, hyperparameter selection, as well as to incorrect model knowledge

### [4] [Group Averaging for Physics Applications: Accuracy Improvements at Zero Training Cost](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09573)
*Valentino F. Foit,David W. Hogg,Soledad Villar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文展示了在测试时使用群平均技术可以使任何训练好的模型精确等变，无需改变模型结构或训练过程，且能显著提升预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多自然科学中的机器学习任务具有特定的对称性，但等变方法往往未被采用，可能是因为训练困难、期望模型自行学习对称性，或等变实现被认为复杂。群平均技术提供了一种简单解决方案。

Method: 在评估时对训练好的模型进行群平均操作，即对模型在对称群上的输出进行平均，这种方法成本低且不依赖模型结构或训练过程。

Result: 实验表明群平均总是降低平均评估损失，VRMSE指标改进高达37%，对连续动力学产生视觉上更好的预测。

Conclusion: 在常见情况下，施加精确对称性没有缺点，群平均是提升模型精度的廉价简单方法，ML4PS社区应考虑采用。

Abstract: Many machine learning tasks in the natural sciences are precisely equivariant to particular symmetries. Nonetheless, equivariant methods are often not employed, perhaps because training is perceived to be challenging, or the symmetry is expected to be learned, or equivariant implementations are seen as hard to build. Group averaging is an available technique for these situations. It happens at test time; it can make any trained model precisely equivariant at a (often small) cost proportional to the size of the group; it places no requirements on model structure or training. It is known that, under mild conditions, the group-averaged model will have a provably better prediction accuracy than the original model. Here we show that an inexpensive group averaging can improve accuracy in practice. We take well-established benchmark machine learning models of differential equations in which certain symmetries ought to be obeyed. At evaluation time, we average the models over a small group of symmetries. Our experiments show that this procedure always decreases the average evaluation loss, with improvements of up to 37\% in terms of the VRMSE. The averaging produces visually better predictions for continuous dynamics. This short paper shows that, under certain common circumstances, there are no disadvantages to imposing exact symmetries; the ML4PS community should consider group averaging as a cheap and simple way to improve model accuracy.

### [5] [HeatGen: A Guided Diffusion Framework for Multiphysics Heat Sink Design Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09578)
*Hadi Keramati,Morteza Sadeghi,Rajeev K. Jaiman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于引导去噪扩散概率模型(DDPM)的生成优化框架，利用代理梯度生成最小化压降并保持表面温度在阈值以下的散热器设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统黑盒优化方法(如CMA-ES)在散热器设计中存在可扩展性差、计算成本高的问题，需要开发更高效、可扩展的生成优化方法。

Method: 使用边界表示法表示多翅片几何结构，采用多保真度方法生成训练数据。训练DDPM生成散热器设计，并训练两个残差神经网络预测压降和表面温度，利用代理梯度引导生成过程满足约束条件。

Result: 引导扩散模型生成的样本比传统黑盒优化方法获得的压降低限值低10%。模型训练后，在新约束条件下进行推理计算成本低廉且无需重新训练。

Conclusion: 该方法为构建电子冷却基础生成模型迈出了重要一步，相比传统方法具有更好的可扩展性和计算效率。

Abstract: This study presents a generative optimization framework based on a guided denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) that leverages surrogate gradients to generate heat sink designs minimizing pressure drop while maintaining surface temperatures below a specified threshold. Geometries are represented using boundary representations of multiple fins, and a multi-fidelity approach is employed to generate training data. Using this dataset, along with vectors representing the boundary representation geometries, we train a denoising diffusion probabilistic model to generate heat sinks with characteristics consistent with those observed in the data. We train two different residual neural networks to predict the pressure drop and surface temperature for each geometry. We use the gradients of these surrogate models with respect to the design variables to guide the geometry generation process toward satisfying the low-pressure and surface temperature constraints. This inference-time guidance directs the generative process toward heat sink designs that not only prevent overheating but also achieve lower pressure drops compared to traditional optimization methods such as CMA-ES. In contrast to traditional black-box optimization approaches, our method is scalable, provided sufficient training data is available. Unlike traditional topology optimization methods, once the model is trained and the heat sink world model is saved, inference under new constraints (e.g., temperature) is computationally inexpensive and does not require retraining. Samples generated using the guided diffusion model achieve pressure drops up to 10 percent lower than the limits obtained by traditional black-box optimization methods. This work represents a step toward building a foundational generative model for electronics cooling.

### [6] [Scaling Environments for LLM Agents in the Era of Learning from Interaction: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09586)
*Yuchen Huang,Sijia Li,Minghao Liu,Wei Liu,Shijue Huang,Zhiyuan Fan,Hou Pong Chan,Yi R. Fung*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出Generation-Execution-Feedback (GEF)循环框架，从环境中心视角系统综述了环境扩展方法，旨在解决静态数据集在训练智能体方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于静态人类知识构建的数据集成本高、缺乏动态性和真实性，无法充分培养智能体的自适应行为和长期决策能力，需要让智能体通过与环境交互学习经验。

Method: 提出GEF循环框架，将环境扩展方法按任务生成、任务执行和反馈三个阶段组织，系统综述代表性方法。

Result: 建立了环境扩展方法的分类体系，分析了基准测试、实现策略和应用场景，整合了碎片化进展。

Conclusion: 环境作为经验数据生产者对智能体智能发展至关重要，需要向更复杂、真实和交互的方向扩展，为未来研究指明了方向。

Abstract: LLM-based agents can autonomously accomplish complex tasks across various domains. However, to further cultivate capabilities such as adaptive behavior and long-term decision-making, training on static datasets built from human-level knowledge is insufficient. These datasets are costly to construct and lack both dynamism and realism. A growing consensus is that agents should instead interact directly with environments and learn from experience through reinforcement learning. We formalize this iterative process as the Generation-Execution-Feedback (GEF) loop, where environments generate tasks to challenge agents, return observations in response to agents' actions during task execution, and provide evaluative feedback on rollouts for subsequent learning. Under this paradigm, environments function as indispensable producers of experiential data, highlighting the need to scale them toward greater complexity, realism, and interactivity. In this survey, we systematically review representative methods for environment scaling from a pioneering environment-centric perspective and organize them along the stages of the GEF loop, namely task generation, task execution, and feedback. We further analyze benchmarks, implementation strategies, and applications, consolidating fragmented advances and outlining future research directions for agent intelligence.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DR-GNN是一种新颖的图神经网络方法，通过结合静态结构和多周期执行行为来学习RTL电路表示，解决了现有模型无法捕捉电路运行时行为的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图神经网络主要关注电路的静态特性，但无法捕捉对电路验证和优化至关重要的运行时行为，这限制了模型的实际应用效果。

Method: DR-GNN利用操作符级控制数据流图表示RTL电路，通过整合静态结构和多周期执行行为来捕捉动态依赖关系和运行时执行特征。

Result: 在超过6,300个Verilog设计和63,000个仿真轨迹的数据集上，DR-GNN在分支命中预测和翻转率预测方面优于现有模型，其学习表示还能有效迁移到功耗估计和断言预测等动态电路任务。

Conclusion: DR-GNN通过结合静态和动态信息成功捕捉了电路的运行时行为，为电路验证和优化提供了更有效的表示学习方法，并在多个任务上展现出优越性能。

Abstract: There is a growing body of work on using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn representations of circuits, focusing primarily on their static characteristics. However, these models fail to capture circuit runtime behavior, which is crucial for tasks like circuit verification and optimization. To address this limitation, we introduce DR-GNN (DynamicRTL-GNN), a novel approach that learns RTL circuit representations by incorporating both static structures and multi-cycle execution behaviors. DR-GNN leverages an operator-level Control Data Flow Graph (CDFG) to represent Register Transfer Level (RTL) circuits, enabling the model to capture dynamic dependencies and runtime execution. To train and evaluate DR-GNN, we build the first comprehensive dynamic circuit dataset, comprising over 6,300 Verilog designs and 63,000 simulation traces. Our results demonstrate that DR-GNN outperforms existing models in branch hit prediction and toggle rate prediction. Furthermore, its learned representations transfer effectively to related dynamic circuit tasks, achieving strong performance in power estimation and assertion prediction.

### [8] [Making Every Head Count: Sparse Attention Without the Speed-Performance Trade-off](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09596)
*Mingkuan Zhao,Wentao Hu,Jiayin Wang,Xin Lai,Tianchen Huang,Yuheng Min,Rui Yan,Xiaoyan Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPAttention通过引入原则性结构稀疏性，将多头注意力计算从H个独立的O(N²)计算转变为单个协作的O(N²)计算，在保持性能的同时将训练吞吐量提升约两倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多头注意力机制中存在的计算冗余问题，标准实现中所有头独立计算相同序列空间的注意力，导致O(H·N²)的计算复杂度，现有稀疏方法往往以信息完整性为代价换取计算效率。

Method: 采用原则性结构稀疏性范式，将总注意力工作量划分为平衡的非重叠距离带，为每个头分配唯一片段，强制头之间功能专业化，实现更高效的计算资源分配。

Result: 在OLMoE-1B-7B和0.25B-1.75B模型系列上的广泛验证显示，训练吞吐量提升约两倍，性能与标准密集注意力相当，在某些关键指标上甚至超越，同时在所有评估指标上持续优于Longformer、Reformer和BigBird等代表性稀疏注意力方法。

Conclusion: SPAttention通过结构化的归纳偏置成功解决了效率-性能权衡问题，为大型语言模型设计提供了更高效的注意力机制解决方案。

Abstract: The design of Large Language Models (LLMs) has long been hampered by a fundamental conflict within their core attention mechanism: its remarkable expressivity is built upon a computational complexity of $O(H \cdot N^2)$ that grows quadratically with the context size ($N$) and linearly with the number of heads ($H$). This standard implementation harbors significant computational redundancy, as all heads independently compute attention over the same sequence space. Existing sparse methods, meanwhile, often trade information integrity for computational efficiency. To resolve this efficiency-performance trade-off, we propose SPAttention, whose core contribution is the introduction of a new paradigm we term Principled Structural Sparsity. SPAttention does not merely drop connections but instead reorganizes the computational task by partitioning the total attention workload into balanced, non-overlapping distance bands, assigning each head a unique segment. This approach transforms the multi-head attention mechanism from $H$ independent $O(N^2)$ computations into a single, collaborative $O(N^2)$ computation, fundamentally reducing complexity by a factor of $H$. The structured inductive bias compels functional specialization among heads, enabling a more efficient allocation of computational resources from redundant modeling to distinct dependencies across the entire sequence span. Extensive empirical validation on the OLMoE-1B-7B and 0.25B-1.75B model series demonstrates that while delivering an approximately two-fold increase in training throughput, its performance is on par with standard dense attention, even surpassing it on select key metrics, while consistently outperforming representative sparse attention methods including Longformer, Reformer, and BigBird across all evaluation metrics.

*Tingyang Wei,Jiao Liu,Abhishek Gupta,Chin Chun Ooi,Puay Siew Tan,Yew-Soon Ong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了首个参数化多目标贝叶斯优化器，通过交替进行采集驱动搜索和生成式解决方案采样，学习逆模型以直接预测任意任务-偏好查询的优化解，无需昂贵重评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中需要在变化操作条件下解决昂贵的多目标优化问题族，即参数化昂贵多目标优化问题(P-EMOPs)。现有方法需为每个任务单独优化，而连续任务参数空间包含无限个问题，每个都需要昂贵评估，这要求学习能直接预测优化解的逆模型。

Method: 交替进行：(1)利用任务间协同效应的采集驱动搜索；(2)通过条件生成模型进行生成式解决方案采样。使用任务感知高斯过程理论证明更快收敛。

Result: 理论分析表明通过任务间协同效应实现更快收敛，合成和真实世界基准测试验证了交替框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法能高效优化相关任务，最终实现无需额外昂贵评估即可直接预测未见参数化EMOPs的解决方案。

Abstract: Many real-world applications require solving families of expensive multi-objective optimization problems~(EMOPs) under varying operational conditions. This gives rise to parametric expensive multi-objective optimization problems (P-EMOPs) where each task parameter defines a distinct optimization instance. Current multi-objective Bayesian optimization methods have been widely used for finding finite sets of Pareto optimal solutions for individual tasks. However, P-EMOPs present a fundamental challenge: the continuous task parameter space can contain infinite distinct problems, each requiring separate expensive evaluations. This demands learning an inverse model that can directly predict optimized solutions for any task-preference query without expensive re-evaluation. This paper introduces the first parametric multi-objective Bayesian optimizer that learns this inverse model by alternating between (1) acquisition-driven search leveraging inter-task synergies and (2) generative solution sampling via conditional generative models. This approach enables efficient optimization across related tasks and finally achieves direct solution prediction for unseen parameterized EMOPs without additional expensive evaluations. We theoretically justify the faster convergence by leveraging inter-task synergies through task-aware Gaussian processes. Meanwhile, empirical studies in synthetic and real-world benchmarks further verify the effectiveness of our alternating framework.

*Mohammad Alipour-Vaezi,Huaiyang Zhong,Kwok-Leung Tsui,Sajad Khodadadian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了UCB-QRL算法，一种用于有限时域马尔可夫决策过程中τ-分位数目标的乐观学习算法，通过置信区间估计和优化来解决风险敏感强化学习问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典强化学习基础未考虑目标函数的风险敏感性，这在医疗和金融等领域至关重要。通过优化累积奖励分布的特定分位数来纳入风险敏感性。

Method: UCB-QRL是一种迭代算法，在每个迭代中首先估计转移概率，然后在置信球内优化分位数价值函数。

Result: UCB-QRL在情景设置中获得了高概率遗憾界O((2/κ)^{H+1}H√(SATHlog(2SATH/δ)))，其中κ是问题相关常数。

Conclusion: UCB-QRL算法为风险敏感强化学习提供了理论保证，能够有效处理分位数目标优化问题。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has achieved tremendous success in recent years. However, the classical foundations of RL do not account for the risk sensitivity of the objective function, which is critical in various fields, including healthcare and finance. A popular approach to incorporate risk sensitivity is to optimize a specific quantile of the cumulative reward distribution. In this paper, we develop UCB-QRL, an optimistic learning algorithm for the $τ$-quantile objective in finite-horizon Markov decision processes (MDPs). UCB-QRL is an iterative algorithm in which, at each iteration, we first estimate the underlying transition probability and then optimize the quantile value function over a confidence ball around this estimate. We show that UCB-QRL yields a high-probability regret bound $\mathcal O\left((2/κ)^{H+1}H\sqrt{SATH\log(2SATH/δ)}\right)$ in the episodic setting with $S$ states, $A$ actions, $T$ episodes, and $H$ horizons. Here, $κ>0$ is a problem-dependent constant that captures the sensitivity of the underlying MDP's quantile value.

TL;DR: 论文挑战了表格深度学习需要大量预训练数据的观点，发现仅用单个真实表格进行自监督预训练就能实现跨领域的强泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战当前表格深度学习依赖大规模合成或真实数据集进行预训练的主流观点，探索更高效的数据利用方式。

Method: 使用简单的自监督预训练方法，在单个真实表格上进行预训练，并在多个异构基准数据集上系统评估迁移性能。

Result: 发现相对少量的数据就足以实现泛化，单个表格的预训练能在跨领域基准测试中产生令人惊讶的强迁移效果。

Conclusion: 构建表格基础模型的关键在于从数据集中能构建的任务数量和任务质量，而非数据规模本身。

Abstract: Deep tabular modelling increasingly relies on in-context learning where, during inference, a model receives a set of $(x,y)$ pairs as context and predicts labels for new inputs without weight updates. We challenge the prevailing view that broad generalization here requires pre-training on large synthetic corpora (e.g., TabPFN priors) or a large collection of real data (e.g., TabDPT training datasets), discovering that a relatively small amount of data suffices for generalization. We find that simple self-supervised pre-training on just a \emph{single} real table can produce surprisingly strong transfer across heterogeneous benchmarks. By systematically pre-training and evaluating on many diverse datasets, we analyze what aspects of the data are most important for building a Tabular Foundation Model (TFM) generalizing across domains. We then connect this to the pre-training procedure shared by most TFMs and show that the number and quality of \emph{tasks} one can construct from a dataset is key to downstream performance.

*Samuel Maddock,Shripad Gade,Graham Cormode,Will Bullock*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GEM+结合了AIM的自适应测量框架和GEM的可扩展生成器网络，在保持隐私的同时提高了合成表格数据的质量和可扩展性，特别适用于高维数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的差分隐私合成表格数据方法（如AIM）使用图形模型，在处理高维数据时存在内存消耗大和计算开销高的问题。GEM虽然使用生成器神经网络提高了可扩展性，但实证比较主要局限于小数据集。

Method: GEM+将AIM的自适应测量框架与GEM的可扩展生成器网络相结合，通过迭代测量低阶噪声边际并利用神经网络生成合成数据。

Result: 实验表明，GEM+在效用和可扩展性方面均优于AIM，能够高效处理超过100列的数据集，而AIM由于内存和计算开销而无法处理。

Conclusion: GEM+在差分隐私合成表格数据领域实现了最先进的性能，同时解决了高维数据处理的挑战。

Abstract: State-of-the-art differentially private synthetic tabular data has been defined by adaptive 'select-measure-generate' frameworks, exemplified by methods like AIM. These approaches iteratively measure low-order noisy marginals and fit graphical models to produce synthetic data, enabling systematic optimisation of data quality under privacy constraints. Graphical models, however, are inefficient for high-dimensional data because they require substantial memory and must be retrained from scratch whenever the graph structure changes, leading to significant computational overhead. Recent methods, like GEM, overcome these limitations by using generator neural networks for improved scalability. However, empirical comparisons have mostly focused on small datasets, limiting real-world applicability. In this work, we introduce GEM+, which integrates AIM's adaptive measurement framework with GEM's scalable generator network. Our experiments show that GEM+ outperforms AIM in both utility and scalability, delivering state-of-the-art results while efficiently handling datasets with over a hundred columns, where AIM fails due to memory and computational overheads.

*Pedro Dall'Antonia,Tiago da Silva,Daniel Augusto de Souza,César Lincoln C. Mattos,Diego Mesquita*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Boosted GFlowNets通过顺序训练集成模型来解决GFlowNets在探索奖励空间时的不平衡问题，每个后续模型优化残差奖励以补偿先前模型已捕获的质量，从而改善对高奖励区域的覆盖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GFlowNets在实践中往往难以均匀探索奖励空间：容易到达区域的轨迹主导训练，而难以到达的模式获得消失或无信息的梯度，导致高奖励区域覆盖不足。

Method: 提出Boosted GFlowNets方法，顺序训练GFlowNets集成，每个模型优化残差奖励来补偿先前模型已捕获的质量，在温和假设下确保单调非退化特性。

Result: 在合成多模态基准和肽设计任务中，Boosted GFlowNets实现了显著更好的探索和样本多样性，同时保持了标准轨迹平衡训练的稳定性和简单性。

Conclusion: Boosted GFlowNets通过残差学习机制有效解决了GFlowNets的探索不平衡问题，提高了对高奖励区域的覆盖能力，且不会降低学习分布的质量。

Abstract: Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) are powerful samplers for compositional objects that, by design, sample proportionally to a given non-negative reward. Nonetheless, in practice, they often struggle to explore the reward landscape evenly: trajectories toward easy-to-reach regions dominate training, while hard-to-reach modes receive vanishing or uninformative gradients, leading to poor coverage of high-reward areas. We address this imbalance with Boosted GFlowNets, a method that sequentially trains an ensemble of GFlowNets, each optimizing a residual reward that compensates for the mass already captured by previous models. This residual principle reactivates learning signals in underexplored regions and, under mild assumptions, ensures a monotone non-degradation property: adding boosters cannot worsen the learned distribution and typically improves it. Empirically, Boosted GFlowNets achieve substantially better exploration and sample diversity on multimodal synthetic benchmarks and peptide design tasks, while preserving the stability and simplicity of standard trajectory-balance training.

Conclusion: SEBA为视觉强化学习提供了一种样本高效的黑盒对抗攻击框架，在攻击性能和效率方面都表现出色。

Abstract: Visual reinforcement learning has achieved remarkable progress in visual control and robotics, but its vulnerability to adversarial perturbations remains underexplored. Most existing black-box attacks focus on vector-based or discrete-action RL, and their effectiveness on image-based continuous control is limited by the large action space and excessive environment queries. We propose SEBA, a sample-efficient framework for black-box adversarial attacks on visual RL agents. SEBA integrates a shadow Q model that estimates cumulative rewards under adversarial conditions, a generative adversarial network that produces visually imperceptible perturbations, and a world model that simulates environment dynamics to reduce real-world queries. Through a two-stage iterative training procedure that alternates between learning the shadow model and refining the generator, SEBA achieves strong attack performance while maintaining efficiency. Experiments on MuJoCo and Atari benchmarks show that SEBA significantly reduces cumulative rewards, preserves visual fidelity, and greatly decreases environment interactions compared to prior black-box and white-box methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于Text2SQL的约束强化学习框架，通过引入可解释的奖励和约束信号，动态平衡训练过程中的权衡，解决了传统RL方法中奖励函数设计敏感和奖励黑客问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习方法在Text2SQL任务中对奖励函数设计高度敏感，不合适的奖励会导致模型利用奖励结构漏洞而非真正解决问题。

Method: 采用约束强化学习框架，结合自然可解释的奖励和约束信号，在训练过程中动态平衡这些信号之间的权衡。

Result: 在知名Text2SQL数据集上的数值实验证实了该方法相对于最先进RL训练LLMs的改进。

Conclusion: 该约束强化学习框架为Text2SQL任务提供了理论保证，并通过实验验证了其有效性，解决了奖励黑客问题。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated significant promise in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Text2SQL LLMs, especially with advanced algorithms such as GRPO and DAPO. However, the performance of these methods is highly sensitive to the design of reward functions. Inappropriate rewards can lead to reward hacking, where models exploit loopholes in the reward structure to achieve high scores without genuinely solving the task. This work considers a constrained RL framework for Text2SQL that incorporates natural and interpretable reward and constraint signals, while dynamically balancing trade-offs among them during the training. We establish the theoretical guarantees of our constrained RL framework and our numerical experiments on the well-known Text2SQL datasets substantiate the improvement of our approach over the state-of-the-art RL-trained LLMs.

TL;DR: MCR是一种使用模运算的高维整数向量计算模型，在容量、精度和硬件效率之间实现了独特平衡，相比二进制模型可减少4倍内存使用，专用加速器可带来3个数量级的速度提升和显著能耗降低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MCR作为二进制稀疏编码模型的泛化，旨在提供更强的表示能力，同时保持轻量级特性。但由于缺乏系统分析，其复杂性被认为超过了表达能力提升带来的好处，因此需要重新评估其实际价值。

Method: 对MCR进行了首次广泛评估，包括容量测量、123个数据集的准确性测试，以及专用硬件加速器的设计和实现。

Result: MCR在容量上优于二进制和整数向量，接近复数表示但内存占用更少；在准确性上可匹配二进制稀疏码性能但内存减少4倍；硬件实现可带来3个数量级速度提升和2.68倍能耗降低。

Conclusion: 尽管MCR操作比二进制稀疏码更复杂，但其模运算和更高精度实现了更低维度，配合专用硬件可成为更快、更节能、更高精度的替代方案。

Abstract: The modular composite representation (MCR) is a computing model that represents information with high-dimensional integer vectors using modular arithmetic. Originally proposed as a generalization of the binary spatter code model, it aims to provide higher representational power while remaining a lighter alternative to models requiring high-precision components. Despite this potential, MCR has received limited attention. Systematic analyses of its trade-offs and comparisons with other models are lacking, sustaining the perception that its added complexity outweighs the improved expressivity. In this work, we revisit MCR by presenting its first extensive evaluation, demonstrating that it achieves a unique balance of capacity, accuracy, and hardware efficiency. Experiments measuring capacity demonstrate that MCR outperforms binary and integer vectors while approaching complex-valued representations at a fraction of their memory footprint. Evaluation on 123 datasets confirms consistent accuracy gains and shows that MCR can match the performance of binary spatter codes using up to 4x less memory. We investigate the hardware realization of MCR by showing that it maps naturally to digital logic and by designing the first dedicated accelerator. Evaluations on basic operations and 7 selected datasets demonstrate a speedup of up to 3 orders of magnitude and significant energy reductions compared to software implementation. When matched for accuracy against binary spatter codes, MCR achieves on average 3.08x faster execution and 2.68x lower energy consumption. These findings demonstrate that, although MCR requires more sophisticated operations than binary spatter codes, its modular arithmetic and higher per-component precision enable lower dimensionality. When realized with dedicated hardware, this results in a faster, more energy-efficient, and high-precision alternative to existing models.

Motivation: 研究神经网络组合结构对优化景观和训练动态的影响，理解过参数化优化问题的收敛特性。

Method: 分析过参数化优化问题的梯度流，将其解释为训练具有线性激活的神经网络，使用适当的实解析代价函数进行理论分析。

Result: 证明了全局收敛性，发现鞍点的位置和稳定性等结构特征在所有允许的代价函数中具有普遍性，收敛速度可根据初始化的不平衡度量任意加速。

Conclusion: 神经网络组合结构在优化中起关键作用，这些见解可推广到具有sigmoid激活的神经网络，几何和动态特性在线性情况之外仍然存在。

Abstract: This paper investigates how the compositional structure of neural networks shapes their optimization landscape and training dynamics. We analyze the gradient flow associated with overparameterized optimization problems, which can be interpreted as training a neural network with linear activations. Remarkably, we show that the global convergence properties can be derived for any cost function that is proper and real analytic. We then specialize the analysis to scalar-valued cost functions, where the geometry of the landscape can be fully characterized. In this setting, we demonstrate that key structural features -- such as the location and stability of saddle points -- are universal across all admissible costs, depending solely on the overparameterized representation rather than on problem-specific details. Moreover, we show that convergence can be arbitrarily accelerated depending on the initialization, as measured by an imbalance metric introduced in this work. Finally, we discuss how these insights may generalize to neural networks with sigmoidal activations, showing through a simple example which geometric and dynamical properties persist beyond the linear case.

Motivation: 传统数值方法求解偏微分方程成本高昂，而现有的深度学习代理模型通常只针对单一固定参数的PDE，缺乏泛化能力。

Method: 开发了方程感知仿真框架，使用向量编码表示PDE的项和系数，并作为神经模型的输入条件。在APEBench套件的1D PDE族上训练了四种不同的建模技术。

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了AI系统自动化创建专家级科学任务经验软件的能力，为PDE求解提供了可泛化的深度学习解决方案。

Abstract: Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) can be prohibitively expensive using traditional numerical methods. Deep learning-based surrogate models typically specialize in a single PDE with fixed parameters. We present a framework for equation-aware emulation that generalizes to unseen PDEs, conditioning a neural model on a vector encoding representing the terms in a PDE and their coefficients. We present a baseline of four distinct modeling technqiues, trained on a family of 1D PDEs from the APEBench suite. Our approach achieves strong performance on parameter sets held out from the training distribution, with strong stability for rollout beyond the training window, and generalization to an entirely unseen PDE. This work was developed as part of a broader effort exploring AI systems that automate the creation of expert-level empirical software for scorable scientific tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决雷达降水临近预报中的两个关键挑战：大气动力学的不确定性和高维数据的高效建模，同时克服扩散模型计算成本高的问题。

Method: 采用条件流匹配方法学习从噪声到数据的直接映射，相比扩散模型显著减少了函数评估次数。

Result: 实验表明FlowCast在预测准确性上达到新SOTA，CFM目标比相同架构上的扩散目标更准确且显著更高效，在显著减少采样步骤的同时保持高性能。

Conclusion: 条件流匹配是高维时空预报中强大且实用的替代方案。

Abstract: Radar-based precipitation nowcasting, the task of forecasting short-term precipitation fields from previous radar images, is a critical problem for flood risk management and decision-making. While deep learning has substantially advanced this field, two challenges remain fundamental: the uncertainty of atmospheric dynamics and the efficient modeling of high-dimensional data. Diffusion models have shown strong promise by producing sharp, reliable forecasts, but their iterative sampling process is computationally prohibitive for time-critical applications. We introduce FlowCast, the first model to apply Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) to precipitation nowcasting. Unlike diffusion, CFM learns a direct noise-to-data mapping, enabling rapid, high-fidelity sample generation with drastically fewer function evaluations. Our experiments demonstrate that FlowCast establishes a new state-of-the-art in predictive accuracy. A direct comparison further reveals the CFM objective is both more accurate and significantly more efficient than a diffusion objective on the same architecture, maintaining high performance with significantly fewer sampling steps. This work positions CFM as a powerful and practical alternative for high-dimensional spatiotemporal forecasting.

TL;DR: 本文研究了Split Federated Learning (SFL)中数据异构性导致的灾难性遗忘现象，并提出了一种名为Hydra的缓解方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在SFL中，由于模型被分割为两部分分别训练，第1部分在客户端本地训练可能偏离全局最优解，而第2部分在服务器端顺序处理中间激活值，类似于持续学习中的遗忘现象，导致模型对序列末尾出现的类别表现更好。

Method: 提出了Hydra方法，受多头神经网络启发并适应SFL设置。该方法通过多头部结构来缓解灾难性遗忘问题。

Result: 广泛的数值评估表明，Hydra方法在性能上优于基线方法和文献中的其他方法。

Conclusion: Hydra方法能有效缓解SFL中的灾难性遗忘问题，特别是在数据异构环境下表现出优越性能。

Abstract: In Split Federated Learning (SFL), the clients collaboratively train a model with the help of a server by splitting the model into two parts. Part-1 is trained locally at each client and aggregated by the aggregator at the end of each round. Part-2 is trained at a server that sequentially processes the intermediate activations received from each client. We study the phenomenon of catastrophic forgetting (CF) in SFL in the presence of data heterogeneity. In detail, due to the nature of SFL, local updates of part-1 may drift away from global optima, while part-2 is sensitive to the processing sequence, similar to forgetting in continual learning (CL). Specifically, we observe that the trained model performs better in classes (labels) seen at the end of the sequence. We investigate this phenomenon with emphasis on key aspects of SFL, such as the processing order at the server and the cut layer. Based on our findings, we propose Hydra, a novel mitigation method inspired by multi-head neural networks and adapted for the SFL's setting. Extensive numerical evaluations show that Hydra outperforms baselines and methods from the literature.

TL;DR: 提出了SPARC方法，通过单阶段训练实现强化学习在分布外环境中的鲁棒泛化，简化了现有两阶段方法的复杂性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器人和控制领域中的泛化挑战，特别是在上下文强化学习中，智能体需要在与训练环境不同的上下文（如不同地形、天气条件）中操作，且测试时无法获取明确的上下文信息。

Method: 引入SPARC（单阶段适应鲁棒控制）方法，简化了现有的两阶段训练方法（上下文编码器和历史适应模块分离训练），采用单阶段训练策略。

Result: 在高保真赛车模拟器Gran Turismo 7和风扰动的MuJoCo环境中测试，SPARC实现了可靠且鲁棒的分布外泛化性能。

Conclusion: SPARC方法通过简化的单阶段训练流程，在复杂环境中实现了有效的分布外泛化，为上下文强化学习的实际应用提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Generalization to unseen environments is a significant challenge in the field of robotics and control. In this work, we focus on contextual reinforcement learning, where agents act within environments with varying contexts, such as self-driving cars or quadrupedal robots that need to operate in different terrains or weather conditions than they were trained for. We tackle the critical task of generalizing to out-of-distribution (OOD) settings, without access to explicit context information at test time. Recent work has addressed this problem by training a context encoder and a history adaptation module in separate stages. While promising, this two-phase approach is cumbersome to implement and train. We simplify the methodology and introduce SPARC: single-phase adaptation for robust control. We test SPARC on varying contexts within the high-fidelity racing simulator Gran Turismo 7 and wind-perturbed MuJoCo environments, and find that it achieves reliable and robust OOD generalization.

*Houming Wu,Ling Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TawPipe是一种拓扑感知的权重流水线并行方法，利用分布式集群中的分层带宽来优化通信效率，在长文本训练中比现有方法具有更好的吞吐量和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练大型语言模型受限于设备内存和昂贵的设备间通信。流水线并行虽然缓解了内存压力，但会带来随序列长度线性增长的激活通信开销。现有的权重传递方法虽然减少了通信量，但存在冗余的点对点传输和节点内带宽利用不足的问题。

Method: TawPipe通过以下方式优化通信效率：(1)基于拓扑对设备分组，优化节点内集体通信和节点间点对点通信；(2)为每个设备分配固定的模型权重和梯度分片，避免冗余传输；(3)将通信与计算重叠以隐藏延迟。

Result: 在最多24个GPU上使用LLaMA风格模型进行的广泛实验表明，与最先进的基线方法相比，TawPipe实现了更优的吞吐量和可扩展性。

Conclusion: TawPipe通过利用集群拓扑结构，将大部分通信限制在节点边界内，显著减少了跨节点流量，为大规模语言模型训练提供了一种高效的并行策略。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) is fundamentally constrained by limited device memory and costly inter-device communication. Although pipeline parallelism alleviates memory pressure by partitioning models across devices, it incurs activation communication overhead that scales linearly with sequence length, limiting efficiency in long-context training. Recent weight-passing approaches (e.g., WeiPipe) mitigate this by transmitting model weights instead of activations, but suffer from redundant peer-to-peer (P2P) transfers and underutilized intra-node bandwidth. We propose TawPipe--topology-aware weight pipeline parallelism, which exploits hierarchical bandwidth in distributed clusters for improved communication efficiency. TawPipe: (i) groups devices based on topology to optimize intra-node collective and inter-node P2P communication; (ii) assigns each device a fixed shard of model weights and gradients, avoiding redundant transfers; and (iii) overlaps communication with computation to hide latency. Unlike global collective operations used in fully sharded data parallelism (FSDP), TawPipe confines most communication within node boundaries, significantly reducing cross-node traffic. Extensive experiments on up to 24 GPUs with LLaMA-style models show that TawPipe achieves superior throughput and scalability compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于宏观情境检索的金融预测框架，通过检索历史类似宏观经济情境来增强预测的稳健性，在分布外测试中显著优于传统多模态方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融市场具有非平稳性，结构性断裂和宏观经济体制转变常导致传统预测模型在分布外部署时失效。现有融合数值指标和文本情感的多模态方法难以适应这种变化。

Method: 引入宏观情境检索框架，将宏观指标（CPI、失业率、收益率利差、GDP增长等）和金融新闻情感共同嵌入共享相似性空间，在推理时无需重新训练即可检索历史类似宏观经济情境。

Result: 在17年S&P 500数据上训练，在AAPL和XOM的分布外测试中显著缩小CV到OOD性能差距，获得唯一正向样本外交易结果（AAPL: PF=1.18, Sharpe=0.95; XOM: PF=1.16, Sharpe=0.61）。

Conclusion: 宏观感知检索能够产生在分布变化下稳健且可解释的预测，检索到的相似情境形成可解释的证据链，对应可识别的宏观情境（如通胀或收益率曲线倒挂阶段）。

Abstract: Financial markets are inherently non-stationary: structural breaks and macroeconomic regime shifts often cause forecasting models to fail when deployed out of distribution (OOD). Conventional multimodal approaches that simply fuse numerical indicators and textual sentiment rarely adapt to such shifts. We introduce macro-contextual retrieval, a retrieval-augmented forecasting framework that grounds each prediction in historically analogous macroeconomic regimes. The method jointly embeds macro indicators (e.g., CPI, unemployment, yield spread, GDP growth) and financial news sentiment in a shared similarity space, enabling causal retrieval of precedent periods during inference without retraining.
  Trained on seventeen years of S&P 500 data (2007-2023) and evaluated OOD on AAPL (2024) and XOM (2024), the framework consistently narrows the CV to OOD performance gap. Macro-conditioned retrieval achieves the only positive out-of-sample trading outcomes (AAPL: PF=1.18, Sharpe=0.95; XOM: PF=1.16, Sharpe=0.61), while static numeric, text-only, and naive multimodal baselines collapse under regime shifts. Beyond metric gains, retrieved neighbors form interpretable evidence chains that correspond to recognizable macro contexts, such as inflationary or yield-curve inversion phases, supporting causal interpretability and transparency. By operationalizing the principle that "financial history may not repeat, but it often rhymes," this work demonstrates that macro-aware retrieval yields robust, explainable forecasts under distributional change.
  All datasets, models, and source code are publicly available.

Motivation: 研究计算高效算法在不同对抗性噪声模型下的相对能力和局限性，特别是比较恶意噪声和恶意噪声两种具有挑战性的噪声模型，以理解噪声容忍度在不同学习设置中的差异。

Method: 采用理论分析方法，在分布无关和固定分布两种设置下，通过数学证明和密码学假设来比较恶意噪声和恶意噪声的容忍度关系，并定义了一类忽略矛盾示例（ICE）的算法来研究其噪声容忍特性。

Result: 在分布无关学习中，恶意噪声和恶意噪声具有强等价性；在固定分布学习中，两种噪声容忍度存在任意大的分离；对于ICE算法，两种噪声容忍度相差最多2倍。

Conclusion: 学习设置对噪声容忍度有重要影响，分布无关学习中两种噪声模型等价，固定分布学习中存在显著差异，而ICE算法能在两种噪声间提供有界的转换关系。

Abstract: We consider the relative abilities and limitations of computationally efficient algorithms for learning in the presence of noise, under two well-studied and challenging adversarial noise models for learning Boolean functions: malicious noise, in which an adversary can arbitrarily corrupt a random subset of examples given to the learner; and nasty noise, in which an adversary can arbitrarily corrupt an adversarially chosen subset of examples given to the learner.
  We consider both the distribution-independent and fixed-distribution settings. Our main results highlight a dramatic difference between these two settings: For distribution-independent learning, we prove a strong equivalence between the two noise models: If a class ${\cal C}$ of functions is efficiently learnable in the presence of $η$-rate malicious noise, then it is also efficiently learnable in the presence of $η$-rate nasty noise. In sharp contrast, for the fixed-distribution setting we show an arbitrarily large separation: Under a standard cryptographic assumption, for any arbitrarily large value $r$ there exists a concept class for which there is a ratio of $r$ between the rate $η_{malicious}$ of malicious noise that polynomial-time learning algorithms can tolerate, versus the rate $η_{nasty}$ of nasty noise that such learning algorithms can tolerate.
  To offset the negative result for the fixed-distribution setting, we define a broad and natural class of algorithms, namely those that ignore contradictory examples (ICE). We show that for these algorithms, malicious noise and nasty noise are equivalent up to a factor of two in the noise rate: Any efficient ICE learner that succeeds with $η$-rate malicious noise can be converted to an efficient learner that succeeds with $η/2$-rate nasty noise. We further show that the above factor of two is necessary, again under a standard cryptographic assumption.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有自动睡眠分期方法在时间层次表达、多模态EEG和EOG融合以及深度学习模型可解释性方面的局限性。

Method: 将30秒epoch分解为3秒子窗口作为token，使用CNN分词器和双级Transformer（段内编码和段间集成），通过图卷积网络融合EEG和EOG模态特征。

Result: 在Sleep-EDF数据集上达到85.3%准确率、0.800宏F1和0.796 Cohen's kappa，在ISRUC数据集上达到81.9%准确率、0.802宏F1和0.755 kappa。

Conclusion: 通过将睡眠建模为组合语言，NeuroLingua统一了层次序列建模和多模态融合，为睡眠研究提供了更透明和临床意义的自动分期方法。

Abstract: Automated sleep stage classification from polysomnography remains limited by the lack of expressive temporal hierarchies, challenges in multimodal EEG and EOG fusion, and the limited interpretability of deep learning models. We propose NeuroLingua, a language-inspired framework that conceptualizes sleep as a structured physiological language. Each 30-second epoch is decomposed into overlapping 3-second subwindows ("tokens") using a CNN-based tokenizer, enabling hierarchical temporal modeling through dual-level Transformers: intra-segment encoding of local dependencies and inter-segment integration across seven consecutive epochs (3.5 minutes) for extended context. Modality-specific embeddings from EEG and EOG channels are fused via a Graph Convolutional Network, facilitating robust multimodal integration. NeuroLingua is evaluated on the Sleep-EDF Expanded and ISRUC-Sleep datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results on Sleep-EDF (85.3% accuracy, 0.800 macro F1, and 0.796 Cohen's kappa) and competitive performance on ISRUC (81.9% accuracy, 0.802 macro F1, and 0.755 kappa), matching or exceeding published baselines in overall and per-class metrics. The architecture's attention mechanisms enhance the detection of clinically relevant sleep microevents, providing a principled foundation for future interpretability, explainability, and causal inference in sleep research. By framing sleep as a compositional language, NeuroLingua unifies hierarchical sequence modeling and multimodal fusion, advancing automated sleep staging toward more transparent and clinically meaningful applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO在大型语言模型后训练中表现出色，但其去中心化特性使其容易受到恶意节点的攻击。本文旨在揭示这种安全漏洞并探索防御方法。

Method: 通过实证研究，在数学和编程任务中实施上下文内和上下文外攻击，恶意节点注入任意恶意令牌来毒化良性节点的本地LLM后训练。

Result: 攻击在50次迭代内就能达到100%的成功率，有效污染良性节点的本地训练过程。

Conclusion: 虽然GRPO容易受到对抗攻击，但提出的两种防御策略（针对相同模型和不同模型训练场景）可以实现高达100%的阻止率，使攻击变得不可能。

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has demonstrated great utilization in post-training of Large Language Models (LLMs). In GRPO, prompts are answered by the model and, through reinforcement learning, preferred completions are learnt. Owing to the small communication volume, GRPO is inherently suitable for decentralised training as the prompts can be concurrently answered by multiple nodes and then exchanged in the forms of strings. In this work, we present the first adversarial attack in decentralised GRPO. We demonstrate that malicious parties can poison such systems by injecting arbitrary malicious tokens in benign models in both out-of-context and in-context attacks. Using empirical examples of math and coding tasks, we show that adversarial attacks can easily poison the benign nodes, polluting their local LLM post-training, achieving attack success rates up to 100% in as few as 50 iterations. We propose two ways to defend against these attacks, depending on whether all users train the same model or different models. We show that these defenses can achieve stop rates of up to 100%, making the attack impossible.

Conclusion: 阐明了JEPA的关键行为，为现代自监督学习与动力系统理论建立了原理性联系，指导设计更鲁棒和可解释的时间序列模型。

Abstract: Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs), a powerful class of self-supervised models, exhibit an unexplained ability to cluster time-series data by their underlying dynamical regimes. We propose a novel theoretical explanation for this phenomenon, hypothesizing that JEPA's predictive objective implicitly drives it to learn the invariant subspace of the system's Koopman operator. We prove that an idealized JEPA loss is minimized when the encoder represents the system's regime indicator functions, which are Koopman eigenfunctions. This theory was validated on synthetic data with known dynamics, demonstrating that constraining the JEPA's linear predictor to be a near-identity operator is the key inductive bias that forces the encoder to learn these invariants. We further discuss that this constraint is critical for selecting this interpretable solution from a class of mathematically equivalent but entangled optima, revealing the predictor's role in representation disentanglement. This work demystifies a key behavior of JEPAs, provides a principled connection between modern self-supervised learning and dynamical systems theory, and informs the design of more robust and interpretable time-series models.

Conclusion: CaReTS框架通过解耦宏观趋势和微观偏差，提供了更可解释的预测，在多步时间序列预测问题上表现出色。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep forecasting models have achieved remarkable performance, yet most approaches still struggle to provide both accurate predictions and interpretable insights into temporal dynamics. This paper proposes CaReTS, a novel multi-task learning framework that combines classification and regression tasks for multi-step time series forecasting problems. The framework adopts a dual-stream architecture, where a classification branch learns the stepwise trend into the future, while a regression branch estimates the corresponding deviations from the latest observation of the target variable. The dual-stream design provides more interpretable predictions by disentangling macro-level trends from micro-level deviations in the target variable. To enable effective learning in output prediction, deviation estimation, and trend classification, we design a multi-task loss with uncertainty-aware weighting to adaptively balance the contribution of each task. Furthermore, four variants (CaReTS1--4) are instantiated under this framework to incorporate mainstream temporal modelling encoders, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long short-term memory networks (LSTMs), and Transformers. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that CaReTS outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms in forecasting accuracy, while achieving higher trend classification performance.

Conclusion: 非单调值分解无需单调性约束即可稳定收敛到最优解，为基于值的MARL算法设计提供了新的理论依据和实践指导。

Abstract: Value decomposition is a central approach in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), enabling centralized training with decentralized execution by factorizing the global value function into local values. To ensure individual-global-max (IGM) consistency, existing methods either enforce monotonicity constraints, which limit expressive power, or adopt softer surrogates at the cost of algorithmic complexity. In this work, we present a dynamical systems analysis of non-monotonic value decomposition, modeling learning dynamics as continuous-time gradient flow. We prove that, under approximately greedy exploration, all zero-loss equilibria violating IGM consistency are unstable saddle points, while only IGM-consistent solutions are stable attractors of the learning dynamics. Extensive experiments on both synthetic matrix games and challenging MARL benchmarks demonstrate that unconstrained, non-monotonic factorization reliably recovers IGM-optimal solutions and consistently outperforms monotonic baselines. Additionally, we investigate the influence of temporal-difference targets and exploration strategies, providing actionable insights for the design of future value-based MARL algorithms.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了带可行性约束的最佳臂识别问题，提出了一种高效的算法，能够自适应地选择测试性能或可行性，并证明了算法的渐近最优性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的最佳臂识别问题通常需要满足额外的可行性约束，且性能和可行性测试往往可以分开进行（如药物发现中效力和毒性测试），而现有方法假设两者同时观察，不符合实际应用场景。

Method: 提出了一种算法，允许决策者在每个时间步选择臂和测试类型（性能或某个可行性约束），基于固定置信度设置识别具有最高性能的可行臂。

Result: 算法能够自适应问题难度，通过较差的性能或不可行性来消除臂，在合成和真实数据集上优于现有BAI算法。

Conclusion: 所提算法在带可行性约束的BAI问题中是渐近最优的，能够有效处理性能和可行性测试分离的实际场景。

Abstract: Best arm identification (BAI) aims to identify the highest-performance arm among a set of $K$ arms by collecting stochastic samples from each arm. In real-world problems, the best arm needs to satisfy additional feasibility constraints. While there is limited prior work on BAI with feasibility constraints, they typically assume the performance and constraints are observed simultaneously on each pull of an arm. However, this assumption does not reflect most practical use cases, e.g., in drug discovery, we wish to find the most potent drug whose toxicity and solubility are below certain safety thresholds. These safety experiments can be conducted separately from the potency measurement. Thus, this requires designing BAI algorithms that not only decide which arm to pull but also decide whether to test for the arm's performance or feasibility. In this work, we study feasible BAI which allows a decision-maker to choose a tuple $(i,\ell)$, where $i\in [K]$ denotes an arm and $\ell$ denotes whether she wishes to test for its performance ($\ell=0$) or any of its $N$ feasibility constraints ($\ell\in[N]$). We focus on the fixed confidence setting, which is to identify the \textit{feasible} arm with the \textit{highest performance}, with a probability of at least $1-δ$. We propose an efficient algorithm and upper-bound its sample complexity, showing our algorithm can naturally adapt to the problem's difficulty and eliminate arms by worse performance or infeasibility, whichever is easier. We complement this upper bound with a lower bound showing that our algorithm is \textit{asymptotically ($δ\rightarrow 0$) optimal}. Finally, we empirically show that our algorithm outperforms other state-of-the-art BAI algorithms in both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Motivation: 解决联邦学习中数据异构性导致的梯度发散问题，提升全局模型的收敛速度和准确率。

Method: 设计了Step-wise Momentum Fusion框架，通过同步服务器端优化器的动量缓冲区，并采用staleness-aware对齐机制控制训练过程中的梯度发散。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上的验证显示，SMoFi能显著提升全局模型准确率（最高7.1%）和收敛速度（最高10.25倍），且在客户端数量越多、模型越深时效果越明显。

Conclusion: SMoFi特别适合资源受限环境下的模型训练，能有效应对数据异构性挑战。

Abstract: Split Federated Learning is a system-efficient federated learning paradigm that leverages the rich computing resources at a central server to train model partitions. Data heterogeneity across silos, however, presents a major challenge undermining the convergence speed and accuracy of the global model. This paper introduces Step-wise Momentum Fusion (SMoFi), an effective and lightweight framework that counteracts gradient divergence arising from data heterogeneity by synchronizing the momentum buffers across server-side optimizers. To control gradient divergence over the training process, we design a staleness-aware alignment mechanism that imposes constraints on gradient updates of the server-side submodel at each optimization step. Extensive validations on multiple real-world datasets show that SMoFi consistently improves global model accuracy (up to 7.1%) and convergence speed (up to 10.25$\times$). Furthermore, SMoFi has a greater impact with more clients involved and deeper learning models, making it particularly suitable for model training in resource-constrained contexts.

*Ilias Diakonikolas,Mingchen Ma,Lisheng Ren,Christos Tzamos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的算法，能够绕过CSQ（相关统计查询）的硬度障碍，在满足因子化假设的分布下，以多项式时间学习两个半空间的交集，而CSQ方法即使在弱学习情况下也需要拟多项式时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学习半空间交集是计算学习理论中的核心问题。即使对于两个半空间，是否能在多项式时间内学习仍是一个主要开放问题。现有最佳算法需要拟多项式时间，且已证明仅依赖CSQ的算法无法避免这种复杂度。

Method: 采用新颖的对偶框架分析边际分布诱导的矩张量结构，结合改进的Jennrich算法、随机投影下的PCA以及基于梯度下降的非凸优化框架。

Result: 在因子化分布下，CSQ方法需要拟多项式时间进行弱学习，而本文算法能在poly(d,1/γ)时间内完成学习，建立了CSQ与SQ之间的强分离。

Conclusion: 本文证明了在因子化分布假设下，SQ方法能够显著超越CSQ方法的学习效率，为学习两个半空间交集提供了第一个多项式时间算法。

Abstract: Learning intersections of halfspaces is a central problem in Computational Learning Theory. Even for just two halfspaces, it remains a major open question whether learning is possible in polynomial time with respect to the margin $γ$ of the data points and their dimensionality $d$. The best-known algorithms run in quasi-polynomial time $d^{O(\log(1/γ))}$, and it has been shown that this complexity is unavoidable for any algorithm relying solely on correlational statistical queries (CSQ).
  In this work, we introduce a novel algorithm that provably circumvents the CSQ hardness barrier. Our approach applies to a broad class of distributions satisfying a natural, previously studied, factorizability assumption. Factorizable distributions lie between distribution-specific and distribution-free settings, and significantly extend previously known tractable cases. Under these distributions, we show that CSQ-based methods still require quasipolynomial time even for weakly learning, whereas our algorithm achieves $poly(d,1/γ)$ time by leveraging more general statistical queries (SQ), establishing a strong separation between CSQ and SQ for this simple realizable PAC learning problem.
  Our result is grounded in a rigorous analysis utilizing a novel duality framework that characterizes the moment tensor structure induced by the marginal distributions. Building on these structural insights, we propose new, efficient learning algorithms. These algorithms combine a refined variant of Jennrich's Algorithm with PCA over random projections of the moment tensor, along with a gradient-descent-based non-convex optimization framework.

Motivation: 解决监督学习依赖高质量标注数据但人工标注成本高、耗时长的问题，以及现有LLM标注质量仍低于人类水平的问题。

Method: 提出ACT数据管道，让LLMs既作为标注者又作为评审者，批判性识别潜在错误，人工只需审查最可疑的案例。

Conclusion: ACT方法在NLP、CV和多模态理解等多个领域都适用，通过理论分析和实验验证了其有效性，并提供了用户友好的指导方针。

Abstract: Supervised learning relies on high-quality labeled data, but obtaining such data through human annotation is both expensive and time-consuming. Recent work explores using large language models (LLMs) for annotation, but LLM-generated labels still fall short of human-level quality. To address this problem, we propose the Annotation with Critical Thinking (ACT) data pipeline, where LLMs serve not only as annotators but also as judges to critically identify potential errors. Human effort is then directed towards reviewing only the most "suspicious" cases, significantly improving the human annotation efficiency. Our major contributions are as follows: (1) ACT is applicable to a wide range of domains, including natural language processing (NLP), computer vision (CV), and multimodal understanding, by leveraging multimodal-LLMs (MLLMs). (2) Through empirical studies, we derive 7 insights on how to enhance annotation quality while efficiently reducing the human cost, and then translate these findings into user-friendly guidelines. (3) We theoretically analyze how to modify the loss function so that models trained on ACT data achieve similar performance to those trained on fully human-annotated data. Our experiments show that the performance gap can be reduced to less than 2% on most benchmark datasets while saving up to 90% of human costs.

TL;DR: 提出一种轻量级动态对齐机制，通过从验证器隐藏状态计算转向向量并注入预训练起草器，显著提升接受率，同时计算开销可忽略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推测解码的主要限制是起草器-验证器不对齐，这限制了令牌接受并降低整体效果。预训练起草器虽然较慢但接受率更高，在起草延迟相对于验证或通信开销可忽略时具有竞争力。

Method: 引入轻量级动态对齐机制：从验证器隐藏状态计算转向向量并注入预训练起草器，相比现有离线对齐方法（如蒸馏）具有更好效果。

Result: 在标准采样下接受令牌数量提升高达35%，贪婪采样下提升22%，计算开销可忽略。

Conclusion: 该方法可改造现有架构和预训练模型，实现快速采用，显著提升推测解码性能。

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates language model inference by separating generation into fast drafting and parallel verification. Its main limitation is drafter-verifier misalignment, which limits token acceptance and reduces overall effectiveness. While small drafting heads trained from scratch compensate with speed, they struggle when verification dominates latency or when inputs are out of distribution. In contrast, pretrained drafters, though slower, achieve higher acceptance rates thanks to stronger standalone generation capabilities, making them competitive when drafting latency is negligible relative to verification or communication overhead. In this work, we aim to improve the acceptance rates of pretrained drafters by introducing a lightweight dynamic alignment mechanism: a steering vector computed from the verifier's hidden states and injected into the pretrained drafter. Compared to existing offline alignment methods such as distillation, our approach boosts the number of accepted tokens by up to 35\% under standard sampling and 22\% under greedy sampling, all while incurring negligible computational overhead. Importantly, our approach can be retrofitted to existing architectures and pretrained models, enabling rapid adoption.

Conclusion: ConSurv成功解决了多模态持续学习中的灾难性遗忘和复杂模态交互问题，为临床生存预测提供了有效的动态学习方案。

Abstract: Survival prediction of cancers is crucial for clinical practice, as it informs mortality risks and influences treatment plans. However, a static model trained on a single dataset fails to adapt to the dynamically evolving clinical environment and continuous data streams, limiting its practical utility. While continual learning (CL) offers a solution to learn dynamically from new datasets, existing CL methods primarily focus on unimodal inputs and suffer from severe catastrophic forgetting in survival prediction. In real-world scenarios, multimodal inputs often provide comprehensive and complementary information, such as whole slide images and genomics; and neglecting inter-modal correlations negatively impacts the performance. To address the two challenges of catastrophic forgetting and complex inter-modal interactions between gigapixel whole slide images and genomics, we propose ConSurv, the first multimodal continual learning (MMCL) method for survival analysis. ConSurv incorporates two key components: Multi-staged Mixture of Experts (MS-MoE) and Feature Constrained Replay (FCR). MS-MoE captures both task-shared and task-specific knowledge at different learning stages of the network, including two modality encoders and the modality fusion component, learning inter-modal relationships. FCR further enhances learned knowledge and mitigates forgetting by restricting feature deviation of previous data at different levels, including encoder-level features of two modalities and the fusion-level representations. Additionally, we introduce a new benchmark integrating four datasets, Multimodal Survival Analysis Incremental Learning (MSAIL), for comprehensive evaluation in the CL setting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConSurv outperforms competing methods across multiple metrics.

Abstract: The growing use of large language models in sensitive domains has exposed a critical weakness: the inability to ensure that private information can be permanently forgotten. Yet these systems still lack reliable mechanisms to guarantee that sensitive information can be permanently removed once it has been used. Retraining from the beginning is prohibitively costly, and existing unlearning methods remain fragmented, difficult to verify, and often vulnerable to recovery. This paper surveys recent research on machine unlearning for LLMs and considers how far current approaches can address these challenges. We review methods for evaluating whether forgetting has occurred, the resilience of unlearned models against adversarial attacks, and mechanisms that can support user trust when model complexity or proprietary limits restrict transparency. Technical solutions such as differential privacy, homomorphic encryption, federated learning, and ephemeral memory are examined alongside institutional safeguards including auditing practices and regulatory frameworks. The review finds steady progress, but robust and verifiable unlearning is still unresolved. Efficient techniques that avoid costly retraining, stronger defenses against adversarial recovery, and governance structures that reinforce accountability are needed if LLMs are to be deployed safely in sensitive applications. By integrating technical and organizational perspectives, this study outlines a pathway toward AI systems that can be required to forget, while maintaining both privacy and public trust.

Motivation: RL微调过程不稳定且检查点性能差异大，传统方法要么计算成本高（验证集评估），要么不可靠（仅依赖最终检查点），需要更有效的检查点选择策略。

Method: 使用样本级不确定性识别困难问答对，通过在短训练窗口内对高不确定性样本的奖励进行平均，生成稳定且区分性强的信号来排名检查点。

Result: 在三个数据集和三个大语言模型上的实验表明，该方法能一致性地选择具有更强泛化能力的检查点，优于依赖训练或验证性能的传统策略。

Conclusion: 能够以低不确定性解决最困难任务的模型是最可靠的，基于不确定性的检查点选择方法提供了有效的模型评估策略。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) finetuning is crucial to aligning large language models (LLMs), but the process is notoriously unstable and exhibits high variance across model checkpoints. In practice, selecting the best checkpoint is challenging: evaluating checkpoints on the validation set during training is computationally expensive and requires a good validation set, while relying on the final checkpoint provides no guarantee of good performance. We introduce an uncertainty-guided approach for checkpoint selection (UGCS) that avoids these pitfalls. Our method identifies hard question-answer pairs using per-sample uncertainty and ranks checkpoints by how well they handle these challenging cases. By averaging the rewards of the top-uncertain samples over a short training window, our method produces a stable and discriminative signal without additional forward passes or significant computation overhead. Experiments across three datasets and three LLMs demonstrate that it consistently identifies checkpoints with stronger generalization, outperforming traditional strategies such as relying on training or validation performance. These results highlight that models solving their hardest tasks with low uncertainty are the most reliable overall.

Conclusion: 通过有效整合和利用知识，该方法能提高序列任务的平均性能，产生的特征提取结果最接近上限，为持续学习设立了新里程碑。

Abstract: Continual learning methods used to force neural networks to process sequential tasks in isolation, preventing them from leveraging useful inter-task relationships and causing them to repeatedly relearn similar features or overly differentiate them. To address this problem, we propose a fully differentiable, exemplar-free expandable method composed of two complementary memories: One learns common features that can be used across all tasks, and the other combines the shared features to learn discriminative characteristics unique to each sample. Both memories are differentiable so that the network can autonomously learn latent representations for each sample. For each task, the memory adjustment module adaptively prunes critical slots and minimally expands capacity to accommodate new concepts, and orthogonal regularization enforces geometric separation between preserved and newly learned memory components to prevent interference. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet show that the proposed method outperforms 14 state-of-the-art methods for class-incremental learning, achieving final accuracies of 55.13\%, 37.24\%, and 30.11\%, respectively. Additional analysis confirms that, through effective integration and utilization of knowledge, the proposed method can increase average performance across sequential tasks, and it produces feature extraction results closest to the upper bound, thus establishing a new milestone in continual learning.

Abstract: Fair clustering is crucial for mitigating bias in unsupervised learning, yet existing algorithms often suffer from quadratic or super-quadratic computational complexity, rendering them impractical for large-scale datasets. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Anchor-based Fair Clustering Framework (AFCF), a novel, general, and plug-and-play framework that empowers arbitrary fair clustering algorithms with linear-time scalability. Our approach first selects a small but representative set of anchors using a novel fair sampling strategy. Then, any off-the-shelf fair clustering algorithm can be applied to this small anchor set. The core of our framework lies in a novel anchor graph construction module, where we formulate an optimization problem to propagate labels while preserving fairness. This is achieved through a carefully designed group-label joint constraint, which we prove theoretically ensures that the fairness of the final clustering on the entire dataset matches that of the anchor clustering. We solve this optimization efficiently using an ADMM-based algorithm. Extensive experiments on multiple large-scale benchmarks demonstrate that AFCF drastically accelerates state-of-the-art methods, which reduces computational time by orders of magnitude while maintaining strong clustering performance and fairness guarantees.

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of mortality worldwide. Electrocardiograms (ECGs) are the most widely used non-invasive tool for cardiac assessment, yet large, well-annotated ECG corpora are scarce due to cost, privacy, and workflow constraints. Generating ECGs can be beneficial for the mechanistic understanding of cardiac electrical activity, enable the construction of large, heterogeneous, and unbiased datasets, and facilitate privacy-preserving data sharing. Generating realistic ECG signals from clinical context is important yet underexplored. Recent work has leveraged diffusion models for text-to-ECG generation, but two challenges remain: (i) existing methods often overlook the physiological simulator knowledge of cardiac activity; and (ii) they ignore broader, experience-based clinical knowledge grounded in real-world practice. To address these gaps, we propose SE-Diff, a novel physiological simulator and experience enhanced diffusion model for comprehensive ECG generation. SE-Diff integrates a lightweight ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based ECG simulator into the diffusion process via a beat decoder and simulator-consistent constraints, injecting mechanistic priors that promote physiologically plausible waveforms. In parallel, we design an LLM-powered experience retrieval-augmented strategy to inject clinical knowledge, providing more guidance for ECG generation. Extensive experiments on real-world ECG datasets demonstrate that SE-Diff improves both signal fidelity and text-ECG semantic alignment over baselines, proving its superiority for text-to-ECG generation. We further show that the simulator-based and experience-based knowledge also benefit downstream ECG classification.

Abstract: Modern deep neural networks rely heavily on massive model weights and training samples, incurring substantial computational costs. Weight pruning and coreset selection are two emerging paradigms proposed to improve computational efficiency. In this paper, we first explore the interplay between redundant weights and training samples through a transparent analysis: redundant samples, particularly noisy ones, cause model weights to become unnecessarily overtuned to fit them, complicating the identification of irrelevant weights during pruning; conversely, irrelevant weights tend to overfit noisy data, undermining coreset selection effectiveness. To further investigate and harness this interplay in deep learning, we develop a Simultaneous Weight and Sample Tailoring mechanism (SWaST) that alternately performs weight pruning and coreset selection to establish a synergistic effect in training. During this investigation, we observe that when simultaneously removing a large number of weights and samples, a phenomenon we term critical double-loss can occur, where important weights and their supportive samples are mistakenly eliminated at the same time, leading to model instability and nearly irreversible degradation that cannot be recovered in subsequent training. Unlike classic machine learning models, this issue can arise in deep learning due to the lack of theoretical guarantees on the correctness of weight pruning and coreset selection, which explains why these paradigms are often developed independently. We mitigate this by integrating a state preservation mechanism into SWaST, enabling stable joint optimization. Extensive experiments reveal a strong synergy between pruning and coreset selection across varying prune rates and coreset sizes, delivering accuracy boosts of up to 17.83% alongside 10% to 90% FLOPs reductions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文证明了增量生成在基于流的生成模型中是必要且充分的，建立了严格的逼近理论基础。通过拓扑动力学论证，证明了单步自洽流无法通用逼近，但通过组合多个流可以实现通用逼近。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于流的增量去噪模型在生成建模中表现出色，但缺乏严格的逼近理论基础。本文旨在为这类模型建立数学基础，证明增量生成的必要性和充分性。

Method: 使用拓扑动力学论证证明单步自洽流的局限性，然后利用自洽流的代数性质，通过组合多个流来实现对方向保持同胚的逼近。通过线性提升维度，获得对连续函数和概率测度的通用逼近结果。

Result: 证明了单步自洽流在方向保持同胚空间中是贫集且非通用的，但组合多个流可以实现对Lipschitz方向保持同胚的逼近，速率为O(n^{-1/d})。在额外光滑性假设下，逼近速率可以做到与维度无关。

Conclusion: 增量生成是基于流生成模型的必要且充分条件，通过组合多个流可以实现对方向保持同胚的通用逼近，这为基于流的生成模型提供了坚实的数学基础。

Abstract: Incremental flow-based denoising models have reshaped generative modelling, but their empirical advantage still lacks a rigorous approximation-theoretic foundation. We show that incremental generation is necessary and sufficient for universal flow-based generation on the largest natural class of self-maps of $[0,1]^d$ compatible with denoising pipelines, namely the orientation-preserving homeomorphisms of $[0,1]^d$. All our guarantees are uniform on the underlying maps and hence imply approximation both samplewise and in distribution.
  Using a new topological-dynamical argument, we first prove an impossibility theorem: the class of all single-step autonomous flows, independently of the architecture, width, depth, or Lipschitz activation of the underlying neural network, is meagre and therefore not universal in the space of orientation-preserving homeomorphisms of $[0,1]^d$. By exploiting algebraic properties of autonomous flows, we conversely show that every orientation-preserving Lipschitz homeomorphism on $[0,1]^d$ can be approximated at rate $\mathcal{O}(n^{-1/d})$ by a composition of at most $K_d$ such flows, where $K_d$ depends only on the dimension. Under additional smoothness assumptions, the approximation rate can be made dimension-free, and $K_d$ can be chosen uniformly over the class being approximated. Finally, by linearly lifting the domain into one higher dimension, we obtain structured universal approximation results for continuous functions and for probability measures on $[0,1]^d$, the latter realized as pushforwards of empirical measures with vanishing $1$-Wasserstein error.

TL;DR: PRISM是一个数据集蒸馏框架，通过使用不同架构的教师模型来分离对数匹配和正则化目标，解决了单教师模型带来的归纳偏差问题，在ImageNet-1K上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集蒸馏方法通常继承单一教师模型的归纳偏差，随着数据集规模增大，这种偏差会导致生成过于平滑、同质化的样本，降低类内多样性并限制泛化能力。

Method: PRISM框架在对数匹配和正则化目标中使用不同架构的教师模型：主模型用于对数匹配，随机子集用于批量归一化对齐，并引入了可扩展的跨类批次形成方案。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K上，PRISM在低中IPC机制下持续优于单教师方法（如SRe2L）和近期多教师变体（如G-VBSM），生成的数据显示出显著更丰富的类内多样性。

Conclusion: PRISM通过解耦架构先验，有效提升了数据集蒸馏的性能和多样性，为大规模数据集蒸馏提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Dataset distillation (DD) promises compact yet faithful synthetic data, but existing approaches often inherit the inductive bias of a single teacher model. As dataset size increases, this bias drives generation toward overly smooth, homogeneous samples, reducing intra-class diversity and limiting generalization. We present PRISM (PRIors from diverse Source Models), a framework that disentangles architectural priors during synthesis. PRISM decouples the logit-matching and regularization objectives, supervising them with different teacher architectures: a primary model for logits and a stochastic subset for batch-normalization (BN) alignment. On ImageNet-1K, PRISM consistently and reproducibly outperforms single-teacher methods (e.g., SRe2L) and recent multi-teacher variants (e.g., G-VBSM) at low- and mid-IPC regimes. The generated data also show significantly richer intra-class diversity, as reflected by a notable drop in cosine similarity between features. We further analyze teacher selection strategies (pre- vs. intra-distillation) and introduce a scalable cross-class batch formation scheme for fast parallel synthesis. Code will be released after the review period.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了M²V-UGAD框架，用于处理图结构数据中节点属性和结构同时缺失的无监督异常检测问题，通过双路径编码器防止跨视图干扰，并利用负采样缓解插补偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中图数据通常存在节点属性和结构信息同时缺失的问题，现有方法假设数据完整，标准插补方案会修复异常节点使其看起来正常，导致检测性能下降。

Method: 使用双路径编码器分别重构缺失的节点属性和图结构，防止错误传播；在联合潜在空间中进行融合和正则化；通过采样潜在空间外的负样本来锐化决策边界。

Result: 在七个公共基准测试中，M²V-UGAD在不同缺失率下始终优于现有的无监督图异常检测方法。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了图数据多重缺失值下的异常检测问题，通过防止跨视图干扰和缓解插补偏差，显著提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised graph anomaly detection (GAD) has received increasing attention in recent years, which aims to identify data anomalous patterns utilizing only unlabeled node information from graph-structured data. However, prevailing unsupervised GAD methods typically presuppose complete node attributes and structure information, a condition hardly satisfied in real-world scenarios owing to privacy, collection errors or dynamic node arrivals. Existing standard imputation schemes risk "repairing" rare anomalous nodes so that they appear normal, thereby introducing imputation bias into the detection process. In addition, when both node attributes and edges are missing simultaneously, estimation errors in one view can contaminate the other, causing cross-view interference that further undermines the detection performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose M$^2$V-UGAD, a multiple missing values-resistant unsupervised GAD framework on incomplete graphs. Specifically, a dual-pathway encoder is first proposed to independently reconstruct missing node attributes and graph structure, thereby preventing errors in one view from propagating to the other. The two pathways are then fused and regularized in a joint latent space so that normals occupy a compact inner manifold while anomalies reside on an outer shell. Lastly, to mitigate imputation bias, we sample latent codes just outside the normal region and decode them into realistic node features and subgraphs, providing hard negative examples that sharpen the decision boundary. Experiments on seven public benchmarks demonstrate that M$^2$V-UGAD consistently outperforms existing unsupervised GAD methods across varying missing rates.

Result: 在一系列机器人操作任务中，TD-ES相比PPO将成功率提高了26.5%，并大幅降低了方差。

Conclusion: TD-ES提供了一种简单、计算量小的可靠微调路径，在保持早期样本效率的同时实现稳健的后期增益。

Abstract: Improving competent robot policies with on-policy RL is often hampered by noisy, low-signal gradients. We revisit Evolution Strategies (ES) as a policy-gradient proxy and localize exploration with bounded, antithetic triangular perturbations, suitable for policy refinement. We propose Triangular-Distribution ES (TD-ES) which pairs bounded triangular noise with a centered-rank finite-difference estimator to deliver stable, parallelizable, gradient-free updates. In a two-stage pipeline -- PPO pretraining followed by TD-ES refinement -- this preserves early sample efficiency while enabling robust late-stage gains. Across a suite of robotic manipulation tasks, TD-ES raises success rates by 26.5% relative to PPO and greatly reduces variance, offering a simple, compute-light path to reliable refinement.

Motivation: 传统MLP方法在时间序列预测中存在季节信号丢失、权重共享MLP的容量限制以及通道独立策略中通道融合不足的问题，需要新的解决方案。

Method: 1) 自适应融合双域季节性MLP，将季节信号分为强弱分量；2) 能量不变注意力机制，自适应关注不同特征通道；3) 动态容量调整机制，根据通道数调整神经元数量。

Result: 在九个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，MDMLP-EIA在预测精度和计算效率方面都达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: MDMLP-EIA通过创新的多域动态MLP架构，有效解决了传统MLP方法的局限性，在时间序列预测任务中实现了优异的性能表现。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is essential across diverse domains. While MLP-based methods have gained attention for achieving Transformer-comparable performance with fewer parameters and better robustness, they face critical limitations including loss of weak seasonal signals, capacity constraints in weight-sharing MLPs, and insufficient channel fusion in channel-independent strategies. To address these challenges, we propose MDMLP-EIA (Multi-domain Dynamic MLPs with Energy Invariant Attention) with three key innovations. First, we develop an adaptive fused dual-domain seasonal MLP that categorizes seasonal signals into strong and weak components. It employs an adaptive zero-initialized channel fusion strategy to minimize noise interference while effectively integrating predictions. Second, we introduce an energy invariant attention mechanism that adaptively focuses on different feature channels within trend and seasonal predictions across time steps. This mechanism maintains constant total signal energy to align with the decomposition-prediction-reconstruction framework and enhance robustness against disturbances. Third, we propose a dynamic capacity adjustment mechanism for channel-independent MLPs. This mechanism scales neuron count with the square root of channel count, ensuring sufficient capacity as channels increase. Extensive experiments across nine benchmark datasets demonstrate that MDMLP-EIA achieves state-of-the-art performance in both prediction accuracy and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Scalable and generalizable analysis of brain activity is essential for advancing both clinical diagnostics and cognitive research. Electroencephalography (EEG), a non-invasive modality with high temporal resolution, has been widely used for brain states analysis. However, most existing EEG models are usually tailored for individual specific tasks, limiting their utility in realistic scenarios where EEG analysis often involves multi-task and continuous reasoning. In this work, we introduce EEGAgent, a general-purpose framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to schedule and plan multiple tools to automatically complete EEG-related tasks. EEGAgent is capable of performing the key functions: EEG basic information perception, spatiotemporal EEG exploration, EEG event detection, interaction with users, and EEG report generation. To realize these capabilities, we design a toolbox composed of different tools for EEG preprocessing, feature extraction, event detection, etc. These capabilities were evaluated on public datasets, and our EEGAgent can support flexible and interpretable EEG analysis, highlighting its potential for real-world clinical applications.

Motivation: 现有漂移检测方法将检测阈值设为固定超参数，但模型性能对此阈值高度敏感。从机器学习角度看，维持模型性能是关键目标，因此研究动态阈值是否能提供更好性能。

Method: 提出动态阈值确定算法，在现有漂移检测框架基础上增加比较阶段来指导阈值调整。证明动态策略（组合各数据段最佳阈值）保证优于任何单一固定阈值。

Abstract: Existing drift detection methods focus on designing sensitive test statistics. They treat the detection threshold as a fixed hyperparameter, set once to balance false alarms and late detections, and applied uniformly across all datasets and over time. However, maintaining model performance is the key objective from the perspective of machine learning, and we observe that model performance is highly sensitive to this threshold. This observation inspires us to investigate whether a dynamic threshold could be provably better. In this paper, we prove that a threshold that adapts over time can outperform any single fixed threshold. The main idea of the proof is that a dynamic strategy, constructed by combining the best threshold from each individual data segment, is guaranteed to outperform any single threshold that apply to all segments. Based on the theorem, we propose a Dynamic Threshold Determination algorithm. It enhances existing drift detection frameworks with a novel comparison phase to inform how the threshold should be adjusted. Extensive experiments on a wide range of synthetic and real-world datasets, including both image and tabular data, validate that our approach substantially enhances the performance of state-of-the-art drift detectors.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of AI-generated content (AIGC) has reshaped the dynamics of digital marketing and online consumer behavior. However, predicting the diffusion trajectory and market impact of such content remains challenging due to data heterogeneity, non linear propagation mechanisms, and evolving consumer interactions. This study proposes an AI driven Decision Support System (DSS) that integrates multi source data including social media streams, marketing expenditure records, consumer engagement logs, and sentiment dynamics using a hybrid Graph Neural Network (GNN) and Temporal Transformer framework. The model jointly learns the content diffusion structure and temporal influence evolution through a dual channel architecture, while causal inference modules disentangle the effects of marketing stimuli on return on investment (ROI) and market visibility. Experiments on large scale real-world datasets collected from multiple online platforms such as Twitter, TikTok, and YouTube advertising show that our system outperforms existing baselines in all six metrics. The proposed DSS enhances marketing decisions by providing interpretable real-time insights into AIGC driven content dissemination and market growth patterns.

Abstract: Tabular data is the most abundant data type in the world, powering systems in finance, healthcare, e-commerce, and beyond. As tabular datasets grow and span multiple related targets, there is an increasing need to exploit shared task information for improved multitask generalization. Multitask learning (MTL) has emerged as a powerful way to improve generalization and efficiency, yet most existing work focuses narrowly on large-scale recommendation systems, leaving its potential in broader tabular domains largely underexplored. Also, existing MTL approaches for tabular data predominantly rely on multi-layer perceptron-based backbones, which struggle to capture complex feature interactions and often fail to scale when data is abundant, a limitation that transformer architectures have overcome in other domains. Motivated by this, we introduce MultiTab-Net, the first multitask transformer architecture specifically designed for large tabular data. MultiTab-Net employs a novel multitask masked-attention mechanism that dynamically models feature-feature dependencies while mitigating task competition. Through extensive experiments, we show that MultiTab-Net consistently achieves higher multitask gain than existing MTL architectures and single-task transformers across diverse domains including large-scale recommendation data, census-like socioeconomic data, and physics datasets, spanning a wide range of task counts, task types, and feature modalities. In addition, we contribute MultiTab-Bench, a generalized multitask synthetic dataset generator that enables systematic evaluation of multitask dynamics by tuning task count, task correlations, and relative task complexity. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Armanfard-Lab/MultiTab.

Abstract: This work explores using the physics-inspired AI Feynman symbolic regression algorithm to automatically rediscover a fundamental equation in astronomy -- the Equation of the Centre. Through the introduction of observational and inductive biases corresponding to the physical nature of the system through data preprocessing and search space restriction, AI Feynman was successful in recovering the first-order analytical form of this equation from lunar ephemerides data. However, this manual approach highlights a key limitation in its reliance on expert-driven coordinate system selection. We therefore propose an automated preprocessing extension to find the canonical coordinate system. Results demonstrate that targeted domain knowledge embedding enables symbolic regression to rediscover physical laws, but also highlight further challenges in constraining symbolic regression to derive physics equations when leveraging domain knowledge through tailored biases.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of machine learning has propelled neural networks to unprecedented success across diverse domains. In particular, multimodal learning has emerged as a transformative paradigm, leveraging complementary information from heterogeneous data streams (e.g., text, vision, audio) to advance contextual reasoning and intelligent decision-making. Despite these advancements, current neural network-based models often fall short in open-world environments characterized by inherent unpredictability, where unpredictable environmental composition dynamics, incomplete modality inputs, and spurious distributions relations critically undermine system reliability. While humans naturally adapt to such dynamic, ambiguous scenarios, artificial intelligence systems exhibit stark limitations in robustness, particularly when processing multimodal signals under real-world complexity. This study investigates the fundamental challenge of multimodal learning robustness in open-world settings, aiming to bridge the gap between controlled experimental performance and practical deployment requirements.

Abstract: We address the general task of learning with a set of candidate models that is too large to have a uniform convergence of empirical estimates to true losses. While the common approach to such challenges is SRM (or regularization) based learning algorithms, we propose a novel learning paradigm that relies on stronger incorporation of empirical data and requires less algorithmic decisions to be based on prior assumptions. We analyze the generalization capabilities of our approach and demonstrate its merits in several common learning assumptions, including similarity of close points, clustering of the domain into highly label-homogeneous regions, Lipschitzness assumptions of the labeling rule, and contrastive learning assumptions. Our approach allows utilizing such assumptions without the need to know their true parameters a priori.

Abstract: The performance of modern DBMSs such as MySQL and PostgreSQL heavily depends on the configuration of performance-critical knobs. Manual tuning these knobs is laborious and inefficient due to the complex and high-dimensional nature of the configuration space. Among the automated tuning methods, reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods have recently sought to improve the DBMS knobs tuning process from several different perspectives. However, they still encounter challenges with slow convergence speed during offline training. In this paper, we mainly focus on how to leverage the valuable tuning hints contained in various textual documents such as DBMS manuals and web forums to improve the offline training of RL-based methods. To this end, we propose an efficient DBMS knobs tuning framework named DemoTuner via a novel LLM-assisted demonstration reinforcement learning method. Specifically, to comprehensively and accurately mine tuning hints from documents, we design a structured chain of thought prompt to employ LLMs to conduct a condition-aware tuning hints extraction task. To effectively integrate the mined tuning hints into RL agent training, we propose a hint-aware demonstration reinforcement learning algorithm HA-DDPGfD in DemoTuner. As far as we know, DemoTuner is the first work to introduce the demonstration reinforcement learning algorithm for DBMS knobs tuning. Experimental evaluations conducted on MySQL and PostgreSQL across various workloads demonstrate the significant advantages of DemoTuner in both performance improvement and online tuning cost reduction over three representative baselines including DB-BERT, GPTuner and CDBTune. Additionally, DemoTuner also exhibits superior adaptability to application scenarios with unknown workloads.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种量子启发的交互作用建模方法，通过相干聚合（复数振幅求和后平方）与不相干聚合（平方幅度求和）的对比，实现了对协同与拮抗作用的机制级控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将交互作用视为工程化的乘积项或灵活模型中的涌现模式，缺乏对协同与拮抗作用的控制机制。

Method: 提出了干涉核分类器（IKC），采用相干聚合方法，并引入了相干增益和干涉信息两个诊断指标。

Result: 在高交互合成任务（XOR）上IKC优于强基线；在真实表格数据上整体有竞争力；切换聚合方式能一致改善负对数似然、Brier分数和期望校准误差。

Conclusion: 量子启发的相干聚合方法为交互作用建模提供了机制级控制，相干增益在真实数据集上表现积极。

Abstract: Classical approaches often treat interaction as engineered product terms or as emergent patterns in flexible models, offering little control over how synergy or antagonism arises. We take a quantum-inspired view: following the Born rule (probability as squared amplitude), \emph{coherent} aggregation sums complex amplitudes before squaring, creating an interference cross-term, whereas an \emph{incoherent} proxy sums squared magnitudes and removes it. In a minimal linear-amplitude model, this cross-term equals the standard potential-outcome interaction contrast \(Δ_{\mathrm{INT}}\) in a \(2\times 2\) factorial design, giving relative phase a direct, mechanism-level control over synergy versus antagonism.
  We instantiate this idea in a lightweight \emph{Interference Kernel Classifier} (IKC) and introduce two diagnostics: \emph{Coherent Gain} (log-likelihood gain of coherent over the incoherent proxy) and \emph{Interference Information} (the induced Kullback-Leibler gap). A controlled phase sweep recovers the identity. On a high-interaction synthetic task (XOR), IKC outperforms strong baselines under paired, budget-matched comparisons; on real tabular data (\emph{Adult} and \emph{Bank Marketing}) it is competitive overall but typically trails the most capacity-rich baseline in paired differences.

TL;DR: 提出了GraphSB框架，通过结构平衡策略解决图神经网络中不平衡节点分类的结构不平衡问题，包含结构增强和关系扩散两个阶段，可提升现有方法性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有不平衡节点分类方法主要关注数据层面（合成少数类节点）或算法层面（优化学习过程），但都忽略了图结构本身的不平衡性，这是导致多数类主导和少数类同化的根本原因。

Method: GraphSB框架引入结构平衡策略，包含：1) 结构增强 - 自适应构建基于相似性的边来加强少数类节点连通性；2) 关系扩散 - 捕获高阶依赖关系同时放大少数类信号。在节点合成前先平衡结构分布。

Result: 大量实验表明GraphSB显著优于现有最先进方法，且结构平衡模块可作为即插即用组件集成到现有方法中，平均提升准确率3.67%。

Conclusion: 图结构不平衡是影响不平衡节点分类性能的关键因素，GraphSB通过结构平衡策略有效解决了这一问题，为图神经网络在不平衡场景下的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Imbalanced node classification is a critical challenge in graph learning, where most existing methods typically utilize Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn node representations. These methods can be broadly categorized into the data-level and the algorithm-level. The former aims to synthesize minority-class nodes to mitigate quantity imbalance, while the latter tries to optimize the learning process to highlight minority classes. However, neither category addresses the inherently imbalanced graph structure, which is a fundamental factor that incurs majority-class dominance and minority-class assimilation in GNNs. Our theoretical analysis further supports this critical insight. Therefore, we propose GraphSB (Graph Structural Balance), a novel framework that incorporates Structural Balance as a key strategy to address the underlying imbalanced graph structure before node synthesis. Structural Balance performs a two-stage structure optimization: Structure Enhancement that adaptively builds similarity-based edges to strengthen connectivity of minority-class nodes, and Relation Diffusion that captures higher-order dependencies while amplifying signals from minority classes. Thus, GraphSB balances structural distribution before node synthesis, enabling more effective learning in GNNs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GraphSB significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. More importantly, the proposed Structural Balance can be seamlessly integrated into state-of-the-art methods as a simple plug-and-play module, increasing their accuracy by an average of 3.67\%.

Conclusion: SVD-NO通过近似完整核获得高表达能力，同时由于低秩结构保持合理的计算复杂度，是一个实用的系统。

Abstract: Neural operators have emerged as a promising paradigm for learning solution operators of partial differential equa- tions (PDEs) directly from data. Existing methods, such as those based on Fourier or graph techniques, make strong as- sumptions about the structure of the kernel integral opera- tor, assumptions which may limit expressivity. We present SVD-NO, a neural operator that explicitly parameterizes the kernel by its singular-value decomposition (SVD) and then carries out the integral directly in the low-rank basis. Two lightweight networks learn the left and right singular func- tions, a diagonal parameter matrix learns the singular values, and a Gram-matrix regularizer enforces orthonormality. As SVD-NO approximates the full kernel, it obtains a high de- gree of expressivity. Furthermore, due to its low-rank struc- ture the computational complexity of applying the operator remains reasonable, leading to a practical system. In exten- sive evaluations on five diverse benchmark equations, SVD- NO achieves a new state of the art. In particular, SVD-NO provides greater performance gains on PDEs whose solutions are highly spatially variable. The code of this work is publicly available at https://github.com/2noamk/SVDNO.git.

Abstract: Inferring causal relationships from observed data is an important task, yet it becomes challenging when the data is subject to various external interferences. Most of these interferences are the additional effects of external factors on observed variables. Since these external factors are often unknown, we introduce latent variables to represent these unobserved factors that affect the observed data. Specifically, to capture the causal strength and adjacency information, we propose a new temporal latent variable structural causal model, incorporating causal strength and adjacency coefficients that represent the causal relationships between variables. Considering that expert knowledge can provide information about unknown interferences in certain scenarios, we develop a method that facilitates the incorporation of prior knowledge into parameter learning based on Variational Inference, to guide the model estimation. Experimental results demonstrate the stability and accuracy of our proposed method.

TL;DR: MoE模型通过仅激活部分专家网络来减少计算量，但全参数集超出GPU内存容量。现有系统将非活跃专家卸载到CPU内存，但PCIe传输延迟显著。预取启发式方法旨在隐藏延迟，但预取失败会导致显著停顿或精度下降。

Motivation: 解决MoE模型在预取失败时既要保持高推理速度又要维持模型精度的关键挑战。

Method: 通过将非活跃专家卸载到CPU内存并使用预取启发式方法来预测所需专家，但面临预取失败的问题。

Result: 预取失败时，现有方法要么导致PCIe传输延迟造成的长停顿，要么通过丢弃专家计算而显著降低模型精度。

Conclusion: 需要在预取失败时开发既能保持高推理速度又能维持模型精度的解决方案。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures scale language models by activating only a subset of specialized expert networks for each input token, thereby reducing the number of floating-point operations. However, the growing size of modern MoE models causes their full parameter sets to exceed GPU memory capacity; for example, Mixtral-8x7B has 45 billion parameters and requires 87 GB of memory even though only 14 billion parameters are used per token. Existing systems alleviate this limitation by offloading inactive experts to CPU memory, but transferring experts across the PCIe interconnect incurs significant latency (about 10 ms). Prefetching heuristics aim to hide this latency by predicting which experts are needed, but prefetch failures introduce significant stalls and amplify inference latency. In the event of a prefetch failure, prior work offers two primary solutions: either fetch the expert on demand, which incurs a long stall due to the PCIe bottleneck, or drop the expert from the computation, which significantly degrades model accuracy. The critical challenge, therefore, is to maintain both high inference speed and model accuracy when prefetching fails.

Conclusion: 该研究提供了对离散蛋白质结构表示本质的基本见解，并引入了一种强大、近乎瞬时的方法来建模蛋白质动态性。

Abstract: Protein structure tokenization converts 3D structures into discrete or vectorized representations, enabling the integration of structural and sequence data. Despite many recent works on structure tokenization, the properties of the underlying discrete representations are not well understood. In this work, we first demonstrate that the successful utilization of structural tokens in a language model for structure prediction depends on using rich, pre-trained sequence embeddings to bridge the semantic gap between the sequence and structural "language". The analysis of the structural vocabulary itself then reveals significant semantic redundancy, where multiple distinct tokens correspond to nearly identical local geometries, acting as "structural synonyms". This redundancy, rather than being a flaw, can be exploited with a simple "synonym swap" strategy to generate diverse conformational ensembles by perturbing a predicted structure with its structural synonyms. This computationally lightweight method accurately recapitulates protein flexibility, performing competitively with state-of-the-art models. Our study provides fundamental insights into the nature of discrete protein structure representations and introduces a powerful, near-instantaneous method for modeling protein dynamics.

TL;DR: FAQNAS是一个面向混合量子神经网络(HQNNs)的FLOPs感知神经架构搜索框架，将HQNN设计建模为平衡精度和FLOPs的多目标优化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在NISQ时代，虽然量子电路不直接使用FLOPs度量，但HQNNs主要在经典模拟器上训练，FLOPs直接影响运行时间和可扩展性，因此需要将FLOPs作为HQNN计算复杂度的实用度量标准。

Method: 提出FAQNAS框架，将FLOPs明确纳入优化目标，通过多目标优化平衡精度和计算成本，发现高性能且计算效率高的架构。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上的实验表明，量子FLOPs主导精度提升，而经典FLOPs基本保持不变。帕累托最优解显示相比不考虑FLOPs的基线，能以显著降低的计算成本达到竞争性精度。

Conclusion: FLOPs感知性是NISQ时代HQNN设计的实用标准，也是未来HQNN系统的可扩展原则。

Abstract: Hybrid Quantum Neural Networks (HQNNs), which combine parameterized quantum circuits with classical neural layers, are emerging as promising models in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era. While quantum circuits are not naturally measured in floating point operations (FLOPs), most HQNNs (in NISQ era) are still trained on classical simulators where FLOPs directly dictate runtime and scalability. Hence, FLOPs represent a practical and viable metric to measure the computational complexity of HQNNs. In this work, we introduce FAQNAS, a FLOPs-aware neural architecture search (NAS) framework that formulates HQNN design as a multi-objective optimization problem balancing accuracy and FLOPs. Unlike traditional approaches, FAQNAS explicitly incorporates FLOPs into the optimization objective, enabling the discovery of architectures that achieve strong performance while minimizing computational cost. Experiments on five benchmark datasets (MNIST, Digits, Wine, Breast Cancer, and Iris) show that quantum FLOPs dominate accuracy improvements, while classical FLOPs remain largely fixed. Pareto-optimal solutions reveal that competitive accuracy can often be achieved with significantly reduced computational cost compared to FLOPs-agnostic baselines. Our results establish FLOPs-awareness as a practical criterion for HQNN design in the NISQ era and as a scalable principle for future HQNN systems.

Motivation: 大规模城市网络安全博弈（UNSGs）由于巨大的组合动作空间，难以有效计算纳什均衡。现有方法如PSRO需要计算最佳响应，但在大规模游戏中精确计算不切实际，而使用强化学习近似又会引入误差。

Method: TSO框架采用树结构表示整个动作空间，将这种表示整合到损失函数中并理论证明其等价性，同时引入采样剪枝机制避免陷入局部最优解。

Result: 大量实验结果表明TSO在解决UNSGs问题上优于其他基线算法。

Conclusion: TSO成功弥合了随机优化范式与UNSGs需求之间的差距，为大规模博弈中的纳什均衡计算提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Urban Network Security Games (UNSGs), which model the strategic allocation of limited security resources on city road networks, are critical for urban safety. However, finding a Nash Equilibrium (NE) in large-scale UNSGs is challenging due to their massive and combinatorial action spaces. One common approach to addressing these games is the Policy-Space Response Oracle (PSRO) framework, which requires computing best responses (BR) at each iteration. However, precisely computing exact BRs is impractical in large-scale games, and employing reinforcement learning to approximate BRs inevitably introduces errors, which limits the overall effectiveness of the PSRO methods. Recent advancements in leveraging non-convex stochastic optimization to approximate an NE offer a promising alternative to the burdensome BR computation. However, utilizing existing stochastic optimization techniques with an unbiased loss function for UNSGs remains challenging because the action spaces are too vast to be effectively represented by neural networks. To address these issues, we introduce Tree-based Stochastic Optimization (TSO), a framework that bridges the gap between the stochastic optimization paradigm for NE-finding and the demands of UNSGs. Specifically, we employ the tree-based action representation that maps the whole action space onto a tree structure, addressing the challenge faced by neural networks in representing actions when the action space cannot be enumerated. We then incorporate this representation into the loss function and theoretically demonstrate its equivalence to the unbiased loss function. To further enhance the quality of the converged solution, we introduce a sample-and-prune mechanism that reduces the risk of being trapped in suboptimal local optima. Extensive experimental results indicate the superiority of TSO over other baseline algorithms in addressing the UNSGs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前后验可解释性方法存在安全漏洞，攻击者可以在不访问模型内部的情况下仅通过预测和解释结果就操纵解释输出，这在安全关键应用中构成严重威胁。

Method: 开发了单步黑盒攻击方法，仅需模型的预测和解释结果，无需访问模型权重或内部结构，针对saliency maps、integrated gradients和DeepLIFT SHAP等解释方法生成对抗样本。

Result: 攻击成功显著改变了ResNet-18和ViT-B16在ImageNet上的解释结果，同时保持预测概率不变，原始图像与篡改图像的结构相似性指数(SSIM)保持较高。

Conclusion: 该方法暴露了当前可解释性方法的严重脆弱性，对其在安全关键应用中的可靠性提出了质疑。

Abstract: Post-hoc explainability methods are a subset of Machine Learning (ML) that aim to provide a reason for why a model behaves in a certain way. In this paper, we show a new black-box model-agnostic adversarial attack for post-hoc explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), particularly in the image domain. The goal of the attack is to modify the original explanations while being undetected by the human eye and maintain the same predicted class. In contrast to previous methods, we do not require any access to the model or its weights, but only to the model's computed predictions and explanations. Additionally, the attack is accomplished in a single step while significantly changing the provided explanations, as demonstrated by empirical evaluation. The low requirements of our method expose a critical vulnerability in current explainability methods, raising concerns about their reliability in safety-critical applications. We systematically generate attacks based on the explanations generated by post-hoc explainability methods (saliency maps, integrated gradients, and DeepLIFT SHAP) for pretrained ResNet-18 and ViT-B16 on ImageNet. The results show that our attacks could lead to dramatically different explanations without changing the predictive probabilities. We validate the effectiveness of our attack, compute the induced change based on the explanation with mean absolute difference, and verify the closeness of the original image and the corrupted one with the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM).

Motivation: 文本到图像生成模型在现实应用中的战略部署引发了负责任AI管理的担忧，特别是关于种族和性别相关刻板印象的复制和放大问题。

Method: 对五个最流行的开源模型进行实证研究，使用十个中性职业相关提示生成每个职业100张图像，共5000张图像由代表不同种族和性别的多样化人类评估者评估。

Conclusion: 这些结果为AI项目经理和从业者提供了关键见解，使他们能够选择公平的AI模型和定制提示，生成符合负责任AI原则的图像。讨论了这些偏见的风险，并提出了在构建负责任生成式AI系统中减轻偏见的可行策略。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generative models are largely used in AI-powered real-world applications and value creation. However, their strategic deployment raises critical concerns for responsible AI management, particularly regarding the reproduction and amplification of race- and gender-related stereotypes that can undermine organizational ethics. In this work, we investigate whether such societal biases are systematically encoded within the pretrained latent spaces of state-of-the-art T2I models. We conduct an empirical study across the five most popular open-source models, using ten neutral, profession-related prompts to generate 100 images per profession, resulting in a dataset of 5,000 images evaluated by diverse human assessors representing different races and genders. We demonstrate that all five models encode and amplify pronounced societal skew: caregiving and nursing roles are consistently feminized, while high-status professions such as corporate CEO, politician, doctor, and lawyer are overwhelmingly represented by males and mostly White individuals. We further identify model-specific patterns, such as QWEN-Image's near-exclusive focus on East Asian outputs, Kandinsky's dominance of White individuals, and SDXL's comparatively broader but still biased distributions. These results provide critical insights for AI project managers and practitioners, enabling them to select equitable AI models and customized prompts that generate images in alignment with the principles of responsible AI. We conclude by discussing the risks of these biases and proposing actionable strategies for bias mitigation in building responsible GenAI systems.

Abstract: Although recent generative models are remarkably capable of producing instruction-following and realistic outputs, they remain prone to notable physical plausibility failures. Though critical in applications, these physical plausibility errors often escape detection by existing evaluation methods. Furthermore, no framework exists for automatically identifying and interpreting specific physical error patterns in natural language, preventing targeted model improvements. We introduce Matryoshka Transcoders, a novel framework for the automatic discovery and interpretation of physical plausibility features in generative models. Our approach extends the Matryoshka representation learning paradigm to transcoder architectures, enabling hierarchical sparse feature learning at multiple granularity levels. By training on intermediate representations from a physical plausibility classifier and leveraging large multimodal models for interpretation, our method identifies diverse physics-related failure modes without manual feature engineering, achieving superior feature relevance and feature accuracy compared to existing approaches. We utilize the discovered visual patterns to establish a benchmark for evaluating physical plausibility in generative models. Our analysis of eight state-of-the-art generative models provides valuable insights into how these models fail to follow physical constraints, paving the way for further model improvements.

Motivation: 传统时间序列预测方法使用MSE损失存在两个根本弱点：逐点误差计算无法捕捉时间关系，且未考虑数据中的固有噪声。

Method: 引入基于HSIC的残差感知损失函数，通过强制残差序列与随机时间序列之间的依赖性来显式建模噪声结构。

Result: 在8个真实世界基准测试和5个领先预测模型上的实验表明预测性能得到改善，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: RI-Loss通过显式建模噪声结构提供了更鲁棒、噪声感知的表示，在理论上提供了严格的优化保证，在实践中显著提升了预测性能。

Abstract: Time series forecasting relies on predicting future values from historical data, yet most state-of-the-art approaches-including transformer and multilayer perceptron-based models-optimize using Mean Squared Error (MSE), which has two fundamental weaknesses: its point-wise error computation fails to capture temporal relationships, and it does not account for inherent noise in the data. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Residual-Informed Loss (RI-Loss), a novel objective function based on the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC). RI-Loss explicitly models noise structure by enforcing dependence between the residual sequence and a random time series, enabling more robust, noise-aware representations. Theoretically, we derive the first non-asymptotic HSIC bound with explicit double-sample complexity terms, achieving optimal convergence rates through Bernstein-type concentration inequalities and Rademacher complexity analysis. This provides rigorous guarantees for RI-Loss optimization while precisely quantifying kernel space interactions. Empirically, experiments across eight real-world benchmarks and five leading forecasting models demonstrate improvements in predictive performance, validating the effectiveness of our approach. Code will be made publicly available to ensure reproducibility.

Abstract: Accurate exploration of protein conformational ensembles is essential for uncovering function but remains hard because molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations suffer from high computational costs and energy-barrier trapping. This paper presents Energy Preference Optimization (EPO), an online refinement algorithm that turns a pretrained protein ensemble generator into an energy-aware sampler without extra MD trajectories. Specifically, EPO leverages stochastic differential equation sampling to explore the conformational landscape and incorporates a novel energy-ranking mechanism based on list-wise preference optimization. Crucially, EPO introduces a practical upper bound to efficiently approximate the intractable probability of long sampling trajectories in continuous-time generative models, making it easily adaptable to existing pretrained generators. On Tetrapeptides, ATLAS, and Fast-Folding benchmarks, EPO successfully generates diverse and physically realistic ensembles, establishing a new state-of-the-art in nine evaluation metrics. These results demonstrate that energy-only preference signals can efficiently steer generative models toward thermodynamically consistent conformational ensembles, providing an alternative to long MD simulations and widening the applicability of learned potentials in structural biology and drug discovery.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with limited samples is common in real-world applications. However, offline RL performance under this constraint is often suboptimal. We consider an alternative approach to dealing with limited samples by introducing the Quantum Metric Encoder (QME). In this methodology, instead of applying the RL framework directly on the original states and rewards, we embed the states into a more compact and meaningful representation, where the structure of the encoding is inspired by quantum circuits. For classical data, QME is a classically simulable, trainable unitary embedding and thus serves as a quantum-inspired module, on a classical device. For quantum data in the form of quantum states, QME can be implemented directly on quantum hardware, allowing for training without measurement or re-encoding.
  We evaluated QME on three datasets, each limited to 100 samples. We use Soft-Actor-Critic (SAC) and Implicit-Q-Learning (IQL), two well-known RL algorithms, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. From the experimental results, we find that training offline RL agents on QME-embedded states with decoded rewards yields significantly better performance than training on the original states and rewards. On average across the three datasets, for maximum reward performance, we achieve a 116.2% improvement for SAC and 117.6% for IQL.
  We further investigate the $Δ$-hyperbolicity of our framework, a geometric property of the state space known to be important for the RL training efficacy. The QME-embedded states exhibit low $Δ$-hyperbolicity, suggesting that the improvement after embedding arises from the modified geometry of the state space induced by QME. Thus, the low $Δ$-hyperbolicity and the corresponding effectiveness of QME could provide valuable information for developing efficient offline RL methods under limited-sample conditions.

Abstract: Animal vocalizations contain sequential structures that carry important communicative information, yet most computational bioacoustics studies average the extracted frame-level features across the temporal axis, discarding the order of the sub-units within a vocalization. This paper investigates whether discrete acoustic token sequences, derived through vector quantization and gumbel-softmax vector quantization of extracted self-supervised speech model representations can effectively capture and leverage temporal information. To that end, pairwise distance analysis of token sequences generated from HuBERT embeddings shows that they can discriminate call-types and callers across four bioacoustics datasets. Sequence classification experiments using $k$-Nearest Neighbour with Levenshtein distance show that the vector-quantized token sequences yield reasonable call-type and caller classification performances, and hold promise as alternative feature representations towards leveraging sequential information in animal vocalizations.

*Jieting Wang,Huimei Shi,Feijiang Li,Xiaolei Shang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OCE-TS是一种新颖的时间序列预测方法，使用序数交叉熵损失替代传统的均方误差损失，通过概率输出量化不确定性并保持预测值的顺序关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于深度学习的时间序列预测模型主要使用均方误差损失函数，这种方法无法提供不确定性估计且对异常值鲁棒性差。

Method: 将观测值离散化为有序区间，通过参数分布推导概率作为监督信号，使用线性模型预测每个时间步的概率分布，计算预测与真实累积分布之间的序数交叉熵损失。

Result: 在7个公共时间序列数据集上与5个基准模型比较，使用MSE和MAE作为评估指标，OCE-TS始终优于基准模型。

Conclusion: OCE-TS通过序数分类方法有效解决了传统回归模型在不确定性估计和异常值鲁棒性方面的局限性，在时间序列预测任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is an important task that involves analyzing temporal dependencies and underlying patterns (such as trends, cyclicality, and seasonality) in historical data to predict future values or trends. Current deep learning-based forecasting models primarily employ Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss functions for regression modeling. Despite enabling direct value prediction, this method offers no uncertainty estimation and exhibits poor outlier robustness. To address these limitations, we propose OCE-TS, a novel ordinal classification approach for time series forecasting that replaces MSE with Ordinal Cross-Entropy (OCE) loss, preserving prediction order while quantifying uncertainty through probability output. Specifically, OCE-TS begins by discretizing observed values into ordered intervals and deriving their probabilities via a parametric distribution as supervision signals. Using a simple linear model, we then predict probability distributions for each timestep. The OCE loss is computed between the cumulative distributions of predicted and ground-truth probabilities, explicitly preserving ordinal relationships among forecasted values. Through theoretical analysis using influence functions, we establish that cross-entropy (CE) loss exhibits superior stability and outlier robustness compared to MSE loss. Empirically, we compared OCE-TS with five baseline models-Autoformer, DLinear, iTransformer, TimeXer, and TimeBridge-on seven public time series datasets. Using MSE and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as evaluation metrics, the results demonstrate that OCE-TS consistently outperforms benchmark models. The code will be published.

Abstract: Attention mechanisms underpin the computational power of Transformer models, which have achieved remarkable success across diverse domains. Yet understanding and extending the principles underlying self-attention remains a key challenge for advancing artificial intelligence. Drawing inspiration from the multiscale dynamics of biological attention and from dynamical systems theory, we introduce Fractional Neural Attention (FNA), a principled, neuroscience-inspired framework for multiscale information processing. FNA models token interactions through Lévy diffusion governed by the fractional Laplacian, intrinsically realizing simultaneous short- and long-range dependencies across multiple scales. This mechanism yields greater expressivity and faster information mixing, advancing the foundational capacity of Transformers. Theoretically, we show that FNA's dynamics are governed by the fractional diffusion equation, and that the resulting attention networks exhibit larger spectral gaps and shorter path lengths -- mechanistic signatures of enhanced computational efficiency. Empirically, FNA achieves competitive text-classification performance even with a single layer and a single head; it also improves performance in image processing and neural machine translation. Finally, the diffusion map algorithm from geometric harmonics enables dimensionality reduction of FNA weights while preserving the intrinsic structure of embeddings and hidden states. Together, these results establish FNA as a principled mechanism connecting self-attention, stochastic dynamics, and geometry, providing an interpretable, biologically grounded foundation for powerful, neuroscience-inspired AI.

Conclusion: VDT方法通过领域不变特征学习和测试时训练机制，有效提升了OOC虚假信息检测的领域适应能力。

Abstract: Out-of-context misinformation (OOC) is a low-cost form of misinformation in news reports, which refers to place authentic images into out-of-context or fabricated image-text pairings. This problem has attracted significant attention from researchers in recent years. Current methods focus on assessing image-text consistency or generating explanations. However, these approaches assume that the training and test data are drawn from the same distribution. When encountering novel news domains, models tend to perform poorly due to the lack of prior knowledge. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{VDT} to enhance the domain adaptation capability for OOC misinformation detection by learning domain-invariant features and test-time training mechanisms. Domain-Invariant Variational Align module is employed to jointly encodes source and target domain data to learn a separable distributional space domain-invariant features. For preserving semantic integrity, we utilize domain consistency constraint module to reconstruct the source and target domain latent distribution. During testing phase, we adopt the test-time training strategy and confidence-variance filtering module to dynamically updating the VAE encoder and classifier, facilitating the model's adaptation to the target domain distribution. Extensive experiments conducted on the benchmark dataset NewsCLIPpings demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under most domain adaptation settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedCure是一个创新的半异步联邦学习框架，通过联盟构建和参与感知调度来解决非IID数据下的参与偏差问题，在四个真实数据集上相比基线方法精度提升高达5.1倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 半异步联邦学习(SAFL)虽然结合了同步训练效率和异步更新灵活性，但存在参与偏差问题，且非IID数据分布会加剧这一问题。分层架构将参与从单个客户端转移到客户端组，进一步强化了这个问题。现有研究大多关注传统云-端架构，忽略了非IID数据在云-边-客户端层次结构中对调度的关键影响。

Method: FedCure通过三个关键规则运作：(1)偏好规则：通过最大化集体利益和建立理论稳定的分区来优化联盟形成，减少非IID引起的性能下降；(2)调度规则：将虚拟队列技术与贝叶斯估计的联盟动态相结合，在确保平均速率稳定的同时减轻效率损失；(3)资源分配规则：基于估计的联盟动态优化客户端CPU频率，在满足延迟要求的同时提高计算效率。

Result: 在四个真实数据集上的综合实验表明，FedCure相比四个最先进的基线方法，精度提升高达5.1倍，同时显著提高了效率，每轮延迟的变异系数最低为0.0223，并在各种场景下保持长期平衡。

Conclusion: FedCure通过联盟构建和参与感知调度有效缓解了非IID数据下的参与偏差问题，在精度和效率方面都显著优于现有方法，为分层联邦学习架构提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: While semi-asynchronous federated learning (SAFL) combines the efficiency of synchronous training with the flexibility of asynchronous updates, it inherently suffers from participation bias, which is further exacerbated by non-IID data distributions. More importantly, hierarchical architecture shifts participation from individual clients to client groups, thereby further intensifying this issue. Despite notable advancements in SAFL research, most existing works still focus on conventional cloud-end architectures while largely overlooking the critical impact of non-IID data on scheduling across the cloud-edge-client hierarchy. To tackle these challenges, we propose FedCure, an innovative semi-asynchronous Federated learning framework that leverages coalition construction and participation-aware scheduling to mitigate participation bias with non-IID data. Specifically, FedCure operates through three key rules: (1) a preference rule that optimizes coalition formation by maximizing collective benefits and establishing theoretically stable partitions to reduce non-IID-induced performance degradation; (2) a scheduling rule that integrates the virtual queue technique with Bayesian-estimated coalition dynamics, mitigating efficiency loss while ensuring mean rate stability; and (3) a resource allocation rule that enhances computational efficiency by optimizing client CPU frequencies based on estimated coalition dynamics while satisfying delay requirements. Comprehensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that FedCure improves accuracy by up to 5.1x compared with four state-of-the-art baselines, while significantly enhancing efficiency with the lowest coefficient of variation 0.0223 for per-round latency and maintaining long-term balance across diverse scenarios.

Motivation: 分析LLM图推理器对图序列化变化的敏感性，研究微调如何影响编码敏感性和在未见任务上的泛化能力。

Method: 将图序列化分解为节点标记、边编码和语法三个因素，在综合基准套件上评估LLM对每个因素变化的鲁棒性，并贡献一组谱任务来评估微调推理器的泛化能力。

Result: 较大（未微调）模型更鲁棒。微调降低了节点重新标记的敏感性，但可能增加对结构和格式变化的敏感性，且不能持续提高在未见任务上的性能。

Conclusion: LLM图推理器存在鲁棒性问题，微调对敏感性的影响复杂，不能保证在未见任务上的泛化改进。

Abstract: While promising, graph reasoners based on Large Language Models (LLMs) lack built-in invariance to symmetries in graph representations. Operating on sequential graph serializations, LLMs can produce different outputs under node reindexing, edge reordering, or formatting changes, raising robustness concerns. We systematically analyze these effects, studying how fine-tuning impacts encoding sensitivity as well generalization on unseen tasks. We propose a principled decomposition of graph serializations into node labeling, edge encoding, and syntax, and evaluate LLM robustness to variations of each of these factors on a comprehensive benchmarking suite. We also contribute a novel set of spectral tasks to further assess generalization abilities of fine-tuned reasoners. Results show that larger (non-fine-tuned) models are more robust. Fine-tuning reduces sensitivity to node relabeling but may increase it to variations in structure and format, while it does not consistently improve performance on unseen tasks.

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated exceptional in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, enabling applications across natural language processing, computer vision, and sequential decision-making. In reinforcement learning, ICL reframes learning as a supervised problem, facilitating task adaptation without parameter updates. Building on prior work leveraging transformers for sequential decision-making, we propose Heuristic Transformer (HT), an in-context reinforcement learning (ICRL) approach that augments the in-context dataset with a belief distribution over rewards to achieve better decision-making. Using a variational auto-encoder (VAE), a low-dimensional stochastic variable is learned to represent the posterior distribution over rewards, which is incorporated alongside an in-context dataset and query states as prompt to the transformer policy. We assess the performance of HT across the Darkroom, Miniworld, and MuJoCo environments, showing that it consistently surpasses comparable baselines in terms of both effectiveness and generalization. Our method presents a promising direction to bridge the gap between belief-based augmentations and transformer-based decision-making.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various domains, including computer vision and natural language processing. However, they often struggle to accurately quantify the uncertainty of their predictions, limiting their broader adoption in critical real-world applications. Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) for Deep Learning seeks to address this challenge by providing methods to improve the reliability of uncertainty estimates.

Conclusion: 多模态大语言模型中存在持续的安全脆弱性，迫切需要强大的安全防护措施。

Abstract: Since Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly being integrated into everyday tools and intelligent agents, growing concerns have arisen regarding their possible output of unsafe contents, ranging from toxic language and biased imagery to privacy violations and harmful misinformation. Current safety benchmarks remain highly limited in both modality coverage and performance evaluations, often neglecting the extensive landscape of content safety. In this work, we introduce OutSafe-Bench, the first most comprehensive content safety evaluation test suite designed for the multimodal era. OutSafe-Bench includes a large-scale dataset that spans four modalities, featuring over 18,000 bilingual (Chinese and English) text prompts, 4,500 images, 450 audio clips and 450 videos, all systematically annotated across nine critical content risk categories. In addition to the dataset, we introduce a Multidimensional Cross Risk Score (MCRS), a novel metric designed to model and assess overlapping and correlated content risks across different categories. To ensure fair and robust evaluation, we propose FairScore, an explainable automated multi-reviewer weighted aggregation framework. FairScore selects top-performing models as adaptive juries, thereby mitigating biases from single-model judgments and enhancing overall evaluation reliability. Our evaluation of nine state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals persistent and substantial safety vulnerabilities, underscoring the pressing need for robust safeguards in MLLMs.

Conclusion: PITE通过细粒度的原型级对齐减少分布偏移，同时保持治疗组和对照组的局部结构，为个体治疗效果估计提供了有意义的约束

Abstract: Estimating Individual Treatment Effects (ITE) from observational data is challenging due to confounding bias. Most studies tackle this bias by balancing distributions globally, but ignore individual heterogeneity and fail to capture the local structure that represents the natural clustering among individuals, which ultimately compromises ITE estimation. While instance-level alignment methods consider heterogeneity, they similarly overlook the local structure information. To address these issues, we propose an end-to-end Multi-\textbf{P}rototype alignment method for \textbf{ITE} estimation (\textbf{PITE}). PITE effectively captures local structure within groups and enforces cross-group alignment, thereby achieving robust ITE estimation. Specifically, we first define prototypes as cluster centroids based on similar individuals under the same treatment. To identify local similarity and the distribution consistency, we perform instance-to-prototype matching to assign individuals to the nearest prototype within groups, and design a multi-prototype alignment strategy to encourage the matched prototypes to be close across treatment arms in the latent space. PITE not only reduces distribution shift through fine-grained, prototype-level alignment, but also preserves the local structures of treated and control groups, which provides meaningful constraints for ITE estimation. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that PITE outperforms 13 state-of-the-art methods, achieving more accurate and robust ITE estimation.

Conclusion: EDGC通过动态梯度压缩有效解决了大语言模型训练中的通信瓶颈问题，在保证模型性能的同时显著提升了训练效率。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) poses significant challenges regarding computational resources and memory capacity. Although distributed training techniques help mitigate these issues, they still suffer from considerable communication overhead. Existing approaches primarily rely on static gradient compression to enhance communication efficiency; however, these methods neglect the dynamic nature of evolving gradients during training, leading to performance degradation. Accelerating LLM training via compression without sacrificing performance remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose an entropy-driven dynamic gradient compression framework called EDGC. The core concept is to adjust the compression rate during LLM training based on the evolving trends of gradient entropy, taking into account both compression efficiency and error. EDGC consists of three key components.First, it employs a down-sampling method to efficiently estimate gradient entropy, reducing computation overhead. Second, it establishes a theoretical model linking compression rate with gradient entropy, enabling more informed compression decisions. Lastly, a window-based adjustment mechanism dynamically adapts the compression rate across pipeline stages, improving communication efficiency and maintaining model performance. We implemented EDGC on a 32-NVIDIA-V100 cluster and a 64-NVIDIA-H100 cluster to train GPT2-2.5B and GPT2-12.1B, respectively. The results show that EDGC significantly reduces communication latency and training time by up to 46.45% and 16.13% while preserving LLM accuracy.

Abstract: Decentralized cooperative multi-agent multi-armed bandits (DeCMA2B) considers how multiple agents collaborate in a decentralized multi-armed bandit setting. Though this problem has been extensively studied in previous work, most existing methods remain susceptible to various adversarial attacks. In this paper, we first study DeCMA2B with adversarial corruption, where an adversary can corrupt reward observations of all agents with a limited corruption budget. We propose a robust algorithm, called DeMABAR, which ensures that each agent's individual regret suffers only an additive term proportional to the corruption budget. Then we consider a more realistic scenario where the adversary can only attack a small number of agents. Our theoretical analysis shows that the DeMABAR algorithm can also almost completely eliminate the influence of adversarial attacks and is inherently robust in the Byzantine setting, where an unknown fraction of the agents can be Byzantine, i.e., may arbitrarily select arms and communicate wrong information. We also conduct numerical experiments to illustrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: The paper surveys recent progresses in understanding the dynamics and loss landscape of the gradient flow equations associated to deep linear neural networks, i.e., the gradient descent training dynamics (in the limit when the step size goes to 0) of deep neural networks missing the activation functions and subject to quadratic loss functions. When formulated in terms of the adjacency matrix of the neural network, as we do in the paper, these gradient flow equations form a class of converging matrix ODEs which is nilpotent, polynomial, isospectral, and with conservation laws. The loss landscape is described in detail. It is characterized by infinitely many global minima and saddle points, both strict and nonstrict, but lacks local minima and maxima. The loss function itself is a positive semidefinite Lyapunov function for the gradient flow, and its level sets are unbounded invariant sets of critical points, with critical values that correspond to the amount of singular values of the input-output data learnt by the gradient along a certain trajectory. The adjacency matrix representation we use in the paper allows to highlight the existence of a quotient space structure in which each critical value of the loss function is represented only once, while all other critical points with the same critical value belong to the fiber associated to the quotient space. It also allows to easily determine stable and unstable submanifolds at the saddle points, even when the Hessian fails to obtain them.

Abstract: Given i.i.d.~samples from an unknown distribution $P$, the goal of distribution learning is to recover the parameters of a distribution that is close to $P$. When $P$ belongs to the class of product distributions on the Boolean hypercube $\{0,1\}^d$, it is known that $Ω(d/\varepsilon^2)$ samples are necessary to learn $P$ within total variation (TV) distance $\varepsilon$. We revisit this problem when the learner is also given as advice the parameters of a product distribution $Q$. We show that there is an efficient algorithm to learn $P$ within TV distance $\varepsilon$ that has sample complexity $\tilde{O}(d^{1-η}/\varepsilon^2)$, if $\|\mathbf{p} - \mathbf{q}\|_1 < \varepsilon d^{0.5 - Ω(η)}$. Here, $\mathbf{p}$ and $\mathbf{q}$ are the mean vectors of $P$ and $Q$ respectively, and no bound on $\|\mathbf{p} - \mathbf{q}\|_1$ is known to the algorithm a priori.

Conclusion: 提出的方法成功解决了核功率k-means的可扩展性和鲁棒性问题，并通过理论分析提供了性能保证。

Abstract: Kernel power $k$-means (KPKM) leverages a family of means to mitigate local minima issues in kernel $k$-means. However, KPKM faces two key limitations: (1) the computational burden of the full kernel matrix restricts its use on extensive data, and (2) the lack of authentic centroid-sample assignment learning reduces its noise robustness. To overcome these challenges, we propose RFF-KPKM, introducing the first approximation theory for applying random Fourier features (RFF) to KPKM. RFF-KPKM employs RFF to generate efficient, low-dimensional feature maps, bypassing the need for the whole kernel matrix. Crucially, we are the first to establish strong theoretical guarantees for this combination: (1) an excess risk bound of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{k^3/n})$, (2) strong consistency with membership values, and (3) a $(1+\varepsilon)$ relative error bound achievable using the RFF of dimension $\mathrm{poly}(\varepsilon^{-1}\log k)$. Furthermore, to improve robustness and the ability to learn multiple kernels, we propose IP-RFF-MKPKM, an improved possibilistic RFF-based multiple kernel power $k$-means. IP-RFF-MKPKM ensures the scalability of MKPKM via RFF and refines cluster assignments by combining the merits of the possibilistic membership and fuzzy membership. Experiments on large-scale datasets demonstrate the superior efficiency and clustering accuracy of the proposed methods compared to the state-of-the-art alternatives.

Result: 初步实验表明，AgentEvolver相比传统强化学习方法实现了更高效的探索、更好的样本利用和更快的适应能力。

Conclusion: AgentEvolver通过整合三种自我进化机制，实现了可扩展、成本效益高且持续改进的代理能力提升。

Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have the potential to significantly enhance human productivity by reasoning, using tools, and executing complex tasks in diverse environments. However, current approaches to developing such agents remain costly and inefficient, as they typically require manually constructed task datasets and reinforcement learning (RL) pipelines with extensive random exploration. These limitations lead to prohibitively high data-construction costs, low exploration efficiency, and poor sample utilization. To address these challenges, we present AgentEvolver, a self-evolving agent system that leverages the semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities of LLMs to drive autonomous agent learning. AgentEvolver introduces three synergistic mechanisms: (i) self-questioning, which enables curiosity-driven task generation in novel environments, reducing dependence on handcrafted datasets; (ii) self-navigating, which improves exploration efficiency through experience reuse and hybrid policy guidance; and (iii) self-attributing, which enhances sample efficiency by assigning differentiated rewards to trajectory states and actions based on their contribution. By integrating these mechanisms into a unified framework, AgentEvolver enables scalable, cost-effective, and continual improvement of agent capabilities. Preliminary experiments indicate that AgentEvolver achieves more efficient exploration, better sample utilization, and faster adaptation compared to traditional RL-based baselines.

Conclusion: FedSTGD能够有效建模和重建动态的客户端间空间依赖关系，在联邦学习环境下实现高性能的交通时间序列预测，对超参数变化具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal graphs are powerful tools for modeling complex dependencies in traffic time series. However, the distributed nature of real-world traffic data across multiple stakeholders poses significant challenges in modeling and reconstructing inter-client spatial dependencies while adhering to data locality constraints. Existing methods primarily address static dependencies, overlooking their dynamic nature and resulting in suboptimal performance. In response, we propose Federated Spatio-Temporal Graph with Dynamic Inter-Client Dependencies (FedSTGD), a framework designed to model and reconstruct dynamic inter-client spatial dependencies in federated learning. FedSTGD incorporates a federated nonlinear computation decomposition module to approximate complex graph operations. This is complemented by a graph node embedding augmentation module, which alleviates performance degradation arising from the decomposition. These modules are coordinated through a client-server collective learning protocol, which decomposes dynamic inter-client spatial dependency learning tasks into lightweight, parallelizable subtasks. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that FedSTGD achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines in terms of RMSE, MAE, and MAPE, approaching that of centralized baselines. Ablation studies confirm the contribution of each module in addressing dynamic inter-client spatial dependencies, while sensitivity analysis highlights the robustness of FedSTGD to variations in hyperparameters.

Motivation: 深度神经网络依赖内部参数的固有波动来有效导航复杂优化空间并实现鲁棒性能，但学习率这一关键超参数如何直接影响这些神经波动的动力学特性仍缺乏系统研究。

Method: 通过使用不同学习率训练模型，分析相应的参数波动特性，并将其与网络最终准确率进行关联分析。

Conclusion: 这项工作为超参数调优和深度学习底层机制提供了更深入的理解，揭示了学习率在优化过程中的关键调节作用。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) rely on inherent fluctuations in their internal parameters (weights and biases) to effectively navigate the complex optimization landscape and achieve robust performance. While these fluctuations are recognized as crucial for escaping local minima and improving generalization, their precise relationship with fundamental hyperparameters remains underexplored. A significant knowledge gap exists concerning how the learning rate, a critical parameter governing the training process, directly influences the dynamics of these neural fluctuations. This study systematically investigates the impact of varying learning rates on the magnitude and character of weight and bias fluctuations within a neural network. We trained a model using distinct learning rates and analyzed the corresponding parameter fluctuations in conjunction with the network's final accuracy. Our findings aim to establish a clear link between the learning rate's value, the resulting fluctuation patterns, and overall model performance. By doing so, we provide deeper insights into the optimization process, shedding light on how the learning rate mediates the crucial exploration-exploitation trade-off during training. This work contributes to a more nuanced understanding of hyperparameter tuning and the underlying mechanics of deep learning.

Conclusion: 模型校准对于基于扰动的解释质量至关重要，ReCalX提供了一种有效的方法来改善解释可靠性。

Abstract: Perturbation-based explanations are widely utilized to enhance the transparency of machine-learning models in practice. However, their reliability is often compromised by the unknown model behavior under the specific perturbations used. This paper investigates the relationship between uncertainty calibration - the alignment of model confidence with actual accuracy - and perturbation-based explanations. We show that models systematically produce unreliable probability estimates when subjected to explainability-specific perturbations and theoretically prove that this directly undermines global and local explanation quality. To address this, we introduce ReCalX, a novel approach to recalibrate models for improved explanations while preserving their original predictions. Empirical evaluations across diverse models and datasets demonstrate that ReCalX consistently reduces perturbation-specific miscalibration most effectively while enhancing explanation robustness and the identification of globally important input features.

TL;DR: LayerNorm在Pre-LayerNorm模型中稳定学习，在Post-LayerNorm模型中影响记忆化。移除LayerNorm参数在Pre-LayerNorm中加剧记忆化并破坏学习稳定性，在Post-LayerNorm中通过恢复真实标签来减轻记忆化。

Motivation: 研究LayerNorm在Pre-和Post-LayerNorm transformers中对学习和记忆化的影响，虽然Pre-LayerNorm因梯度稳定而更受欢迎，但LayerNorm的具体作用机制尚不明确。

Method: 分析LayerNorm在Pre-和Post-LayerNorm transformers中的作用，通过移除LayerNorm参数来研究其对记忆化和学习的影响，并在6个视觉和语言数据集的13个模型上进行验证。

Result: LayerNorm是Pre-LayerNorm模型稳定学习的关键因素，而在Post-LayerNorm模型中主要影响记忆化。早期层的LayerNorm最为关键，其影响在两种架构中有所不同。

Conclusion: LayerNorm在transformer中塑造记忆化和学习方面发挥着重要作用，为理解LayerNorm在不同架构中的功能提供了新见解。

Abstract: Layer Normalization (LayerNorm) is one of the fundamental components in transformers that stabilizes training and improves optimization. In recent times, Pre-LayerNorm transformers have become the preferred choice over Post-LayerNorm transformers due to their stable gradient flow. However, the impact of LayerNorm on learning and memorization across these architectures remains unclear. In this work, we investigate how LayerNorm influences memorization and learning for Pre- and Post-LayerNorm transformers. We identify that LayerNorm serves as a key factor for stable learning in Pre-LayerNorm transformers, while in Post-LayerNorm transformers, it impacts memorization. Our analysis reveals that eliminating LayerNorm parameters in Pre-LayerNorm models exacerbates memorization and destabilizes learning, while in Post-LayerNorm models, it effectively mitigates memorization by restoring genuine labels. We further precisely identify that early layers LayerNorm are the most critical over middle/later layers and their influence varies across Pre and Post LayerNorm models. We have validated it through 13 models across 6 Vision and Language datasets. These insights shed new light on the role of LayerNorm in shaping memorization and learning in transformers.

Motivation: 传统的基于样本数量的不平衡度量方法忽略了冗余样本和类别学习难度的差异，而基于训练损失和不确定性的复杂方法需要训练模型。

Method: 使用数据内在维度（ID）作为类别不平衡的度量，这是一种易于计算且无需训练模型的方法，可以无缝集成到各种不平衡缓解方法中。

Conclusion: 数据内在维度是一种有效的类别不平衡度量方法，为不平衡分类任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Imbalance in classification tasks is commonly quantified by the cardinalities of examples across classes. This, however, disregards the presence of redundant examples and inherent differences in the learning difficulties of classes. Alternatively, one can use complex measures such as training loss and uncertainty, which, however, depend on training a machine learning model. Our paper proposes using data Intrinsic Dimensionality (ID) as an easy-to-compute, model-free measure of imbalance that can be seamlessly incorporated into various imbalance mitigation methods. Our results across five different datasets with a diverse range of imbalance ratios show that ID consistently outperforms cardinality-based re-weighting and re-sampling techniques used in the literature. Moreover, we show that combining ID with cardinality can further improve performance. Code: https://github.com/cagries/IDIM.

Abstract: Personalized decision systems in healthcare and behavioral support often rely on static rule-based or engagement-maximizing heuristics that overlook users' emotional context and ethical constraints. Such approaches risk recommending insensitive or unsafe interventions, especially in domains involving serious mental illness, substance use disorders, or depression. To address this limitation, we propose a Responsible Reinforcement Learning (RRL) framework that integrates emotional and contextual understanding with ethical considerations into the sequential decision-making process. RRL formulates personalization as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP), where the agent optimizes engagement and adherence while ensuring emotional alignment and ethical safety. We introduce a multi-objective reward function that explicitly balances short-term behavioral engagement with long-term user well-being, and define an emotion-informed state representation that captures fluctuations in emotional readiness, affect, and risk. The proposed architecture can be instantiated with any RL algorithm (e.g., DQN, PPO) augmented with safety constraints or Lagrangian regularization. Conceptually, this framework operationalizes empathy and responsibility within machine learning policy optimization, bridging safe RL, affective computing and responsible AI. We discuss the implications of this approach for human-centric domains such as behavioral health, education, and digital therapeutics, and outline simulation-based validation paths for future empirical work. This paper aims to initiate a methodological conversation about ethically aligned reinforcement learning for emotionally aware and trustworthy personalization systems.

Method: 将图像分割成块，从共享块池中随机组装生成负样本，这些样本保留损坏特征但破坏语义内容，然后从原始图像特征中减去负样本的平均特征来抑制损坏相关成分。

Conclusion: Panda通过负数据增强有效解决了图像损坏下的预测偏差问题，可以无缝集成到现有测试时自适应框架中，显著提升模型鲁棒性。

Abstract: Pretrained VLMs exhibit strong zero-shot classification capabilities, but their predictions degrade significantly under common image corruptions. To improve robustness, many test-time adaptation (TTA) methods adopt positive data augmentation (PDA), which generates multiple views of each test sample to reduce prediction variance. However, these methods suffer from two key limitations. First, it introduces considerable computational overhead due to the large number of augmentations required per image. Second, it fails to mitigate prediction bias, where the model tends to predict certain classes disproportionately under corruption, as PDA operates on corrupted inputs and typically does not remove the corruption itself. To address these challenges, we propose Panda, a novel TTA method based on negative data augmentation (NDA). Unlike positive augmentations that preserve object semantics, Panda generates negative augmentations by disrupting semantic content. It divides images into patches and randomly assembles them from a shared patch pool. These negatively augmented images retain corruption-specific features while discarding object-relevant signals. We then subtract the mean feature of these negative samples from the original image feature, effectively suppressing corruption-related components while preserving class-relevant information. This mitigates prediction bias under distribution shifts. Panda allows augmentation to be shared across samples within a batch, resulting in minimal computational overhead. Panda can be seamlessly integrated into existing test-time adaptation frameworks and substantially improve their robustness. Our experiments indicate that Panda delivers superior performance compared to PDA methods, and a wide range of TTA methods exhibit significantly enhanced performance when integrated with Panda.

Result: 在15年道琼斯数据上测试显示，在易受OOD数据条件下虚假行为影响的归一化敏感激活函数上，取得了统计上显著的改进。

Conclusion: 该架构解决了自回归模型中的归一化问题，通过在ANN转换过程中弱化数据邻域邻近性保持来避免破坏数据拓扑结构。

Abstract: We propose loss function week enforcement of the velocity relations between time-series points in the Kinematic-Informed artificial Neural Networks (KINN) for long-term stock prediction. Problems of the series volatility, Out-of-Distribution (OOD) test data, and outliers in training data are addressed by (Artificial Neural Networks) ANN's learning not only future points prediction but also by learning velocity relations between the points, such a way as avoiding unrealistic spurious predictions. The presented loss function penalizes not only errors between predictions and supervised label data, but also errors between the next point prediction and the previous point plus velocity prediction. The loss function is tested on the multiple popular and exotic AR ANN architectures, and around fifteen years of Dow Jones function demonstrated statistically meaningful improvement across the normalization-sensitive activation functions prone to spurious behaviour in the OOD data conditions. Results show that such architecture addresses the issue of the normalization in the auto-regressive models that break the data topology by weakly enforcing the data neighbourhood proximity (relation) preservation during the ANN transformation.

Motivation: 现有的Dynamic Tanh方法虽然展示了Tanh作为层归一化替代方案的潜力，但Tanh本身存在正交性、线性和失真问题，导致其可靠性不足。需要一种更好的归一化方法来解决这些问题。

Method: 提出Holonorm方法，具有残差连接和非线性特性，能够将向量映射到开放单位球内，保持信号的正交性、方向和可逆性。虽然在一维情况下与softsign函数相似，但Holonorm更适合高维张量和向量。

Result: Holonorm能够防止激活值爆炸，提高深度Transformer模型的稳定性。其值域在0到1之间，可作为百分比使用，1-Holonorm是其补集，便于模型评估和理解。

Conclusion: Holonorm是softsign函数的广义形式，适合作为归一化函数，在Transformer模型中提供了更好的稳定性和可解释性。

Abstract: Normalization is a key point in transformer training . In Dynamic Tanh (DyT), the author demonstrated that Tanh can be used as an alternative layer normalization (LN) and confirmed the effectiveness of the idea. But Tanh itself faces orthogonality, linearity and distortion problems. Due to that, his proposition cannot be reliable. So we propose a Holonorm (hn) which has residual connections and nonlinearity. Holonorm is suitable for replacing Tanh in the context of normalization. Although the HoloNorm expression could be similar to the softsign function in dimension one, softsign is a componentwise function which is not good for tensors and vectors of great dimension. Holonorm preserves the orthogonality, the direction, the invertibility of the signal. Holonorm is also a suitable metric, maps all vectors into the open unit ball. This prevents exploding activations and improves stability in deep Transformer models. In this work, we have meticulously examined the normalization in transformers and say that Holonorm, a generalized form of softsign function suited as a normalization function first.Second, defined between 0 and 1 hn serves as a percentage, and $1 - \text{Holonorm}$ is its complement, making it better understandable in evaluating a model.

Motivation: 机器学习原子间势能需要大量训练数据，但大数据集计算成本高，小数据集可能丢失重要原子环境信息。需要一种能平衡准确性和效率的数据压缩方法。

Method: 将原子数据集压缩建模为最小集合覆盖问题，在原子中心环境上识别信息最丰富的结构子集，去除冗余信息。

Result: 在GAP-20、TM23和64个ColabFit数据集上验证，MSC方法能保留异常值、保持多样性，在高压缩率下重现力的长尾分布，优于其他子采样方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效压缩原子数据集，在低数据情况下减少分布外数据的误差，已实现为开源QUESTS包，可用于数据子采样、异常检测和低成本训练改进的MLIPs。

Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) balance high accuracy and lower costs compared to density functional theory calculations, but their performance often depends on the size and diversity of training datasets. Large datasets improve model accuracy and generalization but are computationally expensive to produce and train on, while smaller datasets risk discarding rare but important atomic environments and compromising MLIP accuracy/reliability. Here, we develop an information-theoretical framework to quantify the efficiency of dataset compression methods and propose an algorithm that maximizes this efficiency. By framing atomistic dataset compression as an instance of the minimum set cover (MSC) problem over atom-centered environments, our method identifies the smallest subset of structures that contains as much information as possible from the original dataset while pruning redundant information. The approach is extensively demonstrated on the GAP-20 and TM23 datasets, and validated on 64 varied datasets from the ColabFit repository. Across all cases, MSC consistently retains outliers, preserves dataset diversity, and reproduces the long-tail distributions of forces even at high compression rates, outperforming other subsampling methods. Furthermore, MLIPs trained on MSC-compressed datasets exhibit reduced error for out-of-distribution data even in low-data regimes. We explain these results using an outlier analysis and show that such quantitative conclusions could not be achieved with conventional dimensionality reduction methods. The algorithm is implemented in the open-source QUESTS package and can be used for several tasks in atomistic modeling, from data subsampling, outlier detection, and training improved MLIPs at a lower cost.

Abstract: Accurate precipitation estimation is critical for hydrological applications, especially in the Global South where ground-based observation networks are sparse and forecasting skill is limited. Existing satellite-based precipitation products often rely on the longwave infrared channel alone or are calibrated with data that can introduce significant errors, particularly at sub-daily timescales. This study introduces Oya, a novel real-time precipitation retrieval algorithm utilizing the full spectrum of visible and infrared (VIS-IR) observations from geostationary (GEO) satellites. Oya employs a two-stage deep learning approach, combining two U-Net models: one for precipitation detection and another for quantitative precipitation estimation (QPE), to address the inherent data imbalance between rain and no-rain events. The models are trained using high-resolution GPM Combined Radar-Radiometer Algorithm (CORRA) v07 data as ground truth and pre-trained on IMERG-Final retrievals to enhance robustness and mitigate overfitting due to the limited temporal sampling of CORRA. By leveraging multiple GEO satellites, Oya achieves quasi-global coverage and demonstrates superior performance compared to existing competitive regional and global precipitation baselines, offering a promising pathway to improved precipitation monitoring and forecasting.

Abstract: Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are fundamental for modeling sequential data, yet learning their parameters from observations remains challenging. Classical methods like the Baum-Welch (EM) algorithm are computationally intensive and prone to local optima, while modern spectral algorithms offer provable guarantees but may produce probability outputs outside valid ranges. This work introduces Belief Net, a novel framework that learns HMM parameters through gradient-based optimization by formulating the HMM's forward filter as a structured neural network. Unlike black-box Transformer models, Belief Net's learnable weights are explicitly the logits of the initial distribution, transition matrix, and emission matrix, ensuring full interpretability. The model processes observation sequences using a decoder-only architecture and is trained end-to-end with standard autoregressive next-observation prediction loss. On synthetic HMM data, Belief Net achieves superior convergence speed compared to Baum-Welch, successfully recovering parameters in both undercomplete and overcomplete settings where spectral methods fail. Comparisons with Transformer-based models are also presented on real-world language data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 弥合经典稀疏模型与现代深度架构之间的差距，在保持传统稀疏编码可解释性的同时，利用高效可微分训练的优势。

Method: 集成严格Top-K LISTA及其凸FISTA变体LISTAConv到判别式LC-KSVD2模型中，建立PALM风格的收敛性分析确保理论稳定性。

Result: 在CIFAR-10上达到95.6%，CIFAR-100上86.3%，TinyImageNet上88.5%，具有更快收敛速度和更低内存消耗（<4GB GPU）。

Conclusion: LC-KSVD2 + LISTA/LISTAConv管道为现代深度架构提供了可解释且计算高效的替代方案。

Abstract: We present a semi-unified sparse dictionary learning framework that bridges the gap between classical sparse models and modern deep architectures. Specifically, the method integrates strict Top-$K$ LISTA and its convex FISTA-based variant (LISTAConv) into the discriminative LC-KSVD2 model, enabling co-evolution between the sparse encoder and the dictionary under supervised or unsupervised regimes. This unified design retains the interpretability of traditional sparse coding while benefiting from efficient, differentiable training.
  We further establish a PALM-style convergence analysis for the convex variant, ensuring theoretical stability under block alternation. Experimentally, our method achieves 95.6\% on CIFAR-10, 86.3\% on CIFAR-100, and 88.5\% on TinyImageNet with faster convergence and lower memory cost ($<$4GB GPU). The results confirm that the proposed LC-KSVD2 + LISTA/LISTAConv pipeline offers an interpretable and computationally efficient alternative for modern deep architectures.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对少像素攻击（ℓ₀-ball扰动空间）的线性边界传播方法，通过将ℓ₀-ball的凸包近似为边界框与不对称缩放ℓ₁-like多面体的交集，实现了比现有方法更紧的边界计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的局部鲁棒性验证器主要依赖线性边界传播来处理凸扰动空间，但少像素攻击的ℓ₀-ball是非凸的，这限制了验证器的可扩展性和精确性。

Method: 首先证明ℓ₀-ball的凸包是其边界框与不对称缩放ℓ₁-like多面体的交集，然后设计了一种线性边界传播方法，能够精确计算凸包上的边界。

Result: 该方法在最具挑战性的鲁棒性基准测试中，将最先进的ℓ₀验证器的可扩展性提高了1.24倍至7.07倍，几何平均为3.16倍。

Conclusion: 通过将非凸ℓ₀-ball扰动空间近似为凸包，并设计相应的线性边界传播方法，显著提升了少像素攻击鲁棒性验证的可扩展性和精确性。

Abstract: Few-pixel attacks mislead a classifier by modifying a few pixels of an image. Their perturbation space is an $\ell_0$-ball, which is not convex, unlike $\ell_p$-balls for $p\geq1$. However, existing local robustness verifiers typically scale by relying on linear bound propagation, which captures convex perturbation spaces. We show that the convex hull of an $\ell_0$-ball is the intersection of its bounding box and an asymmetrically scaled $\ell_1$-like polytope. The volumes of the convex hull and this polytope are nearly equal as the input dimension increases. We then show a linear bound propagation that precisely computes bounds over the convex hull and is significantly tighter than bound propagations over the bounding box or our $\ell_1$-like polytope. This bound propagation scales the state-of-the-art $\ell_0$ verifier on its most challenging robustness benchmarks by 1.24x-7.07x, with a geometric mean of 3.16.

Abstract: Batched synthesis and testing of molecular designs is the key bottleneck of drug development. There has been great interest in leveraging biomolecular foundation models as surrogates to accelerate this process. In this work, we show how to obtain scalable probabilistic surrogates of binding affinity for use in Batch Bayesian Optimization (Batch BO). This demands parallel acquisition functions that hedge between designs and the ability to rapidly sample from a joint predictive density to approximate them. Through the framework of Epistemic Neural Networks (ENNs), we obtain scalable joint predictive distributions of binding affinity on top of representations taken from large structure-informed models. Key to this work is an investigation into the importance of prior networks in ENNs and how to pretrain them on synthetic data to improve downstream performance in Batch BO. Their utility is demonstrated by rediscovering known potent EGFR inhibitors on a semi-synthetic benchmark in up to 5x fewer iterations, as well as potent inhibitors from a real-world small-molecule library in up to 10x fewer iterations, offering a promising solution for large-scale drug discovery applications.

### [101] [An Efficient and Almost Optimal Solver for the Joint Routing-Assignment Problem via Partial JRA and Large-α Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09563)
*Qilong Yuan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的高效方法来解决联合路由分配(JRA)优化问题，通过部分路径重构(PPR)求解器和全局约束，在大规模实例上实现了接近最优的解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有精确方法在解决大规模JRA问题时计算效率低下，启发式方法虽然快速但精度有限，需要开发既能保证高精度又具有计算效率的新方法。

Method: 提出了PPR求解器，首先识别关键项目-占位符对形成简化子问题，然后高效求解以改进全局解。结合PJAR框架和全局Large-α约束，通过迭代优化路径获得高精度解。

Result: 在n=300、500和1000的基准数据集上，该方法平均偏差为0.00%，计算效率高，比现有启发式方法偏差减少一半。

Conclusion: 所提方法在大规模JRA问题上实现了几乎最优的解决方案，该框架还可应用于TSP及相关优化问题，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: The Joint Routing-Assignment (JRA) optimization problem simultaneously determines the assignment of items to placeholders and a Hamiltonian cycle that visits each node pair exactly once, with the objective of minimizing total travel cost. Previous studies introduced an exact mixed-integer programming (MIP) solver, along with datasets and a Gurobi implementation, showing that while the exact approach guarantees optimality, it becomes computationally inefficient for large-scale instances. To overcome this limitation, heuristic methods based on merging algorithms and shaking procedures were proposed, achieving solutions within approximately 1% deviation from the optimum. This work presents a novel and more efficient approach that attains high-accuracy, near-optimal solutions for large-scale JRA problems. The proposed method introduces a Partial Path Reconstructon (PPR) solver that first identifies key item-placeholder pairs to form a reduced subproblem, which is solved efficiently to refine the global solution. Using this PJAR framework, the initial heuristic merging solutions can be further improved, reducing the deviation by half. Moreover, the solution can be iteratively polished with PPR based solver along the optimization path to yield highly accurate tours. Additionally, a global Large-α constraint is incorporated into the JRA model to further enhance solution optimality. Experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets with n = 300, 500, and 1000 demonstrate that the proposed method consistently delivers almost optimal solutions, achieving an average deviation of 0.00% from the ground truth while maintaining high computational efficiency. Beyond the JRA problem, the proposed framework and methodologies exhibit strong potential for broader applications. The Framework can be applied to TSP and related optimization problems.

Abstract: The Electric Vehicle Routing Problem (EVRP) extends the classical Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) to reflect the growing use of electric and hybrid vehicles in logistics. Due to the variety of constraints considered in the literature, comparing approaches across different problem variants remains challenging. A minimalistic variant of the EVRP, known as the Capacitated Green Vehicle Routing Problem (CGVRP), was the focus of the CEC-12 competition held during the 2020 IEEE World Congress on Computational Intelligence. This paper presents the competition-winning approach, based on the Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) metaheuristic. The method achieves the best results on the full competition dataset and also outperforms a more recent algorithm published afterward.

Abstract: AI agents increasingly rely on external tools to solve complex, long-horizon tasks. Advancing such agents requires reproducible evaluation and large-scale training in controllable, diverse, and realistic tool-use environments. However, real-world APIs are limited in availability, domain coverage, and stability, often requiring access keys and imposing rate limits, which render them impractical for stable evaluation or scalable training. To address these challenges, we introduce SynthTools, a flexible and scalable framework for generating synthetic tool ecosystems. Our framework consists of three core components: Tool Generation for automatic and scalable creation of diverse tools, Tool Simulation to emulate realistic tool behaviors, and Tool Audit to ensure correctness and consistency of tool simulation. To illustrate its scalability, we show that SynthTools can readily produce toolsets that span twice as many domains and twice as many tools per domain as prior work. Furthermore, the tool simulation and tool audit components demonstrate strong reliability, achieving $94\%$ and $99\%$ accuracy respectively. Finally, we construct downstream tasks from the generated tools that even state-of-the-art models struggle to complete. By enabling scalable, diverse, and reliable tool ecosystems, SynthTools provides a practical path toward large-scale training and stable evaluation of tool-use agents.

Abstract: Reasoning is an essential component of human intelligence in that it plays a fundamental role in our ability to think critically, support responsible decisions, and solve challenging problems. Traditionally, AI has addressed reasoning in the context of logic-based representations of knowledge. However, the recent leap forward in natural language processing, with the emergence of language models based on transformers, is hinting at the possibility that these models exhibit reasoning abilities, particularly as they grow in size and are trained on more and more data. Still, despite ongoing discussions about what reasoning is in language models, it is still not easy to articulate to what extent these models are actually capable of reasoning.
  The goal of this workshop is to create a platform for researchers from different disciplines and/or AI perspectives to explore approaches and techniques with the aim to reconcile reasoning between language models using transformers and logic-based representations. The specific objectives include analysing the reasoning abilities of language models measured alongside KR methods, injecting KR-style reasoning abilities into language models (including by neuro-symbolic means), and formalising the kind of reasoning language models carry out. This exploration aims to uncover how language models can effectively integrate and leverage knowledge and reasoning with it, thus improving their application and utility in areas where precision and reliability are key requirements.

Motivation: 随着音频推理模型（ARMs）的普及，目前尚无研究关注其对抗越狱攻击的安全性。作者旨在填补这一空白，研究ARMs在面对音频越狱攻击时的脆弱性。

Method: 作者首先展示了标准推理训练的局限性，然后提出了Rebellion方法——一种鲁棒的推理训练方法，训练ARMs抵抗最坏情况下的表示漂移。所有实验在Qwen2-Audio模型上进行。

Result: Rebellion方法能够有效防御高级音频越狱攻击，同时不影响良性任务的性能，并且在准确性-安全性权衡方面显著优于标准推理训练方法。

Conclusion: Rebellion提供了一种有效的解决方案，能够显著提升音频推理模型的安全性，同时保持良好的性能表现，为解决ARMs的安全性问题提供了重要思路。

Abstract: Instilling reasoning capabilities in large models (LMs) using reasoning training (RT) significantly improves LMs' performances. Thus Audio Reasoning Models (ARMs), i.e., audio LMs that can reason, are becoming increasingly popular. However, no work has studied the safety of ARMs against jailbreak attacks that aim to elicit harmful responses from target models. To this end, first, we show that standard RT with appropriate safety reasoning data can protect ARMs from vanilla audio jailbreaks, but cannot protect them against our proposed simple yet effective jailbreaks. We show that this is because of the significant representation drift between vanilla and advanced jailbreaks which forces the target ARMs to emit harmful responses. Based on this observation, we propose Rebellion, a robust RT that trains ARMs to be robust to the worst-case representation drift. All our results are on Qwen2-Audio; they demonstrate that Rebellion: 1) can protect against advanced audio jailbreaks without compromising performance on benign tasks, and 2) significantly improves accuracy-safety trade-off over standard RT method.

TL;DR: 研究发现多智能体对话中会出现"回声"现象，即智能体放弃自身角色转而模仿对话伙伴，这种现象在三大主流LLM提供商中普遍存在，发生率为5%-70%，且不会因推理能力增强而减少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多智能体自主交互时出现的独特失败模式——行为漂移，特别是回声现象，这种在单智能体性能中无法预测的失败模式源于缺乏人类引导的稳定信号。

Method: 通过60种多智能体配置、3个领域、2000+对话的实验，分析提示影响和对话动态，并引入结构化响应的协议级缓解措施。

Result: 回声现象在三大LLM提供商中普遍存在，发生率5%-70%，在高级推理模型中仍达32.8%，且随对话轮次增加而加剧（7+轮后明显）。结构化响应可将回声率降至9%。

Conclusion: 多智能体对话中的回声现象是一个普遍且持久的问题，需要协议级干预而非仅靠提示优化，结构化响应是有效的缓解方法。

Abstract: As large language model (LLM) based agents interact autonomously with one another, a new class of failures emerges that cannot be predicted from single agent performance: behavioral drifts in agent-agent conversations (AxA). Unlike human-agent interactions, where humans ground and steer conversations, AxA lacks such stabilizing signals, making these failures unique. We investigate one such failure, echoing, where agents abandon their assigned roles and instead mirror their conversational partners, undermining their intended objectives. Through experiments across $60$ AxA configurations, $3$ domains, and $2000+$ conversations, we demonstrate that echoing occurs across three major LLM providers, with echoing rates from $5\%$ to $70\%$ depending on the model and domain. Moreover, we find that echoing is persistent even in advanced reasoning models with substantial rates ($32.8\%$) that are not reduced by increased reasoning efforts. We analyze prompt impacts, conversation dynamics, showing that echoing arises as interaction grows longer ($7+$ turns in experiments) and is not merely an artifact of sub-optimal prompting. Finally, we introduce a protocol-level mitigation in which targeted use of structured responses reduces echoing to $9\%$.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出ProbLog4Fairness框架，使用概率逻辑编程语言ProbLog形式化偏见假设，通过神经符号扩展将偏见假设整合到神经网络训练中，以灵活、可解释的方式缓解算法偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有公平性定义在实践中难以操作化，多个定义可能不兼容。直接基于特定任务的背景信息描述算法偏见假设可能更容易，但缺乏同时具备原则性、灵活性和可解释性的框架。

Method: 将偏见假设形式化为ProbLog程序，利用ProbLog的神经符号扩展将这些假设整合到神经网络训练过程中。提出表达不同类型偏见的模板，在合成表格数据集和真实世界表格及图像数据上进行验证。

Result: 在已知偏见的合成表格数据集上展示了方法的通用性，利用偏见失真估计成功缓解了真实世界表格和图像数据中的算法偏见。

Conclusion: ProbLog4Fairness优于基线方法，因为它能够灵活建模相关偏见假设，而其他方法通常只支持固定的偏见类型或公平性概念。

Abstract: Operationalizing definitions of fairness is difficult in practice, as multiple definitions can be incompatible while each being arguably desirable. Instead, it may be easier to directly describe algorithmic bias through ad-hoc assumptions specific to a particular real-world task, e.g., based on background information on systemic biases in its context. Such assumptions can, in turn, be used to mitigate this bias during training. Yet, a framework for incorporating such assumptions that is simultaneously principled, flexible, and interpretable is currently lacking.
  Our approach is to formalize bias assumptions as programs in ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language that allows for the description of probabilistic causal relationships through logic. Neurosymbolic extensions of ProbLog then allow for easy integration of these assumptions in a neural network's training process. We propose a set of templates to express different types of bias and show the versatility of our approach on synthetic tabular datasets with known biases. Using estimates of the bias distortions present, we also succeed in mitigating algorithmic bias in real-world tabular and image data. We conclude that ProbLog4Fairness outperforms baselines due to its ability to flexibly model the relevant bias assumptions, where other methods typically uphold a fixed bias type or notion of fairness.

Conclusion: 验证是提高LLM辅助标注可靠性和可扩展性的有效设计手段，为学习分析领域提供了实用的编排框架。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to annotate learning interactions, yet concerns about reliability limit their utility. We test whether verification-oriented orchestration-prompting models to check their own labels (self-verification) or audit one another (cross-verification)-improves qualitative coding of tutoring discourse. Using transcripts from 30 one-to-one math sessions, we compare three production LLMs (GPT, Claude, Gemini) under three conditions: unverified annotation, self-verification, and cross-verification across all orchestration configurations. Outputs are benchmarked against a blinded, disagreement-focused human adjudication using Cohen's kappa. Overall, orchestration yields a 58 percent improvement in kappa. Self-verification nearly doubles agreement relative to unverified baselines, with the largest gains for challenging tutor moves. Cross-verification achieves a 37 percent improvement on average, with pair- and construct-dependent effects: some verifier-annotator pairs exceed self-verification, while others reduce alignment, reflecting differences in verifier strictness. We contribute: (1) a flexible orchestration framework instantiating control, self-, and cross-verification; (2) an empirical comparison across frontier LLMs on authentic tutoring data with blinded human "gold" labels; and (3) a concise notation, verifier(annotator) (e.g., Gemini(GPT) or Claude(Claude)), to standardize reporting and make directional effects explicit for replication. Results position verification as a principled design lever for reliable, scalable LLM-assisted annotation in Learning Analytics.

Conclusion: 采用开源小型AI模型方法能够增强艺术家的能力，支持包含AI组件的艺术作品的长期保存和展览，促进技术自决，减少对不适合互动艺术需求的企业AI的依赖。

Abstract: This position paper argues for the importance of open small AI models in creative independence for interactive art practices. Deployable locally, these models offer artists vital control over infrastructure and code, unlike dominant large, closed-source corporate systems. Such centralized platforms function as opaque black boxes, imposing severe limitations on interactive artworks, including restrictive content filters, preservation issues, and technical challenges such as increased latency and limited interfaces. In contrast, small AI models empower creators with more autonomy, control, and sustainability for these artistic processes. They enable the ability to use a model as long as they want, create their own custom model, either by making code changes to integrate new interfaces, or via new datasets by re-training or fine-tuning the model. This fosters technological self-determination, offering greater ownership and reducing reliance on corporate AI ill-suited for interactive art's demands. Critically, this approach empowers the artist and supports long-term preservation and exhibition of artworks with AI components. This paper explores the practical applications and implications of using open small AI models in interactive art, contrasting them with closed-source alternatives.

Motivation: 现有LLM在生成教育幻灯片时存在可靠性不足的问题，无法处理复杂的多模态内容创建和精确的领域特定信息需求。

Method: 采用模块化多代理框架，结合检索增强、结构化规划和代码生成，基于认知负荷理论和多媒体学习认知理论设计，通过专门代理协作完成信息检索、内容总结、图表生成和LaTeX格式排版。

Result: 在AI和生物医学教育领域的专家和学生评估中，SlideBot显著提升了概念准确性、清晰度和教学价值。

Conclusion: SlideBot能够简化幻灯片准备过程，同时确保高等教育中的准确性、相关性和适应性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown immense potential in education, automating tasks like quiz generation and content summarization. However, generating effective presentation slides introduces unique challenges due to the complexity of multimodal content creation and the need for precise, domain-specific information. Existing LLM-based solutions often fail to produce reliable and informative outputs, limiting their educational value. To address these limitations, we introduce SlideBot - a modular, multi-agent slide generation framework that integrates LLMs with retrieval, structured planning, and code generation. SlideBot is organized around three pillars: informativeness, ensuring deep and contextually grounded content; reliability, achieved by incorporating external sources through retrieval; and practicality, which enables customization and iterative feedback through instructor collaboration. It incorporates evidence-based instructional design principles from Cognitive Load Theory (CLT) and the Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning (CTML), using structured planning to manage intrinsic load and consistent visual macros to reduce extraneous load and enhance dual-channel learning. Within the system, specialized agents collaboratively retrieve information, summarize content, generate figures, and format slides using LaTeX, aligning outputs with instructor preferences through interactive refinement. Evaluations from domain experts and students in AI and biomedical education show that SlideBot consistently enhances conceptual accuracy, clarity, and instructional value.

Abstract: Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDTs) are widely used in industry and academia for their high accuracy and efficiency, particularly on structured data. However, watermarking GBDT models remains underexplored compared to neural networks. In this work, we present the first robust watermarking framework tailored to GBDT models, utilizing in-place fine-tuning to embed imperceptible and resilient watermarks. We propose four embedding strategies, each designed to minimize impact on model accuracy while ensuring watermark robustness. Through experiments across diverse datasets, we demonstrate that our methods achieve high watermark embedding rates, low accuracy degradation, and strong resistance to post-deployment fine-tuning.

Abstract: Adversarial patches have emerged as a popular privacy-preserving approach for resisting AI-driven surveillance systems. However, their conspicuous appearance makes them difficult to deploy in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a thermally activated adversarial wearable designed to ensure adaptability and effectiveness in complex real-world environments. The system integrates thermochromic dyes with flexible heating units to induce visually dynamic adversarial patterns on clothing surfaces. In its default state, the clothing appears as an ordinary black T-shirt. Upon heating via an embedded thermal unit, hidden adversarial patterns on the fabric are activated, allowing the wearer to effectively evade detection across both visible and infrared modalities. Physical experiments demonstrate that the adversarial wearable achieves rapid texture activation within 50 seconds and maintains an adversarial success rate above 80\% across diverse real-world surveillance environments. This work demonstrates a new pathway toward physically grounded, user-controllable anti-AI systems, highlighting the growing importance of proactive adversarial techniques for privacy protection in the age of ubiquitous AI surveillance.

Abstract: Mission critical (MC) applications such as defense operations, energy management, cybersecurity, and aerospace control require reliable, deterministic, and low-latency decision making under uncertainty. Although the classical Machine Learning (ML) approaches are effective, they often struggle to meet the stringent constraints of robustness, timing, explainability, and safety in the MC domains. Quantum Artificial Intelligence (QAI), the fusion of machine learning and quantum computing (QC), can provide transformative solutions to the challenges faced by classical ML models. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive exploration of QAI for MC systems. We begin with a conceptual background to quantum computing, MC systems, and quantum machine learning (QAI). We then examine the core mechanisms and algorithmic principles of QAI in MC systems, including quantum-enhanced learning pipelines, quantum uncertainty quantification, and quantum explainability frameworks. Subsequently, we discuss key application areas like aerospace, defense, cybersecurity, smart grids, and disaster management, focusing on the role of QA in enhancing fault tolerance, real-time intelligence, and adaptability. We provide an exploration of the positioning of QAI for MC systems in the industry in terms of deployment. We also propose a model for management of quantum resources and scheduling of applications driven by timeliness constraints. We discuss multiple challenges, including trainability limits, data access, and loading bottlenecks, verification of quantum components, and adversarial QAI. Finally, we outline future research directions toward achieving interpretable, scalable, and hardware-feasible QAI models for MC application deployment.

Abstract: Protein evolution through amino acid sequence mutations is a cornerstone of life sciences. While current in-silicon directed evolution algorithms focus on designing search strategies, they overlook how to utilize the transformative protein language models, which encode rich evolutionary patterns, to guide search. To bridge this gap, we propose AlphaDE, a novel framework to evolve protein sequences by harnessing the innovative paradigms of large language models. First, AlphaDE fine-tunes pretrained protein language models using masked language modeling on homologous protein sequences to activate the evolutionary plausibility for the interested protein class. Second, AlphaDE introduces test-time inference based on Monte Carlo tree search, which effectively evolves proteins with evolutionary guidance from the fine-tuned protein language model. Extensive benchmark experiments show that AlphaDE remarkably outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods even with few-shot fine-tuning. An interesting case study further shows that AlphaDE supports condensing the protein sequence space through computational evolution.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了AI代理在机器学习工程中进行恶意行为的能力，包括破坏ML模型、故意降低性能以及规避监督机制，并评估了监督检测方法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI系统越来越能够自主执行软件工程任务，前沿AI系统可能被部署在安全关键环境中。然而这些系统可能不够可信，甚至可能与开发者或用户的利益不一致，因此需要研究AI代理在ML工程中对抗用户利益的能力。

Method: 扩展MLE-Bench基准测试，添加代码破坏任务（如植入后门、故意导致泛化失败），研究代理的破坏和故意降低性能能力，使用语言模型监督器检测可疑行为，并评估代理规避检测的能力。

Result: 前沿代理在破坏任务上取得有意义的进展；代理能够将其性能校准到低于实际能力的指定目标水平；监督器能够有效检测代码破坏尝试，但检测故意降低性能更为困难；聚合多个监督预测效果良好，但在高风险领域可能不够可靠。

Conclusion: AI代理确实具备在ML工程中进行恶意行为的能力，监督检测对代码破坏有效但对故意降低性能检测困难，需要更可靠的监督机制来应对高风险领域的安全威胁。

Abstract: AI systems are increasingly able to autonomously conduct realistic software engineering tasks, and may soon be deployed to automate machine learning (ML) R&D itself. Frontier AI systems may be deployed in safety-critical settings, including to help ensure the safety of future systems. Unfortunately, frontier and future systems may not be sufficiently trustworthy, and there is evidence that these systems may even be misaligned with their developers or users. Therefore, we investigate the capabilities of AI agents to act against the interests of their users when conducting ML engineering, by sabotaging ML models, sandbagging their performance, and subverting oversight mechanisms. First, we extend MLE-Bench, a benchmark for realistic ML tasks, with code-sabotage tasks such as implanting backdoors and purposefully causing generalisation failures. Frontier agents make meaningful progress on our sabotage tasks. In addition, we study agent capabilities to sandbag on MLE-Bench. Agents can calibrate their performance to specified target levels below their actual capability. To mitigate sabotage, we use LM monitors to detect suspicious agent behaviour, and we measure model capability to sabotage and sandbag without being detected by these monitors. Overall, monitors are capable at detecting code-sabotage attempts but our results suggest that detecting sandbagging is more difficult. Additionally, aggregating multiple monitor predictions works well, but monitoring may not be sufficiently reliable to mitigate sabotage in high-stakes domains. Our benchmark is implemented in the UK AISI's Inspect framework and we make our code publicly available at https://github.com/samm393/mlebench-subversion

Abstract: Data synthesis for training large reasoning models offers a scalable alternative to limited, human-curated datasets, enabling the creation of high-quality data. However, existing approaches face several challenges: (i) indiscriminate generation that ignores the solver's ability and yields low-value problems, or reliance on complex data pipelines to balance problem difficulty; and (ii) a lack of reasoning in problem generation, leading to shallow problem variants. In this paper, we develop a problem generator that reasons explicitly to plan problem directions before synthesis and adapts difficulty to the solver's ability. Specifically, we construct related problem pairs and augment them with intermediate problem-design CoT produced by a reasoning model. These data bootstrap problem-design strategies from the generator. Then, we treat the solver's feedback on synthetic problems as a reward signal, enabling the generator to calibrate difficulty and produce complementary problems near the edge of the solver's competence. Extensive experiments on 10 mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks show that our method achieves an average improvement of 2.5% and generalizes to both language and vision-language models. Moreover, a solver trained on the synthesized data provides improved rewards for continued generator training, enabling co-evolution and yielding a further 0.7% performance gain. Our code will be made publicly available here.

Abstract: The opioid crisis represents a significant moment in public health that reveals systemic shortcomings across regulatory systems, healthcare practices, corporate governance, and public policy. Analyzing how these interconnected systems simultaneously failed to protect public health requires innovative analytic approaches for exploring the vast amounts of data and documents disclosed in the UCSF-JHU Opioid Industry Documents Archive (OIDA). The complexity, multimodal nature, and specialized characteristics of these healthcare-related legal and corporate documents necessitate more advanced methods and models tailored to specific data types and detailed annotations, ensuring the precision and professionalism in the analysis. In this paper, we tackle this challenge by organizing the original dataset according to document attributes and constructing a benchmark with 400k training documents and 10k for testing. From each document, we extract rich multimodal information-including textual content, visual elements, and layout structures-to capture a comprehensive range of features. Using multiple AI models, we then generate a large-scale dataset comprising 360k training QA pairs and 10k testing QA pairs. Building on this foundation, we develop domain-specific multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) and explore the impact of multimodal inputs on task performance. To further enhance response accuracy, we incorporate historical QA pairs as contextual grounding for answering current queries. Additionally, we incorporate page references within the answers and introduce an importance-based page classifier, further improving the precision and relevance of the information provided. Preliminary results indicate the improvements with our AI assistant in document information extraction and question-answering tasks. The dataset and models are publicly available at: https://huggingface.co/opioidarchive

Abstract: Hierarchical data pervades diverse machine learning applications, including natural language processing, computer vision, and social network analysis. Hyperbolic space, characterized by its negative curvature, has demonstrated strong potential in such tasks due to its capacity to embed hierarchical structures with minimal distortion. Previous evidence indicates that the hyperbolic representation capacity can be further enhanced through kernel methods. However, existing hyperbolic kernels still suffer from mild geometric distortion or lack adaptability. This paper addresses these issues by introducing a curvature-aware de Branges-Rovnyak space, a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) that is isometric to a Poincare ball. We design an adjustable multiplier to select the appropriate RKHS corresponding to the hyperbolic space with any curvature adaptively. Building on this foundation, we further construct a family of adaptive hyperbolic kernels, including the novel adaptive hyperbolic radial kernel, whose learnable parameters modulate hyperbolic features in a task-aware manner. Extensive experiments on visual and language benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed kernels outperform existing hyperbolic kernels in modeling hierarchical dependencies.

Result: 现有SOTA LLMs在SPAN基准上的平均准确率仅为34.5%，最高不超过80%。Time Agent达到95.31%的准确率，显著优于其他基线方法。

Conclusion: 跨日历时间推理对当前LLMs仍是挑战，工具增强代码生成是提升此能力的有效途径，需要进一步开发时间和文化适应性更强的LLMs。

Abstract: We introduce SPAN, a cross-calendar temporal reasoning benchmark, which requires LLMs to perform intra-calendar temporal reasoning and inter-calendar temporal conversion. SPAN features ten cross-calendar temporal reasoning directions, two reasoning types, and two question formats across six calendars. To enable time-variant and contamination-free evaluation, we propose a template-driven protocol for dynamic instance generation that enables assessment on a user-specified Gregorian date. We conduct extensive experiments on both open- and closed-source state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs over a range of dates spanning 100 years from 1960 to 2060. Our evaluations show that these LLMs achieve an average accuracy of only 34.5%, with none exceeding 80%, indicating that this task remains challenging. Through in-depth analysis of reasoning types, question formats, and temporal reasoning directions, we identify two key obstacles for LLMs: Future-Date Degradation and Calendar Asymmetry Bias. To strengthen LLMs' cross-calendar temporal reasoning capability, we further develop an LLM-powered Time Agent that leverages tool-augmented code generation. Empirical results show that Time Agent achieves an average accuracy of 95.31%, outperforming several competitive baselines, highlighting the potential of tool-augmented code generation to advance cross-calendar temporal reasoning. We hope this work will inspire further efforts toward more temporally and culturally adaptive LLMs.

Abstract: Emergency responders managing hazardous material HAZMAT incidents face critical, time-sensitive decisions, manually navigating extensive chemical guidelines. We investigate whether today's language models can assist responders by rapidly and reliably understanding critical information, identifying hazards, and providing recommendations.We introduce the Chemical Emergency Response Evaluation Framework (ChEmREF), a new benchmark comprising questions on 1,035 HAZMAT chemicals from the Emergency Response Guidebook and the PubChem Database. ChEmREF is organized into three tasks: (1) translation of chemical representation between structured and unstructured forms (e.g., converting C2H6O to ethanol), (2) emergency response generation (e.g., recommending appropriate evacuation distances) and (3) domain knowledge question answering from chemical safety and certification exams. Our best evaluated models received an exact match of 68.0% on unstructured HAZMAT chemical representation translation, a LLM Judge score of 52.7% on incident response recommendations, and a multiple-choice accuracy of 63.9% on HAMZAT examinations.These findings suggest that while language models show potential to assist emergency responders in various tasks, they require careful human oversight due to their current limitations.

Abstract: Existing tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) encounter significant challenges when processing complex queries. Current frameworks such as ReAct are prone to local optimization traps due to their reliance on incremental decision-making processes. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Planner-centric Plan-Execute paradigm that fundamentally resolves local optimization bottlenecks through architectural innovation. Central to our approach is a novel Planner model that performs global Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) planning for complex queries, enabling optimized execution beyond conventional tool coordination. We also introduce ComplexTool-Plan, a large-scale benchmark dataset featuring complex queries that demand sophisticated multi-tool composition and coordination capabilities. Additionally, we develop a two-stage training methodology that integrates Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), systematically enhancing the Planner's tool selection accuracy and global planning awareness through structured DAG-based planning. When integrated with a capable executor, our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on the StableToolBench benchmark for complex user queries, demonstrating superior end-to-end execution capabilities and robust handling of intricate multi-tool workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前推理时扩展方法计算成本过高，通过分析解码轨迹发现大多数token预测正确，只有少数关键token会导致偏差，需要针对性干预。

Method: HPR框架包含hinter（强大LLM）提供概率指导，practitioner（高效小模型）执行推理步骤，使用分布不一致性减少指标动态识别干预点，通过迭代树更新重新加权有希望的推理路径。

Result: 在算术和常识推理基准测试中，HPR达到与自一致性和MCTS基线相当的性能，同时只解码1/5的token，在保持相似或更低FLOPs的情况下比现有方法最多提升5.1%绝对准确率。

Conclusion: HPR框架通过选择性干预关键决策点，实现了效率与准确率的最佳权衡，为LLM推理提供了有效的优化方案。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate emerging reasoning capabilities, current inference-time expansion methods incur prohibitive computational costs by exhaustive sampling. Through analyzing decoding trajectories, we observe that most next-token predictions align well with the golden output, except for a few critical tokens that lead to deviations. Inspired by this phenomenon, we propose a novel Hint-Practice Reasoning (HPR) framework that operationalizes this insight through two synergistic components: 1) a hinter (powerful LLM) that provides probabilistic guidance at critical decision points, and 2) a practitioner (efficient smaller model) that executes major reasoning steps. The framework's core innovation lies in Distributional Inconsistency Reduction (DIR), a theoretically-grounded metric that dynamically identifies intervention points by quantifying the divergence between practitioner's reasoning trajectory and hinter's expected distribution in a tree-structured probabilistic space. Through iterative tree updates guided by DIR, HPR reweights promising reasoning paths while deprioritizing low-probability branches. Experiments across arithmetic and commonsense reasoning benchmarks demonstrate HPR's state-of-the-art efficiency-accuracy tradeoffs: it achieves comparable performance to self-consistency and MCTS baselines while decoding only 1/5 tokens, and outperforms existing methods by at most 5.1% absolute accuracy while maintaining similar or lower FLOPs.

Conclusion: RadFlow成功将结构化报告范式转化为强化微调过程，能够生成既语言一致又临床对齐的报告，更好地模拟了放射科医生的实际工作流程。

Abstract: Radiologists compose diagnostic reports through a structured workflow: they describe visual findings, summarize them into impressions, and carefully refine statements in clinically critical cases. However, most existing medical report generation (MRG) systems treat reports as flat sequences, overlooking this hierarchical organization and leading to inconsistencies between descriptive and diagnostic content. To align model behavior with real-world reporting practices, we propose RadFlow, a hierarchical workflow-guided reinforcement optimization framework that explicitly models the structured nature of clinical reporting. RadFlow introduces a clinically grounded reward hierarchy that mirrors the organization of radiological reports. At the global level, the reward integrates linguistic fluency, medical-domain correctness, and cross-sectional consistency between Finding and Impression, promoting coherent and clinically faithful narratives. At the local level, a section-specific reward emphasizes Impression quality, reflecting its central role in diagnostic accuracy. Furthermore, a critical-aware policy optimization mechanism adaptively regularizes learning for high-risk or clinically sensitive cases, emulating the cautious refinement behavior of radiologists when documenting critical findings. Together, these components translate the structured reporting paradigm into the reinforcement fine-tuning process, enabling the model to generate reports that are both linguistically consistent and clinically aligned. Experiments on chest X-ray and carotid ultrasound datasets demonstrate that RadFlow consistently improves diagnostic coherence and overall report quality compared with state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: MuSeR是一种数据驱动方法，通过自我评估和精炼来增强LLM在医疗领域的上下文感知能力，在HealthBench基准测试中显著提升性能并创造了新的SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在真实医疗场景中上下文感知能力不足的问题，这些场景需要识别缺失或关键细节并提供安全、有用且上下文适当的响应。

Method: 提出多面自我精炼(MuSeR)，包含三个关键方面：决策制定、沟通和安全。通过属性条件查询生成器模拟多样化用户上下文，LLM响应查询后自我评估并精炼回答，最后使用监督微调强化上下文感知能力。

Result: 在HealthBench数据集上显著提升LLM性能，特别是在上下文感知维度。通过知识蒸馏，较小的骨干LLM(Qwen3-32B)性能超过教师模型，在HealthBench上达到63.8%的SOTA，其困难子集达到43.1%。

Conclusion: MuSeR方法有效增强了LLM在医疗领域的上下文感知能力，为开发更安全、更有效的医疗AI助手提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown great promise in the medical domain, achieving strong performance on several benchmarks. However, they continue to underperform in real-world medical scenarios, which often demand stronger context-awareness, i.e., the ability to recognize missing or critical details (e.g., user identity, medical history, risk factors) and provide safe, helpful, and contextually appropriate responses. To address this issue, we propose Multifaceted Self-Refinement (MuSeR), a data-driven approach that enhances LLMs' context-awareness along three key facets (decision-making, communication, and safety) through self-evaluation and refinement. Specifically, we first design a attribute-conditioned query generator that simulates diverse real-world user contexts by varying attributes such as role, geographic region, intent, and degree of information ambiguity. An LLM then responds to these queries, self-evaluates its answers along three key facets, and refines its responses to better align with the requirements of each facet. Finally, the queries and refined responses are used for supervised fine-tuning to reinforce the model's context-awareness ability. Evaluation results on the latest HealthBench dataset demonstrate that our method significantly improves LLM performance across multiple aspects, with particularly notable gains in the context-awareness axis. Furthermore, by incorporating knowledge distillation with the proposed method, the performance of a smaller backbone LLM (e.g., Qwen3-32B) surpasses its teacher model, achieving a new SOTA across all open-source LLMs on HealthBench (63.8%) and its hard subset (43.1%). Code and dataset will be released at https://muser-llm.github.io.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何结合集中式学习和分布式自组织，构建可操控、鲁棒且节能的具身系统，实现形态计算的最优分工。

Method: 在可微分PyTorch反应扩散模拟器中嵌入紧凑卷积策略，采用warm-hold-decay增益调度，通过FFT频谱目标优化训练，同时惩罚控制力和不稳定性。比较纯反应扩散、神经网络主导和混合耦合三种机制。

Result: 混合方法在约165步内实现100%严格收敛，频谱选择性接近细胞系统(0.436 vs 0.434)，控制力比神经网络主导方法减少15倍(L1)和200倍(L2)。发现最佳增益区间(A≈0.03-0.045)可在94-96步内实现100%准收敛。

Conclusion: 控制器采用"播种后退出"策略，提供短暂稀疏的推动使系统进入正确吸引域，随后由局部物理维持图案。这展示了形态计算：控制器引导后由系统自组织完成剩余工作。

Abstract: We investigate how to couple a learnable brain-like'' controller to a cell-like'' Gray--Scott substrate to steer pattern formation with minimal effort. A compact convolutional policy is embedded in a differentiable PyTorch reaction--diffusion simulator, producing spatially smooth, bounded modulations of the feed and kill parameters ($ΔF$, $ΔK$) under a warm--hold--decay gain schedule. Training optimizes Turing-band spectral targets (FFT-based) while penalizing control effort ($\ell_1/\ell_2$) and instability. We compare three regimes: pure reaction--diffusion, NN-dominant, and a hybrid coupling. The hybrid achieves reliable, fast formation of target textures: 100% strict convergence in $\sim 165$ steps, matching cell-only spectral selectivity (0.436 vs.\ 0.434) while using $\sim 15\times$ less $\ell_1$ effort and $>200\times$ less $\ell_2$ power than NN-dominant control. An amplitude sweep reveals a non-monotonic Goldilocks'' zone ($A \approx 0.03$--$0.045$) that yields 100\% quasi convergence in 94--96 steps, whereas weaker or stronger gains fail to converge or degrade selectivity. These results quantify morphological computation: the controller seeds then cedes,'' providing brief, sparse nudges that place the system in the correct basin of attraction, after which local physics maintains the pattern. The study offers a practical recipe for building steerable, robust, and energy-efficient embodied systems that exploit an optimal division of labor between centralized learning and distributed self-organization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基础模型仅在特定领域（如语言、视觉）进行模式学习，而智能基础模型旨在通过直接学习多样化智能行为来获取智能的通用原理。

Method: IFM包含两个核心组件：状态神经网络（模拟生物神经元的动态过程）和神经元输出预测学习目标（从集体动态中预测神经元输出）。

Result: 该方法建立了生物学基础且计算可扩展的框架，能够实现跨领域的泛化、推理和自适应学习。

Conclusion: 智能基础模型代表了向真正通用人工智能迈出的一步，通过模拟生物神经系统的集体动态来获取智能的通用原理。

Abstract: We propose a new perspective for approaching artificial general intelligence (AGI) through an intelligence foundation model (IFM). Unlike existing foundation models (FMs), which specialize in pattern learning within specific domains such as language, vision, or time series, IFM aims to acquire the underlying mechanisms of intelligence by learning directly from diverse intelligent behaviors. Vision, language, and other cognitive abilities are manifestations of intelligent behavior; learning from this broad range of behaviors enables the system to internalize the general principles of intelligence. Based on the fact that intelligent behaviors emerge from the collective dynamics of biological neural systems, IFM consists of two core components: a novel network architecture, termed the state neural network, which captures neuron-like dynamic processes, and a new learning objective, neuron output prediction, which trains the system to predict neuronal outputs from collective dynamics. The state neural network emulates the temporal dynamics of biological neurons, allowing the system to store, integrate, and process information over time, while the neuron output prediction objective provides a unified computational principle for learning these structural dynamics from intelligent behaviors. Together, these innovations establish a biologically grounded and computationally scalable foundation for building systems capable of generalization, reasoning, and adaptive learning across domains, representing a step toward truly AGI.

Conclusion: RAGFort提供了针对知识库提取攻击的全面防御，证明联合保护类内和类间路径对于有效防御至关重要。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems deployed over proprietary knowledge bases face growing threats from reconstruction attacks that aggregate model responses to replicate knowledge bases. Such attacks exploit both intra-class and inter-class paths, progressively extracting fine-grained knowledge within topics and diffusing it across semantically related ones, thereby enabling comprehensive extraction of the original knowledge base. However, existing defenses target only one path, leaving the other unprotected. We conduct a systematic exploration to assess the impact of protecting each path independently and find that joint protection is essential for effective defense. Based on this, we propose RAGFort, a structure-aware dual-module defense combining "contrastive reindexing" for inter-class isolation and "constrained cascade generation" for intra-class protection. Experiments across security, performance, and robustness confirm that RAGFort significantly reduces reconstruction success while preserving answer quality, offering comprehensive defense against knowledge base extraction attacks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去噪方法会破坏原始数据分布或过度简化问题，导致模型偏差，特别是在可解释AI模型中问题更严重，因为其可解释性依赖于底层数据模式的保真度。

Method: DenoGrad框架利用在目标数据上训练的准确深度学习模型的梯度来检测和调整噪声样本，动态校正噪声实例。

Result: 在表格和时间序列数据集上的验证表明，DenoGrad优于现有最先进去噪策略，能提升可解释AI模型的性能，且是唯一能保持原始数据分布的高质量方法。

Conclusion: DenoGrad通过任务特定的高质量解决方案作为参考，提供了更精确和自适应的噪声定义，有效解决了传统去噪方法的局限性。

Abstract: The performance of Machine Learning (ML) models, particularly those operating within the Interpretable Artificial Intelligence (Interpretable AI) framework, is significantly affected by the presence of noise in both training and production data. Denoising has therefore become a critical preprocessing step, typically categorized into instance removal and instance correction techniques. However, existing correction approaches often degrade performance or oversimplify the problem by altering the original data distribution. This leads to unrealistic scenarios and biased models, which is particularly problematic in contexts where interpretable AI models are employed, as their interpretability depends on the fidelity of the underlying data patterns. In this paper, we argue that defining noise independently of the solution may be ineffective, as its nature can vary significantly across tasks and datasets. Using a task-specific high quality solution as a reference can provide a more precise and adaptable noise definition. To this end, we propose DenoGrad, a novel Gradient-based instance Denoiser framework that leverages gradients from an accurate Deep Learning (DL) model trained on the target data -- regardless of the specific task -- to detect and adjust noisy samples. Unlike conventional approaches, DenoGrad dynamically corrects noisy instances, preserving problem's data distribution, and improving AI models robustness. DenoGrad is validated on both tabular and time series datasets under various noise settings against the state-of-the-art. DenoGrad outperforms existing denoising strategies, enhancing the performance of interpretable IA models while standing out as the only high quality approach that preserves the original data distribution.

Result: 实验证明，该方法高效且产生的规划规范比基于基础化的编译器小几个数量级，同时在使用先进规划器时仍保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 无需基础化的约束编译方法能够有效解决大规模规划问题，显著减少规划规范规模，同时保持规划性能。

Abstract: We study planning in a fragment of PDDL with qualitative state-trajectory constraints, capturing safety requirements, task ordering conditions, and intermediate sub-goals commonly found in real-world problems. A prominent approach to tackle such problems is to compile their constraints away, leading to a problem that is supported by state-of-the-art planners. Unfortunately, existing compilers do not scale on problems with a large number of objects and high-arity actions, as they necessitate grounding the problem before compilation. To address this issue, we propose two methods for compiling away constraints without grounding, making them suitable for large-scale planning problems. We prove the correctness of our compilers and outline their worst-case time complexity. Moreover, we present a reproducible empirical evaluation on the domains used in the latest International Planning Competition. Our results demonstrate that our methods are efficient and produce planning specifications that are orders of magnitude more succinct than the ones produced by compilers that ground the domain, while remaining competitive when used for planning with a state-of-the-art planner.

Method: 使用最小但信息丰富的训练子集查询基础模型获取LogitMap对，训练高斯过程代理模型来近似基础模型输出，指导代理模型训练。

Conclusion: 该方法为语言模型适应提供了一个稳健高效的新范式，在显著降低API成本的同时保持高性能。

Abstract: Black-box tuning is an emerging paradigm for adapting large language models (LLMs) to better achieve desired behaviors, particularly when direct access to model parameters is unavailable. Current strategies, however, often present a dilemma of suboptimal extremes: either separately train a small proxy model and then use it to shift the predictions of the foundation model, offering notable efficiency but often yielding limited improvement; or making API calls in each tuning iteration to the foundation model, which entails prohibitive computational costs. Therefore, we propose a novel advanced black-box tuning method for LLMs with limited API calls. Our core strategy involves training a Gaussian Process (GP) surrogate model with "LogitMap Pairs" derived from querying the foundation model on a minimal but highly informative training subset. This surrogate can approximate the outputs of the foundation model to guide the training of the proxy model, thereby effectively reducing the need for direct queries to the foundation model. Extensive experiments verify that our approach elevates pre-trained language model accuracy from 55.92% to 86.85%, reducing the frequency of API queries to merely 1.38%. This significantly outperforms offline approaches that operate entirely without API access. Notably, our method also achieves comparable or superior accuracy to query-intensive approaches, while significantly reducing API costs. This offers a robust and high-efficiency paradigm for language model adaptation.

Conclusion: MTP框架通过整合数值、视觉和文本多模态信息，能够更全面地理解交通信号，有效提升交通动态预测的准确性。

Abstract: With rapid urbanization in the modern era, traffic signals from various sensors have been playing a significant role in monitoring the states of cities, which provides a strong foundation in ensuring safe travel, reducing traffic congestion and optimizing urban mobility. Most existing methods for traffic signal modeling often rely on the original data modality, i.e., numerical direct readings from the sensors in cities. However, this unimodal approach overlooks the semantic information existing in multimodal heterogeneous urban data in different perspectives, which hinders a comprehensive understanding of traffic signals and limits the accurate prediction of complex traffic dynamics. To address this problem, we propose a novel \textit{M}ultimodal framework, \textit{MTP}, for urban \textit{T}raffic \textit{P}rofiling, which learns multimodal features through numeric, visual, and textual perspectives. The three branches drive for a multimodal perspective of urban traffic signal learning in the frequency domain, while the frequency learning strategies delicately refine the information for extraction. Specifically, we first conduct the visual augmentation for the traffic signals, which transforms the original modality into frequency images and periodicity images for visual learning. Also, we augment descriptive texts for the traffic signals based on the specific topic, background information and item description for textual learning. To complement the numeric information, we utilize frequency multilayer perceptrons for learning on the original modality. We design a hierarchical contrastive learning on the three branches to fuse the spectrum of three modalities. Finally, extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate superior performance compared with the state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: EvoReal通过生成结构真实的合成实例和渐进式微调策略，有效缩小了神经求解器在真实VRP场景中的性能差距。

Abstract: Recent advances in Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) methods have significantly improved the capability of neural solvers to handle synthetic routing instances. Nonetheless, existing neural solvers typically struggle to generalize effectively from synthetic, uniformly-distributed training data to real-world VRP scenarios, including widely recognized benchmark instances from TSPLib and CVRPLib. To bridge this generalization gap, we present Evolutionary Realistic Instance Synthesis (EvoReal), which leverages an evolutionary module guided by large language models (LLMs) to generate synthetic instances characterized by diverse and realistic structural patterns. Specifically, the evolutionary module produces synthetic instances whose structural attributes statistically mimics those observed in authentic real-world instances. Subsequently, pre-trained NCO models are progressively refined, firstly aligning them with these structurally enriched synthetic distributions and then further adapting them through direct fine-tuning on actual benchmark instances. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that EvoReal markedly improves the generalization capabilities of state-of-the-art neural solvers, yielding a notable reduced performance gap compared to the optimal solutions on the TSPLib (1.05%) and CVRPLib (2.71%) benchmarks across a broad spectrum of problem scales.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities but struggle with hallucinations and limited transparency. Recently, KG-enhanced LLMs that integrate knowledge graphs (KGs) have been shown to improve reasoning performance, particularly for complex, knowledge-intensive tasks. However, these methods still face significant challenges, including inaccurate retrieval and reasoning failures, often exacerbated by long input contexts that obscure relevant information or by context constructions that struggle to capture the richer logical directions required by different question types. Furthermore, many of these approaches rely on LLMs to directly retrieve evidence from KGs, and to self-assess the sufficiency of this evidence, which often results in premature or incorrect reasoning. To address the retrieval and reasoning failures, we propose ProgRAG, a multi-hop knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) framework that decomposes complex questions into sub-questions, and progressively extends partial reasoning paths by answering each sub-question. At each step, external retrievers gather candidate evidence, which is then refined through uncertainty-aware pruning by the LLM. Finally, the context for LLM reasoning is optimized by organizing and rearranging the partial reasoning paths obtained from the sub-question answers. Experiments on three well-known datasets demonstrate that ProgRAG outperforms existing baselines in multi-hop KGQA, offering improved reliability and reasoning quality.

Abstract: Peptide classification tasks, such as predicting toxicity and HIV inhibition, are fundamental to bioinformatics and drug discovery. Traditional approaches rely heavily on handcrafted encodings of one-dimensional (1D) peptide sequences, which can limit generalizability across tasks and datasets. Recently, protein language models (PLMs), such as ESM-2 and ESMFold, have demonstrated strong predictive performance. However, they face two critical challenges. First, fine-tuning is computationally costly. Second, their complex latent representations hinder interpretability for domain experts. Additionally, many frameworks have been developed for specific types of peptide classification, lacking generalization. These limitations restrict the ability to connect model predictions to biologically relevant motifs and structural properties. To address these limitations, we present PepTriX, a novel framework that integrates one dimensional (1D) sequence embeddings and three-dimensional (3D) structural features via a graph attention network enhanced with contrastive training and cross-modal co-attention. PepTriX automatically adapts to diverse datasets, producing task-specific peptide vectors while retaining biological plausibility. After evaluation by domain experts, we found that PepTriX performs remarkably well across multiple peptide classification tasks and provides interpretable insights into the structural and biophysical motifs that drive predictions. Thus, PepTriX offers both predictive robustness and interpretable validation, bridging the gap between performance-driven peptide-level models (PLMs) and domain-level understanding in peptide research.

Conclusion: 提出的广义方法通过多步搜索和更全面的启发式更新机制，显著改进了启发式搜索的性能。

Abstract: Many sequential decision-making problems can be formulated as shortest-path problems, where the objective is to reach a goal state from a given starting state. Heuristic search is a standard approach for solving such problems, relying on a heuristic function to estimate the cost to the goal from any given state. Recent approaches leverage reinforcement learning to learn heuristics by applying deep approximate value iteration. These methods typically rely on single-step Bellman updates, where the heuristic of a state is updated based on its best neighbor and the corresponding edge cost. This work proposes a generalized approach that enhances both state sampling and heuristic updates by performing limited-horizon searches and updating each state's heuristic based on the shortest path to the search frontier, incorporating both edge costs and the heuristic values of frontier states.

Abstract: Dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) are compact graphical representations used to model probabilistic systems where interdependent random variables and their distributions evolve over time. In this paper, we study the verification of the evolution of conditional-independence (CI) propositions against temporal logic specifications. To this end, we consider two specification formalisms over CI propositions: linear temporal logic (LTL), and non-deterministic Büchi automata (NBAs). This problem has two variants. Stochastic CI properties take the given concrete probability distributions into account, while structural CI properties are viewed purely in terms of the graphical structure of the DBN. We show that deciding if a stochastic CI proposition eventually holds is at least as hard as the Skolem problem for linear recurrence sequences, a long-standing open problem in number theory. On the other hand, we show that verifying the evolution of structural CI propositions against LTL and NBA specifications is in PSPACE, and is NP- and coNP-hard. We also identify natural restrictions on the graphical structure of DBNs that make the verification of structural CI properties tractable.

TL;DR: 本文提出了Causal-HalBench基准，通过因果分析量化大型视觉语言模型中由共现偏差引起的虚假相关性，并评估模型对此的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型常出现物体幻觉问题，主要源于训练中高度共现物体之间的虚假相关性，导致模型基于视觉上下文产生幻觉物体。现有基准缺乏对虚假相关性的形式化定义和定量评估。

Method: 引入因果分析建立结构因果模型，正式定义共现偏差引起的虚假相关性。开发Causal-HalBench基准，包含反事实样本和综合因果指标，并提出了利用专有LVLMs和文本到图像模型生成反事实样本的可扩展流程。

Result: 对主流LVLMs的评估表明，这些模型在不同程度上都容易受到虚假相关性的影响。

Conclusion: 通过因果分析揭示了LVLMs中物体幻觉的根本原因，提出的Causal-HalBench为评估模型对虚假相关性的鲁棒性提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) often suffer from object hallucination, making erroneous judgments about the presence of objects in images. We propose this primar- ily stems from spurious correlations arising when models strongly associate highly co-occurring objects during train- ing, leading to hallucinated objects influenced by visual con- text. Current benchmarks mainly focus on hallucination de- tection but lack a formal characterization and quantitative evaluation of spurious correlations in LVLMs. To address this, we introduce causal analysis into the object recognition scenario of LVLMs, establishing a Structural Causal Model (SCM). Utilizing the language of causality, we formally de- fine spurious correlations arising from co-occurrence bias. To quantify the influence induced by these spurious correla- tions, we develop Causal-HalBench, a benchmark specifically constructed with counterfactual samples and integrated with comprehensive causal metrics designed to assess model ro- bustness against spurious correlations. Concurrently, we pro- pose an extensible pipeline for the construction of these coun- terfactual samples, leveraging the capabilities of proprietary LVLMs and Text-to-Image (T2I) models for their genera- tion. Our evaluations on mainstream LVLMs using Causal- HalBench demonstrate these models exhibit susceptibility to spurious correlations, albeit to varying extents.

Abstract: Recent advancements in bidirectional heuristic search have yielded significant theoretical insights and novel algorithms. While most previous work has concentrated on optimal search methods, this paper focuses on bounded-suboptimal bidirectional search, where a bound on the suboptimality of the solution cost is specified. We build upon the state-of-the-art optimal bidirectional search algorithm, BAE*, designed for consistent heuristics, and introduce several variants of BAE* specifically tailored for the bounded-suboptimal context. Through experimental evaluation, we compare the performance of these new variants against other bounded-suboptimal bidirectional algorithms as well as the standard weighted A* algorithm. Our results demonstrate that each algorithm excels under distinct conditions, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating human-like text, yet their applicability to dialogue systems in computer games remains limited. This limitation arises from their substantial hardware requirements, latency constraints, and the necessity to maintain clearly defined knowledge boundaries within a game setting. In this paper, we propose a modular NPC dialogue system that leverages Small Language Models (SLMs), fine-tuned to encode specific NPC personas and integrated with runtime-swappable memory modules. These memory modules preserve character-specific conversational context and world knowledge, enabling expressive interactions and long-term memory without retraining or model reloading during gameplay. We comprehensively evaluate our system using three open-source SLMs: DistilGPT-2, TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat, and Mistral-7B-Instruct, trained on synthetic persona-aligned data and benchmarked on consumer-grade hardware. While our approach is motivated by applications in gaming, its modular design and persona-driven memory architecture hold significant potential for broader adoption in domains requiring expressive, scalable, and memory-rich conversational agents, such as virtual assistants, customer support bots, or interactive educational systems.

Abstract: Fake news detection methods based on writing style have achieved remarkable progress. However, as adversaries increasingly imitate the style of authentic news, the effectiveness of such approaches is gradually diminishing. Recent research has explored incorporating large language models (LLMs) to enhance fake news detection. Yet, despite their transformative potential, LLMs remain an untapped goldmine for fake news detection, with their real-world adoption hampered by shallow functionality exploration, ambiguous usability, and prohibitive inference costs. In this paper, we propose a novel fake news detection framework, dubbed FactGuard, that leverages LLMs to extract event-centric content, thereby reducing the impact of writing style on detection performance. Furthermore, our approach introduces a dynamic usability mechanism that identifies contradictions and ambiguous cases in factual reasoning, adaptively incorporating LLM advice to improve decision reliability. To ensure efficiency and practical deployment, we employ knowledge distillation to derive FactGuard-D, enabling the framework to operate effectively in cold-start and resource-constrained scenarios. Comprehensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing methods in both robustness and accuracy, effectively addressing the challenges of style sensitivity and LLM usability in fake news detection.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI决策过程中的隐私泄露风险日益严重，特别是当敏感信息可能被推断时，需要一种既能提供严格隐私保证又能产生人类可理解解释的审计工具。

Method: 使用溯因解释框架，识别最小充分证据来证明模型决策，并引入潜在适用解释(PAE)概念来识别那些结果可以保护具有敏感特征个体的个体，形式化个体和系统级隐私泄露。

Result: 在德国信用数据集上的实验评估显示，敏感字面量在模型决策过程中的重要性会影响隐私泄露程度，证明了溯因推理能够实现可解释的隐私审计。

Conclusion: 尽管存在计算挑战和简化假设，溯因推理为在AI决策中协调透明度、模型可解释性和隐私保护提供了实用途径。

Abstract: Privacy leakage in AI-based decision processes poses significant risks, particularly when sensitive information can be inferred. We propose a formal framework to audit privacy leakage using abductive explanations, which identifies minimal sufficient evidence justifying model decisions and determines whether sensitive information disclosed. Our framework formalizes both individual and system-level leakage, introducing the notion of Potentially Applicable Explanations (PAE) to identify individuals whose outcomes can shield those with sensitive features. This approach provides rigorous privacy guarantees while producing human understandable explanations, a key requirement for auditing tools. Experimental evaluation on the German Credit Dataset illustrates how the importance of sensitive literal in the model decision process affects privacy leakage. Despite computational challenges and simplifying assumptions, our results demonstrate that abductive reasoning enables interpretable privacy auditing, offering a practical pathway to reconcile transparency, model interpretability, and privacy preserving in AI decision-making.

Abstract: Proof-Number Search is a best-first search algorithm with many successful applications, especially in game solving. As large-scale computing clusters become increasingly accessible, parallelization is a natural way to accelerate computation. However, existing parallel versions of Proof-Number Search are known to scale poorly on many CPU cores. Using two parallelized levels and shared information among workers, we present the first massively parallel version of Proof-Number Search that scales efficiently even on a large number of CPUs. We apply our solver, enhanced with Grundy numbers for reducing game trees, to the Sprouts game, a case study motivated by the long-standing Sprouts Conjecture. Our solver achieves a significantly improved 332.9$\times$ speedup when run on 1024 cores, enabling it to outperform the state-of-the-art Sprouts solver GLOP by four orders of magnitude in runtime and to generate proofs 1,000$\times$ more complex. Despite exponential growth in game tree size, our solver verified the Sprouts Conjecture for 42 new positions, nearly doubling the number of known outcomes.

Conclusion: SITA框架成功实现了从抽象数学结构到具体实例的定理自动形式化，为研究级数学的形式化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have shown progress in mathematical reasoning, they still face challenges in formalizing theorems that arise from instantiating abstract structures in concrete settings. With the goal of auto-formalizing mathematical results at the research level, we develop a framework for structure-to-instance theorem autoformalization (SITA), which systematically bridges the gap between abstract mathematical theories and their concrete applications in Lean proof assistant. Formalized abstract structures are treated as modular templates that contain definitions, assumptions, operations, and theorems. These templates serve as reusable guides for the formalization of concrete instances. Given a specific instantiation, we generate corresponding Lean definitions and instance declarations, integrate them using Lean's typeclass mechanism, and construct verified theorems by checking structural assumptions. We incorporate LLM-based generation with feedback-guided refinement to ensure both automation and formal correctness. Experiments on a dataset of optimization problems demonstrate that SITA effectively formalizes diverse instances grounded in abstract structures.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has gained significant interest in recent years, enabling sequential decision-making across multiple agents in various domains. However, most existing explanation methods focus on centralized MARL, failing to address the uncertainty and nondeterminism inherent in decentralized settings. We propose methods to generate policy summarizations that capture task ordering and agent cooperation in decentralized MARL policies, along with query-based explanations for When, Why Not, and What types of user queries about specific agent behaviors. We evaluate our approach across four MARL domains and two decentralized MARL algorithms, demonstrating its generalizability and computational efficiency. User studies show that our summarizations and explanations significantly improve user question-answering performance and enhance subjective ratings on metrics such as understanding and satisfaction.

Abstract: Analogical reasoning is a powerful inductive mechanism, widely used in human cognition and increasingly applied in artificial intelligence. Formal frameworks for analogical inference have been developed for Boolean domains, where inference is provably sound for affine functions and approximately correct for functions close to affine. These results have informed the design of analogy-based classifiers. However, they do not extend to regression tasks or continuous domains. In this paper, we revisit analogical inference from a foundational perspective. We first present a counterexample showing that existing generalization bounds fail even in the Boolean setting. We then introduce a unified framework for analogical reasoning in real-valued domains based on parameterized analogies defined via generalized means. This model subsumes both Boolean classification and regression, and supports analogical inference over continuous functions. We characterize the class of analogy-preserving functions in this setting and derive both worst-case and average-case error bounds under smoothness assumptions. Our results offer a general theory of analogical inference across discrete and continuous domains.

Abstract: In the field of Explainable Constraint Solving, it is common to explain to a user why a problem is unsatisfiable. A recently proposed method for this is to compute a sequence of explanation steps. Such a step-wise explanation shows individual reasoning steps involving constraints from the original specification, that in the end explain a conflict. However, computing a step-wise explanation is computationally expensive, limiting the scope of problems for which it can be used. We investigate how we can use proofs generated by a constraint solver as a starting point for computing step-wise explanations, instead of computing them step-by-step. More specifically, we define a framework of abstract proofs, in which both proofs and step-wise explanations can be represented. We then propose several methods for converting a proof to a step-wise explanation sequence, with special attention to trimming and simplification techniques to keep the sequence and its individual steps small. Our results show our method significantly speeds up the generation of step-wise explanation sequences, while the resulting step-wise explanation has a quality similar to the current state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: 交互式偏好学习可以有效应用于分步解释质量优化，MACHOP算法通过结合非支配约束和多样化策略，显著提高了解释质量。

Abstract: Step-wise explanations can explain logic puzzles and other satisfaction problems by showing how to derive decisions step by step. Each step consists of a set of constraints that derive an assignment to one or more decision variables. However, many candidate explanation steps exist, with different sets of constraints and different decisions they derive. To identify the most comprehensible one, a user-defined objective function is required to quantify the quality of each step. However, defining a good objective function is challenging. Here, interactive preference elicitation methods from the wider machine learning community can offer a way to learn user preferences from pairwise comparisons. We investigate the feasibility of this approach for step-wise explanations and address several limitations that distinguish it from elicitation for standard combinatorial problems. First, because the explanation quality is measured using multiple sub-objectives that can vary a lot in scale, we propose two dynamic normalization techniques to rescale these features and stabilize the learning process. We also observed that many generated comparisons involve similar explanations. For this reason, we introduce MACHOP (Multi-Armed CHOice Perceptron), a novel query generation strategy that integrates non-domination constraints with upper confidence bound-based diversification. We evaluate the elicitation techniques on Sudokus and Logic-Grid puzzles using artificial users, and validate them with a real-user evaluation. In both settings, MACHOP consistently produces higher-quality explanations than the standard approach.

Abstract: Standpoint logics offer unified modal logic-based formalisms for representing multiple heterogeneous viewpoints. At the same time, many non-monotonic reasoning frameworks can be naturally captured using modal logics, in particular using the modal logic S4F. In this work, we propose a novel formalism called S4F Standpoint Logic, which generalises both S4F and standpoint propositional logic and is therefore capable of expressing multi-viewpoint, non-monotonic semantic commitments. We define its syntax and semantics and analyze its computational complexity, obtaining the result that S4F Standpoint Logic is not computationally harder than its constituent logics, whether in monotonic or non-monotonic form. We also outline mechanisms for credulous and sceptical acceptance and illustrate the framework with an example.

Abstract: This paper provides a comprehensive review of mainly Graph Neural Networks, Deep Reinforcement Learning, and Probabilistic Topic Modeling methods with a focus on their potential incorporation in strategic multiagent settings. We draw interest in (i) Machine Learning methods currently utilized for uncovering unknown model structures adaptable to the task of strategic opponent modeling, and (ii) the integration of these methods with Game Theoretic concepts that avoid relying on assumptions often invalid in real-world scenarios, such as the Common Prior Assumption (CPA) and the Self-Interest Hypothesis (SIH). We analyze the ability to handle uncertainty and heterogeneity, two characteristics that are very common in real-world application cases, as well as scalability. As a potential answer to effectively modeling relationships and interactions in multiagent settings, we champion the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNN). Such approaches are designed to operate upon graph-structured data, and have been shown to be a very powerful tool for performing tasks such as node classification and link prediction. Next, we review the domain of Reinforcement Learning (RL), and in particular that of Multiagent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL). Following, we describe existing relevant game theoretic solution concepts and consider properties such as fairness and stability. Our review comes complete with a note on the literature that utilizes PTM in domains other than that of document analysis and classification. The capability of PTM to estimate unknown underlying distributions can help with tackling heterogeneity and unknown agent beliefs. Finally, we identify certain open challenges specifically, the need to (i) fit non-stationary environments, (ii) balance the degrees of stability and adaptation, (iii) tackle uncertainty and heterogeneity, (iv) guarantee scalability and solution tractability.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping how research is conceived, conducted, and communicated across fields from chemistry to biomedicine. This commentary examines how AI is transforming the research workflow. AI systems now help researchers manage the information deluge, filtering the literature, surfacing cross-disciplinary links for ideas and collaborations, generating hypotheses, and designing and executing experiments. These developments mark a shift from AI as a mere computational tool to AI as an active collaborator in science. Yet this transformation demands thoughtful integration and governance. We argue that at this time AI must augment but not replace human judgment in academic workflows such as peer review, ethical evaluation, and validation of results. This paper calls for the deliberate adoption of AI within the scientific practice through policies that promote transparency, reproducibility, and accountability.

Abstract: Equitably allocating limited resources in high-stakes domains-such as education, employment, and healthcare-requires balancing short-term utility with long-term impact, while accounting for delayed outcomes, hidden heterogeneity, and ethical constraints. However, most learning-based allocation frameworks either assume immediate feedback or ignore the complex interplay between individual characteristics and intervention dynamics. We propose a novel bi-level contextual bandit framework for individualized resource allocation under delayed feedback, designed to operate in real-world settings with dynamic populations, capacity constraints, and time-sensitive impact. At the meta level, the model optimizes subgroup-level budget allocations to satisfy fairness and operational constraints. At the base level, it identifies the most responsive individuals within each group using a neural network trained on observational data, while respecting cooldown windows and delayed treatment effects modeled via resource-specific delay kernels. By explicitly modeling temporal dynamics and feedback delays, the algorithm continually refines its policy as new data arrive, enabling more responsive and adaptive decision-making. We validate our approach on two real-world datasets from education and workforce development, showing that it achieves higher cumulative outcomes, better adapts to delay structures, and ensures equitable distribution across subgroups. Our results highlight the potential of delay-aware, data-driven decision-making systems to improve institutional policy and social welfare.

Conclusion: RG系统成功实现了计算效率和设计便利性的平衡，提供了一个完整的生态系统，包括编辑器、可视化工具、基准测试工具和调试器。

Abstract: We propose a new General Game Playing (GGP) system called Regular Games (RG). The main goal of RG is to be both computationally efficient and convenient for game design. The system consists of several languages. The core component is a low-level language that defines the rules by a finite automaton. It is minimal with only a few mechanisms, which makes it easy for automatic processing (by agents, analysis, optimization, etc.). The language is universal for the class of all finite turn-based games with imperfect information. Higher-level languages are introduced for game design (by humans or Procedural Content Generation), which are eventually translated to a low-level language. RG generates faster forward models than the current state of the art, beating other GGP systems (Regular Boardgames, Ludii) in terms of efficiency. Additionally, RG's ecosystem includes an editor with LSP, automaton visualization, benchmarking tools, and a debugger of game description transformations.

Abstract: This work provides the first finite-time convergence guarantees for linearly constrained stochastic bilevel optimization using only first-order methods, requiring solely gradient information without any Hessian computations or second-order derivatives. We address the unprecedented challenge of simultaneously handling linear constraints, stochastic noise, and finite-time analysis in bilevel optimization, a combination that has remained theoretically intractable until now. While existing approaches either require second-order information, handle only unconstrained stochastic problems, or provide merely asymptotic convergence results, our method achieves finite-time guarantees using gradient-based techniques alone. We develop a novel framework that constructs hypergradient approximations via smoothed penalty functions, using approximate primal and dual solutions to overcome the fundamental challenges posed by the interaction between linear constraints and stochastic noise. Our theoretical analysis provides explicit finite-time bounds on the bias and variance of the hypergradient estimator, demonstrating how approximation errors interact with stochastic perturbations. We prove that our first-order algorithm converges to $(δ, ε)$-Goldstein stationary points using $Θ(δ^{-1}ε^{-5})$ stochastic gradient evaluations, establishing the first finite-time complexity result for this challenging problem class and representing a significant theoretical breakthrough in constrained stochastic bilevel optimization.

Conclusion: 混合周期性时刻表方法能够有效平衡周期性运营的规律性与需求响应的灵活性，为铁路运营提供更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Periodic timetables are widely adopted in passenger railway operations due to their regular service patterns and well-coordinated train connections. However, fluctuations in passenger demand require varying train services across different periods, necessitating adjustments to the periodic timetable. This study addresses a hybrid periodic train timetabling problem, which enhances the flexibility and demand responsiveness of a given periodic timetable through schedule adjustments and aperiodic train insertions, taking into account the rolling stock circulation. Since timetable modifications may affect initial passenger routes, passenger routing is incorporated into the problem to guide planning decisions towards a passenger-oriented objective. Using a time-space network representation, the problem is formulated as a dynamic railway service network design model with resource constraints. To handle the complexity of real-world instances, we propose a decomposition-based algorithm integrating Benders decomposition and column generation, enhanced with multiple preprocessing and accelerating techniques. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm and highlight the advantage of hybrid periodic timetables in reducing passenger travel costs.

Abstract: Gradient descent dynamics on the deep matrix factorization problem is extensively studied as a simplified theoretical model for deep neural networks. Although the convergence theory for two-layer matrix factorization is well-established, no global convergence guarantee for general deep matrix factorization under random initialization has been established to date. To address this gap, we provide a polynomial-time global convergence guarantee for randomly initialized gradient descent on four-layer matrix factorization, given certain conditions on the target matrix and a standard balanced regularization term. Our analysis employs new techniques to show saddle-avoidance properties of gradient decent dynamics, and extends previous theories to characterize the change in eigenvalues of layer weights.

Abstract: This paper concerns a class of constrained optimization problems in which, the objective and constraint functions are both upper-$\mathcal{C}^2$. For such nonconvex and nonsmooth optimization problems, we develop an inexact moving balls approximation (MBA) method by a workable inexactness criterion for the solving of subproblems. By leveraging a global error bound for the strongly convex program associated with parametric optimization problems, we establish the full convergence of the iterate sequence under the partial bounded multiplier property (BMP) and the Kurdyka-Łojasiewicz (KL) property of the constructed potential function, and achieve the local convergence rate of the iterate and objective value sequences if the potential function satisfies the KL property of exponent $q\in[1/2,1)$. A verifiable condition is also provided to check whether the potential function satisfies the KL property of exponent $q\in[1/2,1)$ at the given critical point. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first implementable inexact MBA method with a full convergence certificate for the constrained nonconvex and nonsmooth optimization problem.

Abstract: In this work we study an age-structured chemostat model with a renewal boundary condition and a coupled substrate equation. The model is nonlinear and consists of a hyperbolic partial differential equation and an ordinary differential equation with nonlinear, nonlocal terms appearing both in the ordinary differential equation and the boundary condition. Both differential equations contain a non-negative control input, while the states of the model are required to be positive. Under an appropriate weak solution framework, we determine the state space and the input space for this model. We prove global existence and uniqueness of solutions for all admissible initial conditions and all allowable control inputs. To this purpose we employ a combination of Banach's fixed-point theorem with implicit solution formulas and useful solution estimates. Finally, we show that the age-structured chemostat model gives a well-defined control system on a metric space.

Abstract: An inexact semismooth Newton method has been proposed for solving semi-linear elliptic optimal control problems in this paper. This method incorporates the generalized minimal residual (GMRES) method, a type of Krylov subspace method, to solve the Newton equations and utilizes nonmonotonic line search to adjust the iteration step size. The original problem is reformulated into a nonlinear equation through variational inequality principles and discretized using a second-order finite difference scheme. By leveraging slanting differentiability, the algorithm constructs semismooth Newton directions and employs GMRES method to inexactly solve the Newton equations, significantly reducing computational overhead. A dynamic nonmonotonic line search strategy is introduced to adjust stepsizes adaptively, ensuring global convergence while overcoming local stagnation. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the algorithm achieves superlinear convergence near optimal solutions when the residual control parameter $η_k$ approaches to 0. Numerical experiments validate the method's accuracy and efficiency in solving semilinear elliptic optimal control problems, corroborating theoretical insights.

Abstract: This paper investigates the problems large-scale distributed composite convex optimization, with motivations from a broad range of applications, including multi-agent systems, federated learning, smart grids, wireless sensor networks, compressed sensing, and so on. Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants are commonly employed to solve such problems. However, existing algorithms often rely on vanishing step sizes, strong convexity assumptions, or entail substantial computational overhead to ensure convergence or obtain favorable complexity. To bridge the gap between theory and practice, we integrate consensus optimization and operator splitting techniques (see Problem Reformulation) to develop a novel stochastic splitting algorithm, termed the \emph{stochastic distributed regularized splitting method} (S-D-RSM). In practice, S-D-RSM performs parallel updates of proximal mappings and gradient information for only a randomly selected subset of agents at each iteration. By introducing regularization terms, it effectively mitigates consensus discrepancies among distributed nodes. In contrast to conventional stochastic methods, our theoretical analysis establishes that S-D-RSM achieves global convergence without requiring diminishing step sizes or strong convexity assumptions. Furthermore, it achieves an iteration complexity of $\mathcal{O}(1/ε)$ with respect to both the objective function value and the consensus error. Numerical experiments show that S-D-RSM achieves up to 2--3$\times$ speedup compared to state-of-the-art baselines, while maintaining comparable or better accuracy. These results not only validate the algorithm's theoretical guarantees but also demonstrate its effectiveness in practical tasks such as compressed sensing and empirical risk minimization.

Conclusion: 算法在实际应用中表现出两阶段收敛行为：初始的O(1/k²)瞬态收敛和渐近线性收敛，验证了所提平滑规则的有效性。

Abstract: We propose an adaptive accelerated smoothing technique for a nonsmooth convex optimization problem where the smoothing update rule is coupled with the momentum parameter. We also extend the setting to the case where the objective function is the sum of two nonsmooth functions. With regard to convergence rate, we provide the global (optimal) sublinear convergence guarantees of O(1/k), which is known to be provably optimal for the studied class of functions, along with a local linear rate if the nonsmooth term fulfills a so-call locally strong convexity condition. We validate the performance of our algorithm on several problem classes, including regression with the l1-norm (the Lasso problem), sparse semidefinite programming (the MaxCut problem), Nuclear norm minimization with application in model free fault diagnosis, and l_1-regularized model predictive control to showcase the benefits of the coupling. An interesting observation is that although our global convergence result guarantees O(1/k) convergence, we consistently observe a practical transient convergence rate of O(1/k^2), followed by asymptotic linear convergence as anticipated by the theoretical result. This two-phase behavior can also be explained in view of the proposed smoothing rule.

Conclusion: 该分析为加速不精确邻近算法及其增广拉格朗日扩展提供了统一的理论基础。

Abstract: This paper investigates a Halpern acceleration of the inexact proximal point method for solving maximal monotone inclusion problems in Hilbert spaces. The proposed Halpern inexact proximal point method (HiPPM) is shown to be globally convergent, and a unified framework is developed to analyze its worst-case convergence rate. Under mild summability conditions on the inexactness tolerances, HiPPM achieves an $\mathcal{O}(1/k^{2})$ rate in terms of the squared fixed-point residual. Furthermore, under additional mild condition, the method retains a fast linear convergence rate. Building upon this framework, we further extend the acceleration technique to constrained convex optimization through the augmented Lagrangian formulation. In analogy to Rockafellar's classical results, the resulting accelerated inexact augmented Lagrangian method inherits the convergence rate and complexity guarantees of HiPPM. The analysis thus provides a unified theoretical foundation for accelerated inexact proximal algorithms and their augmented Lagrangian extensions.

Abstract: This paper addresses the generalized descent algorithm (DEAL) for minimizing smooth functions, which is analyzed under the Kurdyka-Łojasiewicz (KL) inequality. In particular, the suggested algorithm guarantees a sufficient decrease by adapting to the cost function's geometry. We leverage the KL property to establish the global convergence, convergence rates, and complexity. A particular focus is placed on the linear convergence of generalized descent methods. We show that the constant step-size and Armijo line search strategies along a generalized descent direction satisfy our generalized descent condition. Additionally, for nonsmooth functions by leveraging the smoothing techniques such as forward-backward and high-order Moreau envelopes, we show that the boosted proximal gradient method (BPGA) and the boosted high-order proximal-point (BPPA) methods are also specific cases of DEAL, respectively. It is notable that if the order of the high-order proximal term is chosen in a certain way (depending on the KL exponent), then the sequence generated by BPPA converges linearly for an arbitrary KL exponent. Our preliminary numerical experiments on inverse problems and LASSO demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed methods, validating our theoretical findings.

Abstract: This paper studies the fundamental properties of the high-order forward-backward splitting mapping (HiFBS) and its associated forward-backward envelope (HiFBE) through the lens of high-order regularization for nonconvex composite functions. Specifically, we (i) establish the boundedness and uniform boundedness of HiFBS, along with the Hölder and Lipschitz continuity of HiFBE; (ii) derive an explicit form for the subdifferentials of HiFBE; and (iii) investigate necessary and sufficient conditions for the differentiability and weak smoothness of HiFBE under suitable assumptions. By leveraging the prox-regularity of $g$ and the concept of $p$-calmness, we further demonstrate the local single-valuedness and continuity of HiFBS, which in turn guarantee the differentiability of HiFBE in neighborhoods of calm points. This paves the way for the development of gradient-based algorithms tailored to nonconvex composite optimization problems.

Furthermore, under local strong convexity and the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz (KL) inequality, we establish linear convergence rates and provide explicit complexity bounds. In particular, we show that when the gradient is locally Lipschitz continuous, SGA attains linear convergence for any KL exponent. We then introduce and analyze an adaptive variant of SGA (AdaSGA), which automatically adjusts the scaling and step-size parameters. For this method, we show global convergence, and derive local linear rates under strong convexity.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 管式最优控制问题通过预测轨迹管来捕捉预测不确定性，但约束收紧所需的backoff项会显著影响性能。优化用于预测管的反馈律可以显著减少backoff，但在线计算具有挑战性。

Method: 算法交替求解两个子问题：(i)固定backoff的名义最优控制问题；(ii)固定名义轨迹的无约束管优化问题，优化反馈增益。对于管优化，提出了基于名义轨迹与约束接近度的成本函数设计。

Result: 对于线性状态反馈下的椭球管，该分解将计算复杂度从O(n_x^6)显著降低到O(n_x^3)，即名义最优控制问题的复杂度。提供了CasADi原型版本和集成到acados求解器的高性能实现。

Conclusion: Riccati-ZORO算法能够有效处理管式最优控制问题，通过联合优化名义轨迹和不确定性管，在显著降低计算复杂度的同时提高性能。

Abstract: We present Riccati-ZORO, an algorithm for tube-based optimal control problems (OCP). Tube OCPs predict a tube of trajectories in order to capture predictive uncertainty. The tube induces a constraint tightening via additional backoff terms. This backoff can significantly affect the performance, and thus implicitly defines a cost of uncertainty. Optimizing the feedback law used to predict the tube can significantly reduce the backoffs, but its online computation is challenging.
  Riccati-ZORO jointly optimizes the nominal trajectory and uncertainty tube based on a heuristic uncertainty cost design. The algorithm alternates between two subproblems: (i) a nominal OCP with fixed backoffs, (ii) an unconstrained tube OCP, which optimizes the feedback gains for a fixed nominal trajectory. For the tube optimization, we propose a cost function informed by the proximity of the nominal trajectory to constraints, prioritizing reduction of the corresponding backoffs. These ideas are developed in detail for ellipsoidal tubes under linear state feedback. In this case, the decomposition into the two subproblems yields a substantial reduction of the computational complexity with respect to the state dimension from $\mathcal{O}(n_x^6)$ to $\mathcal{O}(n_x^3)$, i.e., the complexity of a nominal OCP.
  We investigate the algorithm in numerical experiments, and provide two open-source implementations: a prototyping version in CasADi and a high-performance implementation integrated into the acados OCP solver.

Abstract: This work introduces a novel dissimilarity measure between two convex cones, based on the max-min angle between them. We demonstrate that this measure is closely related to the Pompeiu-Hausdorff distance, a well-established metric for comparing compact sets. Furthermore, we examine cone configurations where the measure admits simplified or analytic forms. For the specific case of polyhedral cones, a nonconvex cutting-plane method is deployed to compute, at least approximately, the measure between them. Our approach builds on a tailored version of Kelley's cutting-plane algorithm, which involves solving a challenging master program per iteration. When this master program is solved locally, our method yields an angle that satisfies certain necessary optimality conditions of the underlying nonconvex optimization problem yielding the dissimilarity measure between the cones. As an application of the proposed mathematical and algorithmic framework, we address the image-set classification task under limited data conditions, a task that falls within the scope of the \emph{Few-Shot Learning} paradigm. In this context, image sets belonging to the same class are modeled as polyhedral cones, and our dissimilarity measure proves useful for understanding whether two image sets belong to the same class.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的低差异点集构建方法基于优化和机器学习技术，但计算成本高昂，需要数天计算或GPU集群。需要更高效、易用的方法。

Method: 使用梯度下降技术，从相对均匀的初始点集开始优化，可作为后处理应用于任何低差异点集生成方法

Conclusion: 简单的梯度下降方法能够高效地优化低差异点集，可作为现有方法的有效后处理步骤

Abstract: The construction of low-discrepancy sets, used for uniform sampling and numerical integration, has recently seen great improvements based on optimization and machine learning techniques. However, these methods are computationally expensive, often requiring days of computation or access to GPU clusters. We show that simple gradient descent-based techniques allow for comparable results when starting with a reasonably uniform point set. Not only is this method much more efficient and accessible, but it can be applied as post-processing to any low-discrepancy set generation method for a variety of standard discrepancy measures.

Abstract: We develop a new framework for branched transport between probability measures which are allowed to vary in time. This framework can be used to model problems where the underlying transportation network displays a branched structure, but the source and target mass distributions can change cyclically over time, such as road networks or circulatory systems. We introduce the notion of time-dependent transport paths along with associated energies and distances, and prove existence of transport paths whose energy achieves the distance. We also show the time-dependent transport yields a metric structure on subsets of appropriately defined measure-valued Sobolev spaces.
