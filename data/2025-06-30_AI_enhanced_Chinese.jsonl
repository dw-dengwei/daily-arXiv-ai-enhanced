It is widely recognized that achieving\nhuman-like efficiency and robustness manipulation requires the robotic brain to\nintegrate a comprehensive set of functions, such as task planning, policy\ngeneration, anomaly monitoring and handling, and long-term memory, achieving\nhigh-efficiency operation across all functions. Vision-Language Models (VLMs),\npretrained on massive multimodal data, have acquired rich world knowledge,\nexhibiting exceptional scene understanding and multimodal reasoning\ncapabilities. However, existing methods typically focus on realizing only a\nsingle function or a subset of functions within the robotic brain, without\nintegrating them into a unified cognitive architecture. Inspired by a\ndivide-and-conquer strategy and the architecture of the human brain, we propose\nFrankenBot, a VLM-driven, brain-morphic robotic manipulation framework that\nachieves both comprehensive functionality and high operational efficiency. Our\nframework includes a suite of components, decoupling a part of key functions\nfrom frequent VLM calls, striking an optimal balance between functional\ncompleteness and system efficiency. Specifically, we map task planning, policy\ngeneration, memory management, and low-level interfacing to the cortex,\ncerebellum, temporal lobe-hippocampus complex, and brainstem, respectively, and\ndesign efficient coordination mechanisms for the modules.

However, its application in surface path planning for mobile\nrobots remains largely unexplored. In this letter, a surface optimal path\nplanning algorithm called RM-Dijkstra is proposed, which is based on Riemannian\nmetric model. By constructing a new Riemannian metric on the 2D projection\nplane, the surface optimal path planning problem is therefore transformed into\na geometric problem on the 2D plane with new Riemannian metric. Induced by the\nstandard Euclidean metric on surface, the constructed new metric reflects\nenvironmental information of the robot and ensures that the projection map is\nan isometric immersion. By conducting a series of simulation tests, the\nexperimental results demonstrate that the RM-Dijkstra algorithm not only\neffectively solves the optimal path planning problem on surfaces, but also\noutperforms traditional path planning algorithms in terms of path accuracy and\nsmoothness, particularly in complex scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u9ece\u66fc\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684RM-Dijkstra\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8868\u9762\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "Dijkstra\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u79bb\u6563\u56fe\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8868\u9762\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u8f83\u5c11\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u65b0\u7684\u9ece\u66fc\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u5c06\u8868\u9762\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a2D\u5e73\u9762\u4e0a\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u786e\u4fdd\u6295\u5f71\u6620\u5c04\u4e3a\u7b49\u8ddd\u6d78\u5165\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8868\u660e\uff0cRM-Dijkstra\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u8def\u5f84\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u5e73\u6ed1\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u3002", "conclusion": "RM-Dijkstra\u7b97\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8868\u9762\u6700\u4f18\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Integrating cover crops (CC) offers multiple benefits, including soil\nerosion reduction, weed suppression, decreased nitrogen requirements, and\nenhanced carbon sequestration, all of which are closely tied to the aboveground\nbiomass (AGB) they produce. However, biomass production varies significantly\ndue to microsite variability, making accurate estimation and mapping essential\nfor identifying zones of poor weed suppression and optimizing targeted\nmanagement strategies. To address this challenge, developing a comprehensive CC\nmap, including its AGB distribution, will enable informed decision-making\nregarding weed control methods and optimal application rates. Manual visual\ninspection is impractical and labor-intensive, especially given the extensive\nfield size and the wide diversity and variation of weed species and sizes. In\nthis context, optical imagery and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data are\ntwo prominent sources with unique characteristics that enhance AGB estimation.\nThis study introduces a ground robot-mounted multimodal sensor system designed\nfor agricultural field mapping. The system integrates optical and LiDAR data,\nleveraging machine learning (ML) methods for data fusion to improve biomass\npredictions. The best ML-based model for dry AGB estimation achieved a\ncoefficient of determination value of 0.88, demonstrating robust performance in\ndiverse field conditions.
