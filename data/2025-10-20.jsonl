Using data from the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men\nStudy (MrOS), the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF), and the UK Biobank,\nStage 1 (Screening) employs clinical, demographic, and functional variables to\nestimate baseline risk, while Stage 2 (Imaging) incorporates DXA-derived\nfeatures for refinement. The model was rigorously validated through internal\nand external testing, showing consistent performance and adaptability across\ncohorts. Compared to T-score and FRAX, the two-stage framework achieved higher\nsensitivity and reduced missed cases, offering a cost-effective and\npersonalized approach for early hip fracture risk assessment.\n  Keywords: Hip Fracture, Two-Stage Model, Risk Prediction, Sensitivity, DXA,\nFRAX"}

However, both approaches often assume uniform annotator\npreferences and rely on binary comparisons, overlooking two key limitations:\nthe diversity of human evaluators and the limitations of pairwise feedback. In\nthis work, we address both these issues.

To\nevaluate this dimension, we introduce ReasonIF, a systematic benchmark for\nassessing reasoning instruction following. ReasonIF includes six categories of\ninstruction prompts, spanning multilingual reasoning, formatting and length\ncontrol. Across many open-source LRMs including GPT-OSS, Qwen3, and\nDeepSeek-R1, we find substantial failures in reasoning instruction adherence:\nthe highest instruction following score (IFS) remains below 0.25, meaning that\nfewer than $25\\%$ of reasoning traces comply with the given instructions.\nNotably, as task difficulty increases, reasoning instruction following degrades\nfurther.

This raises a fundamental\nquestion: what microscopic property of pre-trained models leads to this\nvariation? To investigate, we formalize reasoning as chains of Horn clauses\n(\"if-then\" rules) built from features extracted from the LLM's latent space via\ncross-layer sparse autoencoders (SAEs). We estimate the transition\nprobabilities between its features, and further categorize each rule by its\nsemantic soundness level (e.g., strict, plausible, noisy) with an LLM. Our key\ndiscovery is that high-potential models are inherently soundness-aware: their\ninternal probability distributions systematically shift across rules' soundness\nlevels, becoming highly distinct for \"strict\" versus \"noisy\" rules. In\ncontrast, weaker models are soundness-agnostic, collapsing to one distribution\nregardless of soundness levels. To quantify this, we introduce the\nSoundness-Aware Level (SAL), a microscopic metric using the Jensen-Shannon\nDivergence to measure the separation between these distributions. We show that\nSAL's predictions of post-RLVR reasoning performance follow a precise empirical\nlaw (R^2=0.87) across diverse model families (Qwen, Mistral, Llama, DeepSeek)\nand scales (0.5B-14B). This reveals that a model's reasoning potential is tied\nto its intrinsic, pre-trained ability to distinguish sound knowledge from\nunsound ones.

Specifically, an f-divergence ball defines an ambiguity set\naround the evaluation distribution, and a robust acquisition rule maximizes\nworst-case expected utility while retaining the query efficiency of Bayesian\nsearch. Therefore, the search explicitly targets reliability under distribution\nshift rather than average behavior alone. Experiments follow the\ninstruction-induction protocol with matched query budgets across formality\nrewriting, code debugging, and translation. For example, on BIG-Bench\ninformative-to-formal rewriting, accuracy improves from 61.3 +/- 0.7% to\napproximately 85-90%, yielding an absolute gain of about 25-30 points.\nMoreover, auto-debugging shows about +25-point gains under domain shift.\nMeanwhile, stable tasks such as cause-and-effect remain above 96%, indicating\nno loss on in-distribution cases.

The\nfirst part of the thesis develops theory and algorithms for safe deployment in\nranking systems. An exposure-based generalisation bound is derived, leading to\na counterfactual risk-minimisation objective whose solution is guaranteed not\nto underperform the logging policy, even with sparse feedback. This guarantee\nis extended to doubly robust estimators, enabling safety even under adversarial\nor misspecified user models and offering practitioners explicit control over\npermissible utility loss. The second part turns to single-action bandits, where\nvarious off-policy estimators are unified within a baseline-correction\nframework. A closed-form optimal baseline is proposed and shown to minimise\nboth evaluation and policy-gradient variance, thereby improving off-policy\nlearning reliability.

Keywords: global\n  optimisation, dimensionality reduction techniques, Bayesian methods,\n  Variational Autoencoders", "summary": "Bayesian optimisation (BO) is a standard approach for sample-efficient global\noptimisation of expensive black-box functions, yet its scalability to high\ndimensions remains challenging. Here, we investigate nonlinear dimensionality\nreduction techniques that reduce the problem to a sequence of low-dimensional\nLatent-Space BO (LSBO). While early LSBO methods used (linear) random\nprojections (Wang et al., 2013), building on Grosnit et al. (2021), we employ\nVariational Autoencoders (VAEs) for LSBO, focusing on deep metric loss for\nstructured latent manifolds and VAE retraining to adapt the encoder-decoder to\nnewly sampled regions. We propose some changes in their implementation,\noriginally designed for tasks such as molecule generation, and reformulate the\nalgorithm for broader optimisation purposes. We then couple LSBO with\nSequential Domain Reduction (SDR) directly in the latent space (SDR-LSBO),\nyielding an algorithm that narrows the latent search domains as evidence\naccumulates. Implemented in a GPU-accelerated BoTorch stack with Matern-5/2\nGaussian process surrogates, our numerical results show improved optimisation\nquality across benchmark tasks and that structured latent manifolds improve BO\nperformance. Additionally, we compare random embeddings and VAEs as two\nmechanisms for dimensionality reduction, showing that the latter outperforms\nthe former. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to combine\nSDR with VAE-based LSBO, and our analysis clarifies design choices for metric\nshaping and retraining that are critical for scalable latent space BO.

Conventional\napproaches often struggle to capture complex multimodal signal relationships,\nare constrained to unimodal data or single fault types, and exhibit performance\ndegradation under noisy or cross-domain conditions. This paper proposes the\nMultimodal Hypergraph Contrastive Attention Network (MM-HCAN), a unified\nframework for robust fault diagnosis. To the best of our knowledge, MM-HCAN is\nthe first to integrate contrastive learning within a hypergraph topology\nspecifically designed for multimodal sensor fusion, enabling the joint\nmodelling of intra- and inter-modal dependencies and enhancing generalisation\nbeyond Euclidean embedding spaces. The model facilitates simultaneous diagnosis\nof bearing, stator, and rotor faults, addressing the engineering need for\nconsolidated di- agnostic capabilities. Evaluated on three real-world\nbenchmarks, MM-HCAN achieves up to 99.82% accuracy with strong cross-domain\ngeneralisation and resilience to noise, demonstrating its suitability for\nreal-world deployment. An ablation study validates the contribution of each\ncomponent. MM-HCAN provides a scalable and robust solution for comprehensive\nmulti-fault diagnosis, supporting predictive maintenance and extended asset\nlongevity in industrial environments."}

Code: https://github.com/ltjed/freephdlabor", "summary": "The automation of scientific discovery represents a critical milestone in\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) research. However, existing agentic systems for\nscience suffer from two fundamental limitations: rigid, pre-programmed\nworkflows that cannot adapt to intermediate findings, and inadequate context\nmanagement that hinders long-horizon research. We present\n\\texttt{freephdlabor}, an open-source multiagent framework featuring\n\\textit{fully dynamic workflows} determined by real-time agent reasoning and a\n\\coloremph{\\textit{modular architecture}} enabling seamless customization --\nusers can modify, add, or remove agents to address domain-specific\nrequirements. The framework provides comprehensive infrastructure including\n\\textit{automatic context compaction}, \\textit{workspace-based communication}\nto prevent information degradation, \\textit{memory persistence} across\nsessions, and \\textit{non-blocking human intervention} mechanisms. These\nfeatures collectively transform automated research from isolated, single-run\nattempts into \\textit{continual research programs} that build systematically on\nprior explorations and incorporate human feedback. By providing both the\narchitectural principles and practical implementation for building customizable\nco-scientist systems, this work aims to facilitate broader adoption of\nautomated research across scientific domains, enabling practitioners to deploy\ninteractive multiagent systems that autonomously conduct end-to-end research --\nfrom ideation through experimentation to publication-ready manuscripts."}

This abstraction\ncaptures realistic delays and inexact Hessian updates while avoiding the manual\ntuning required by Lazy Hessian methods. Focusing on cubic regularization, we\nshow that our approach retains strong convergence guarantees and achieves a\nprovable wall-clock speedup of order $\\sqrt{\\tau}$, where $\\tau$ is the\nrelative time needed to compute and decompose the Hessian compared to a\ngradient step. Since $\\tau$ can be orders of magnitude larger than one in\nhigh-dimensional problems, this improvement is practically significant.\nExperiments on synthetic and real datasets confirm the theory: asynchronous\ncurvature consistently outperforms vanilla and Lazy Hessian baselines, while\nmaintaining second-order accuracy."}
