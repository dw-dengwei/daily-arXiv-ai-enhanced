This survey\npresents the first holistic analysis of LLM-empowered software engineering,\nbridging the critical gap between evaluation and solution approaches. We\nanalyze 150+ recent papers and organize them into a comprehensive taxonomy\nspanning two major dimensions: (1) Solutions, categorized into prompt-based,\nfine-tuning-based, and agent-based paradigms, and (2) Benchmarks, covering code\ngeneration, translation, repair, and other tasks. Our analysis reveals how the\nfield has evolved from simple prompt engineering to complex agentic systems\nincorporating planning and decomposition, reasoning and self-refinement, memory\nmechanisms, and tool augmentation. We present a unified pipeline that\nillustrates the complete workflow from task specification to final\ndeliverables, demonstrating how different solution paradigms address varying\ncomplexity levels across software engineering tasks. Unlike existing surveys\nthat focus on isolated aspects, we provide full-spectrum coverage connecting\n50+ benchmarks with their corresponding solution strategies, enabling\nresearchers to identify optimal approaches for specific evaluation criteria.\nFurthermore, we identify critical research gaps and propose actionable future\ndirections, including multi-agent collaboration frameworks, self-evolving code\ngeneration systems, and integration of formal verification with LLM-based\nmethods.

However, large-scale and fine-grained mobility data\nremains difficult to obtain due to privacy concerns and collection costs,\nmaking it essential to simulate realistic mobility and traffic patterns. User\ntrajectories and mobile traffic are fundamentally coupled, reflecting both\nphysical mobility and cyber behavior in urban environments. Despite this strong\ninterdependence, existing studies often model them separately, limiting the\nability to capture cross-modal dynamics. Therefore, a unified framework is\ncrucial. In this paper, we propose MSTDiff, a Multi-Scale Diffusion Transformer\nfor joint simulation of mobile traffic and user trajectories. First, MSTDiff\napplies discrete wavelet transforms for multi-resolution traffic decomposition.\nSecond, it uses a hybrid denoising network to process continuous traffic\nvolumes and discrete location sequences. A transition mechanism based on urban\nknowledge graph embedding similarity is designed to guide semantically informed\ntrajectory generation.

Compared to rule-based translation which produces Rust code that\nremains largely unsafe, LLM-based methods can generate more idiomatic and safer\nRust code because LLMs have been trained on vast amount of human-written\nidiomatic code. Although promising, existing LLM-based methods still struggle\nwith project-level C-to-Rust translation. They typically partition a C project\ninto smaller units (\\eg{} functions) based on call graphs and translate them\nbottom-up to resolve program dependencies. However, this bottom-up,\nunit-by-unit paradigm often fails to translate pointers due to the lack of a\nglobal perspective on their usage. To address this problem, we propose a novel\nC-Rust Pointer Knowledge Graph (KG) that enriches a code-dependency graph with\ntwo types of pointer semantics: (i) pointer-usage information which record\nglobal behaviors such as points-to flows and map lower-level struct usage to\nhigher-level units; and (ii) Rust-oriented annotations which encode ownership,\nmutability, nullability, and lifetime. Synthesizing the \\kg{} with LLMs, we\nfurther propose \\ourtool{}, which implements a project-level C-to-Rust\ntranslation technique. In \\ourtool{}, the \\kg{} provides LLMs with\ncomprehensive pointer semantics from a global perspective, thus guiding LLMs\ntowards generating safe and idiomatic Rust code from a given C project. Our\nexperiments show that \\ourtool{} reduces unsafe usages in translated Rust by\n99.9\\% compared to both rule-based translation and traditional LLM-based\nrewriting, while achieving an average 29.3\\% higher functional correctness than\nthose fuzzing-enhanced LLM methods."}

However, this advancement also\npresents significant security challenges, as LLM-generated code often contains\nvulnerabilities. One direction of research strengthens LLMs by injecting or\nrefining security knowledge through curated datasets, model tuning, or static\nanalyzers. While effective in certain settings, these methods can be\nresource-intensive, less adaptable to zero-day vulnerabilities, and often\ninapplicable to proprietary models. To address these challenges, we introduce\nGRASP, which explores a new direction that focuses on structured reasoning over\nSecure Coding Practices(SCPs) rather than additional training or external\nfeedback. GRASP comprises two key ideas: (1) an SCP graph that organizes SCPs\ninto a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) capturing dependencies and relationships,\nand (2) a graph-based reasoning process that systematically guides LLMs through\nrelevant SCPs for code generation. This design enables interpretable,\nmodel-agnostic, and scalable security improvements, particularly for previously\nunseen vulnerabilities. Our evaluation shows that GRASP consistently achieves\nSecurity Rates (SR) exceeding 80% across multiple LLMs, and delivers up to 88%\nimprovements over baselines on zero-day vulnerabilities."}

While Decentralized Identity (DID) and\nVerifiable Credentials (VCs) provide a standardized framework for user data\nsovereignty, achieving trusted identity verification and data sharing without\ncompromising privacy remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a\nnovel, comprehensive framework that integrates DIDs and VCs with efficient\nZero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) schemes to address this core issue. The key\ncontributions of this framework are threefold: first, it constructs a set of\nstrong privacy-preserving protocols based on zk-STARKs, allowing users to prove\nthat their credentials satisfy specific conditions (e.g., \"age is over 18\")\nwithout revealing any underlying sensitive data. Second, it designs a scalable,\nprivacy-preserving credential revocation mechanism based on cryptographic\naccumulators, effectively solving credential management challenges in\nlarge-scale scenarios. Finally, it integrates a practical social key recovery\nscheme, significantly enhancing system usability and security. Through a\nprototype implementation and performance evaluation, this paper quantitatively\nanalyzes the framework's performance in terms of proof generation time,\nverification overhead, and on-chain costs. Compared to existing\nstate-of-the-art systems based on zk-SNARKs, our framework, at the cost of a\nlarger proof size, significantly improves prover efficiency for complex\ncomputations and provides stronger security guarantees, including no trusted\nsetup and post-quantum security. Finally, a case study in the decentralized\nfinance (DeFi) credit scoring scenario demonstrates the framework's immense\npotential for unlocking capital efficiency and fostering a trusted data\neconomy."}

It achieves 95.8% accuracy on\nfive-class attribution, 94.6% on ten-class, and 88.5% on twenty-class tasks,\nsurpassing other tested models such as BERT, CodeBERT, and Longformer. We\ndemonstrate that classifiers capture deeper stylistic regularities in program\ndataflow and structure, rather than relying on surface-level features. As a\nresult, attribution remains effective even after mangling, comment removal, and\nheavy code transformations. To support open science and reproducibility, we\nrelease the LLM-NodeJS dataset, Google Colab training scripts, and all related\nmaterials on GitHub: https://github.com/LLM-NodeJS-dataset."}

A backdoored VLA agent can be covertly\ntriggered by a pre-injected backdoor to execute adversarial actions,\npotentially causing system failures or even physical harm. Although backdoor\nattacks on VLA models have been explored, prior work has focused only on\nuntargeted attacks, leaving the more practically threatening scenario of\ntargeted manipulation unexamined. In this paper, we study targeted backdoor\nattacks on VLA models and introduce TabVLA, a novel framework that enables such\nattacks via black-box fine-tuning. TabVLA explores two deployment-relevant\ninference-time threat models: input-stream editing and in-scene triggering.

This paper introduces an\nadvanced security framework that extends the Task-Based Access Control (TBAC)\nmodel by using a Large Language Model (LLM) as an autonomous, risk-aware judge.\nThis model makes access control decisions not only based on an agent's intent\nbut also by explicitly considering the inherent \\textbf{risk associated with\ntarget resources} and the LLM's own \\textbf{model uncertainty} in its\ndecision-making process. When an agent proposes a novel task, the LLM judge\nsynthesizes a just-in-time policy while also computing a composite risk score\nfor the task and an uncertainty estimate for its own reasoning. High-risk or\nhigh-uncertainty requests trigger more stringent controls, such as requiring\nhuman approval. This dual consideration of external risk and internal\nconfidence allows the model to enforce a more robust and adaptive version of\nthe principle of least privilege, paving the way for safer and more trustworthy\nautonomous systems."}

By leveraging LRMs' reasoning ability, these guardrails help the\nmodels to assess the safety of user inputs before generating final responses.\nThe powerful reasoning ability can analyze the intention of the input query and\nwill refuse to assist once it detects the harmful intent hidden by the\njailbreak methods. Such guardrails have shown a significant boost in defense,\nsuch as the near-perfect refusal rates on the open-source gpt-oss series.\nUnfortunately, we find that these powerful reasoning-based guardrails can be\nextremely vulnerable to subtle manipulation of the input prompts, and once\nhijacked, can lead to even more harmful results. Specifically, we first uncover\na surprisingly fragile aspect of these guardrails: simply adding a few template\ntokens to the input prompt can successfully bypass the seemingly powerful\nguardrails and lead to explicit and harmful responses. To explore further, we\nintroduce a bag of jailbreak methods that subvert the reasoning-based\nguardrails. Our attacks span white-, gray-, and black-box settings and range\nfrom effortless template manipulations to fully automated optimization. Along\nwith the potential for scalable implementation, these methods also achieve\nalarmingly high attack success rates (e.g., exceeding 90% across 5 different\nbenchmarks on gpt-oss series on both local host models and online API\nservices). Evaluations across various leading open-source LRMs confirm that\nthese vulnerabilities are systemic, underscoring the urgent need for stronger\nalignment techniques for open-sourced LRMs to prevent malicious misuse.

Existing\nbenchmarks often lack real-world complexity and are thus unable to accurately\nassess LLMs' cybersecurity capabilities. To address this gap, we introduce\nPACEbench, a practical AI cyber-exploitation benchmark built on the principles\nof realistic vulnerability difficulty, environmental complexity, and cyber\ndefenses. Specifically, PACEbench comprises four scenarios spanning single,\nblended, chained, and defense vulnerability exploitations. To handle these\ncomplex challenges, we propose PACEagent, a novel agent that emulates human\npenetration testers by supporting multi-phase reconnaissance, analysis, and\nexploitation. Extensive experiments with seven frontier LLMs demonstrate that\ncurrent models struggle with complex cyber scenarios, and none can bypass\ndefenses. These findings suggest that current models do not yet pose a\ngeneralized cyber offense threat.
