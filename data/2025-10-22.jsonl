The improvement arises from stochastic difference\nlatent updates in TM, which preserve target covariance that deterministic FM\nunderestimates. We then characterize convergence rates, showing that TM\nachieves faster convergence than FM under a fixed compute budget, establishing\nits advantage in the unimodal Gaussian setting.

Across diverse open-source model families (Llama,\nGemma, Mistral, Qwen, DeepSeek, and gpt-oss), ADA achieves robust safety\nperformance without requiring any changes to the base model's parameters. It\nsecures a near-100% refusal rate against challenging adversarial prefill\nattacks ranging from dozens to thousands of tokens. Furthermore, ADA reduces\nthe average success rate of prominent adversarial prompt attacks (such as GCG,\nAutoDAN, PAIR, and TAP) to below 3%. This is all accomplished while preserving\nutility on benign tasks with minimal over-refusal. ADA maintains this\nresilience even after the base model undergoes subsequent instruction tuning\n(benign or adversarial)."}

A common practical approach is to\naugment the RL policy with a safety filter that overrides unsafe actions to\nprevent failures during both training and deployment. However, safety filtering\nis often perceived as sacrificing performance and hindering the learning\nprocess. We show that this perceived safety-performance tradeoff is not\ninherent and prove, for the first time, that enforcing safety with a\nsufficiently permissive safety filter does not degrade asymptotic performance.\nWe formalize RL safety with a safety-critical Markov decision process (SC-MDP),\nwhich requires categorical, rather than high-probability, avoidance of\ncatastrophic failure states. Additionally, we define an associated filtered MDP\nin which all actions result in safe effects, thanks to a safety filter that is\nconsidered to be a part of the environment. Our main theorem establishes that\n(i) learning in the filtered MDP is safe categorically, (ii) standard RL\nconvergence carries over to the filtered MDP, and (iii) any policy that is\noptimal in the filtered MDP-when executed through the same filter-achieves the\nsame asymptotic return as the best safe policy in the SC-MDP, yielding a\ncomplete separation between safety enforcement and performance optimization.

While the majority of related work on\nmemorisation has focused on measuring success of training data extraction\nthrough string matching, we argue that embedding models are better suited for\nour specific goals. Distances measured through a high quality embedding model\ncan identify semantic similarities between strings that a different metric such\nas edit distance will struggle to capture. In fact, in our investigation,\napproximate string matching would have severely undercounted (by a conservative\nestimate of $10\\times$) the amount of data that can be extracted due to trivial\nartifacts that deflate the metric. Interestingly, we find that models readily\nregurgitate training data that was used in post-training phases such as SFT or\nRL. We show that this data can be then used to train a base model, recovering a\nmeaningful amount of the original performance. We believe our work exposes a\npossibly overlooked risk towards extracting alignment data. Finally, our work\nopens up an interesting discussion on the downstream effects of distillation\npractices: since models seem to be regurgitating aspects of their training set,\ndistillation can therefore be thought of as indirectly training on the model's\noriginal dataset."}

In this paper, we investigate the problem of unsupervised\nopen-set graph domain adaptation, where the goal is to not only correctly\nclassify target nodes into the known classes, but also recognize previously\nunseen node types into the unknown class. Towards this end, we propose a novel\nframework called GraphRTA, which conducts reprogramming on both the graph and\nmodel sides. Specifically, we reprogram the graph by modifying target graph\nstructure and node features, which facilitates better separation of known and\nunknown classes. Meanwhile, we also perform model reprogramming by pruning\ndomain-specific parameters to reduce bias towards the source graph while\npreserving parameters that capture transferable patterns across graphs.\nAdditionally, we extend the classifier with an extra dimension for the unknown\nclass, thus eliminating the need of manually specified threshold in open-set\nrecognition. Comprehensive experiments on several public datasets demonstrate\nthat our proposed model can achieve satisfied performance compared with recent\nstate-of-the-art baselines.

This raises a fundamental question: Can the innate\nshallow alignment in LLMs be unlocked to ensure safety at arbitrary generation\ndepths? To achieve this goal, we propose Any-Depth Alignment (ADA), an\neffective inference-time defense with negligible overhead. ADA is built based\non our observation that alignment is concentrated in the assistant header\ntokens through repeated use in shallow-refusal training, and these tokens\npossess the model's strong alignment priors. By reintroducing these tokens\nmid-stream, ADA induces the model to reassess harmfulness and recover refusals\nat any point in generation. Across diverse open-source model families (Llama,\nGemma, Mistral, Qwen, DeepSeek, and gpt-oss), ADA achieves robust safety\nperformance without requiring any changes to the base model's parameters.

Therefore, we formulate crop\nyield as a function of temporal water scarcity and predict both the crop\ndrought stress and the sensitivity to water scarcity at fine-scale resolution.\nSequentially modeling the crop yield response to water enables accurate yield\nprediction. To enforce physical consistency, a novel physics-informed loss\nfunction is proposed. We leverage multispectral satellite imagery,\nmeteorological data, and fine-scale yield data. Further, to account for the\nuncertainty within the model, we build upon a deep ensemble approach. Our\nmethod surpasses state-of-the-art models like LSTM and Transformers in crop\nyield prediction with a coefficient of determination ($R^2$-score) of up to\n0.82 while offering high explainability. This method offers decision support\nfor industry, policymakers, and farmers in building a more resilient\nagriculture in times of changing climate conditions."}

To\nthis end, SB-SETM (i) leverages a truncated stick-breaking construction for the\ntopic-per-document distribution, enabling the model to automatically infer from\nthe data the appropriate number of active topics at each timestep; and (ii)\nintroduces a merging strategy for topic embeddings based on a continuous\nformulation of optimal transport adapted to the high dimensionality of the\nlatent topic space.

We conducted a comprehensive comparative evaluation of three\ntopic modelling approaches: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Structural Topic\nModelling (STM), and BERTopic. We also introduced a novel algorithm, named\nCOFFEE, designed to enable robust covariate effect estimation for BERTopic.\nThis advancement addresses a significant gap, as BERTopic lacks a native\nfunction for covariate analysis, unlike the probabilistic STM. Our findings\nhighlight that while all models effectively delineate core scientific domains,\nBERTopic outperformed by consistently identifying more granular, coherent, and\nemergent themes, such as the rapid expansion of artificial intelligence.\nAdditionally, the covariate analysis, powered by COFFEE, confirmed distinct\nprovincial research specializations and revealed consistent gender-based\nthematic patterns across various scientific disciplines. These insights offer a\nrobust empirical foundation for funding organizations to formulate more\nequitable and impactful funding strategies, thereby enhancing the effectiveness\nof the scientific ecosystem."}
