For this task, predictive accuracy alone is\ninsufficient; interpretability is equally essential for building clinical trust\nand meeting regulatory standards, a topic that has attracted significant\nattention in information system research. Accordingly, an ideal solution should\nenable intrinsic interpretability and align its reasoning with three key\nelements of the ICU decision-making practices: clinical course identification,\ndemographic heterogeneity, and prognostication awareness. However, conventional\napproaches largely focus on demographic heterogeneity, overlooking clinical\ncourse identification and prognostication awareness. Recent prototype learning\nmethods address clinical course identification, yet the integration of the\nother elements into such frameworks remains underexplored. To address these\ngaps, we propose ProtoDoctor, a novel ICU mortality prediction framework that\ndelivers intrinsic interpretability while integrating all three elements of the\nICU decision-making practices into its reasoning process. Methodologically,\nProtoDoctor features two key innovations: the Prognostic Clinical Course\nIdentification module and the Demographic Heterogeneity Recognition module. The\nformer enables the identification of clinical courses via prototype learning\nand achieves prognostication awareness using a novel regularization mechanism.\nThe latter models demographic heterogeneity through cohort-specific prototypes\nand risk adjustments.

Guided by this analysis, we\npropose a lightweight surrogate for meta-reweighting that integrates\nmean-centering, row shifting, and label-signed modulation, yielding more stable\nperformance while avoiding expensive bi-level optimization.

By supervising on single-action\ntrajectories, they fail to exploit agent-permutation symmetries, where distinct\nsequences of actions yield identical solutions, hindering generalization and\nthe ability to learn coordinated behavior.\n  We address these challenges by extending self-improvement to operate over\njoint multi-agent actions. Our model architecture predicts complete agent-task\nassignments jointly at each decision step. To explicitly leverage symmetries,\nwe employ a set-prediction loss, which supervises the policy on multiple expert\nassignments for any given state. This approach enhances sample efficiency and\nthe model's ability to learn coordinated behavior. Furthermore, by generating\nmulti-agent actions in parallel, it drastically accelerates the solution\ngeneration phase of the self-improvement loop. Empirically, we validate our\nmethod on several combinatorial problems, demonstrating consistent improvements\nin the quality of the final solution and a reduced generation latency compared\nto standard self-improvement."}

The literature\ntypically distinguishes between two settings: infinite inventory, where the\nfirm has unlimited stock and time to sell, and finite inventory, where both\ninventory and selling horizon are limited. In both cases, the central challenge\nlies in the fact that the demand function -- how sales respond to price -- is\nunknown and must be learned from data. Traditional approaches often assume a\nspecific parametric form for the demand function, enabling the use of\nreinforcement learning (RL) to identify near-optimal pricing strategies.\nHowever, such assumptions may not hold in real-world scenarios, limiting the\napplicability of these methods. In this work, we propose a Gaussian Process\n(GP) based nonparametric approach to dynamic pricing that avoids restrictive\nmodeling assumptions.

We study whether uniform edge\nsampling-a simple, structure-agnostic strategy-can suffice for spectral\nclustering. Our main result shows that for graphs admitting a well-separated\n$k$-clustering, characterized by a large structure ratio $\\Upsilon(k) =\n\\lambda_{k+1} / \\rho_G(k)$, uniform sampling preserves the spectral subspace\nused for clustering. Specifically, we prove that uniformly sampling $O(\\gamma^2\nn \\log n / \\epsilon^2)$ edges, where $\\gamma$ is the Laplacian condition\nnumber, yields a sparsifier whose top $(n-k)$-dimensional eigenspace is\napproximately orthogonal to the cluster indicators. This ensures that the\nspectral embedding remains faithful, and clustering quality is preserved. Our\nanalysis introduces new resistance bounds for intra-cluster edges, a\nrank-$(n-k)$ effective resistance formulation, and a matrix Chernoff bound\nadapted to the dominant eigenspace.

This limitation renders them oblivious to crucial\ninformation from diverse covariates in real-world forecasting tasks. To further\nenhance the performance of TSFMs, we propose a general covariate-aware\nadaptation (CoRA) framework for TSFMs. It leverages pre-trained backbones of\nfoundation models while effectively incorporating exogenous covariates from\nvarious modalities, including time series, language, and images, to improve the\nquality of predictions. Technically, CoRA maintains the equivalence of\ninitialization and parameter consistency during adaptation. With preserved\nbackbones of foundation models as frozen feature extractors, the outcome\nembeddings from foundation models are empirically demonstrated more informative\nthan raw data. Further, CoRA employs a novel Granger Causality Embedding (GCE)\nto automatically evaluate covariates regarding their causal predictability with\nrespect to the target variate. We incorporate these weighted embeddings with a\nzero-initialized condition-injection mechanism, avoiding catastrophic\nforgetting of pre-trained foundation models and gradually integrates exogenous\ninformation.

We then show\nthat scaling model size can lead to behaviors that, while improving accuracy on\nbenchmarks, fail any reasonable test of intelligence, let alone\nsuper-intelligence: In the limit of infinite space and time, large models can\nbehave as savants, able to brute-force through any task without any insight.\nInstead, we argue that the key quantity to optimize when scaling reasoning\nmodels is time, whose critical role in learning has so far only been indirectly\nconsidered."}

Prior work has focused on\nlargely deterministic environments with abundant interaction data, simple\nmechanics, and human guidance. We address a more realistic and challenging\nsetting, learning in a complex, stochastic environment where the agent has only\n\"one life\" to explore a hostile environment without human guidance. We\nintroduce OneLife, a framework that models world dynamics through\nconditionally-activated programmatic laws within a probabilistic programming\nframework. Each law operates through a precondition-effect structure,\nactivating in relevant world states. This creates a dynamic computation graph\nthat routes inference and optimization only through relevant laws, avoiding\nscaling challenges when all laws contribute to predictions about a complex,\nhierarchical state, and enabling the learning of stochastic dynamics even with\nsparse rule activation. To evaluate our approach under these demanding\nconstraints, we introduce a new evaluation protocol that measures (a) state\nranking, the ability to distinguish plausible future states from implausible\nones, and (b) state fidelity, the ability to generate future states that\nclosely resemble reality. We develop and evaluate our framework on Crafter-OO,\nour reimplementation of the Crafter environment that exposes a structured,\nobject-oriented symbolic state and a pure transition function that operates on\nthat state alone. OneLife can successfully learn key environment dynamics from\nminimal, unguided interaction, outperforming a strong baseline on 16 out of 23\nscenarios tested. We also test OneLife's planning ability, with simulated\nrollouts successfully identifying superior strategies. Our work establishes a\nfoundation for autonomously constructing programmatic world models of unknown,\ncomplex environments."}

Current LLM alignment methods,\nhowever, typically provide only directional or open-ended guidance, failing to\nreliably achieve exact attribute intensities. We address this limitation with\nthree key designs: (1) reformulating precise attribute intensity control as a\ntarget-reaching problem, rather than simple maximization; (2) training a\nlightweight value function via temporal-difference learning to predict final\nattribute intensity scores from partial generations, thereby steering LLM\noutputs; and (3) employing gradient-based interventions on hidden\nrepresentations to navigate the model precisely towards specific attribute\nintensity targets. Our method enables fine-grained, continuous control over\nattribute intensities, moving beyond simple directional alignment. Experiments\non LLaMA-3.2-3b and Phi-4-mini confirm our method's ability to steer text\ngeneration to user-specified attribute intensities with high accuracy. Finally,\nwe demonstrate efficiency enhancements across three downstream tasks:\npreference data synthesis, Pareto frontier approximation and optimization, and\ndistillation of aligned behaviors for intervention-free inference.

In this paper, we introduce a novel\nGradient-Guided Diffusion-based Optimization framework, termed GGDOpt, which\ntackles CCP through three key innovations. First, GGDOpt accommodates a broad\nclass of CCP problems without requiring the knowledge of the exact distribution\nof uncertainty-relying solely on a set of samples. Second, to address the\nnonconvexity of the chance constraints, it reformulates the CCP as a sampling\nproblem over the product of two distributions: an unknown data distribution\nsupported on a nonconvex set and a Boltzmann distribution defined by the\nobjective function, which fully leverages both first- and second-order gradient\ninformation. Third, GGDOpt has theoretical convergence guarantees and provides\npractical error bounds under mild assumptions. By progressively injecting noise\nduring the forward diffusion process to convexify the nonconvex feasible\nregion, GGDOpt enables guided reverse sampling to generate asymptotically\noptimal solutions. Experimental results on synthetic datasets and a waveform\ndesign task in wireless communications demonstrate that GGDOpt outperforms\nexisting methods in both solution quality and stability with nearly 80%\noverhead reduction."}

Libraries like PyTorch and TensorFlow provide automatic\ndifferentiation and efficient GPU implementation, but are additions to Python,\nwhich was never intended for AI. Their lack of support for automated reasoning\nand knowledge acquisition has led to a long and costly series of hacky attempts\nto tack them on. On the other hand, AI languages like LISP an Prolog lack\nscalability and support for learning. This paper proposes tensor logic, a\nlanguage that solves these problems by unifying neural and symbolic AI at a\nfundamental level. The sole construct in tensor logic is the tensor equation,\nbased on the observation that logical rules and Einstein summation are\nessentially the same operation, and all else can be reduced to them. I show how\nto elegantly implement key forms of neural, symbolic and statistical AI in\ntensor logic, including transformers, formal reasoning, kernel machines and\ngraphical models. Most importantly, tensor logic makes new directions possible,\nsuch as sound reasoning in embedding space. This combines the scalability and\nlearnability of neural networks with the reliability and transparency of\nsymbolic reasoning, and is potentially a basis for the wider adoption of AI."}
