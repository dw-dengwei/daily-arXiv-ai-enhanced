Despite\nits wide adoption, GRPO's gains are often inconsistent; for instance, a model\nmay show significant improvement in one reasoning domain, like mathematics, yet\nremain stagnant in another, such as medicine. This inconsistency raises a\ncritical question: under what conditions does GRPO improve reasoning and\ngeneralize out-of-distribution (OOD)? We investigate this from a data\ndistribution perspective. We first prove theoretically that GRPO is a\nconservative reweighting scheme, bounded by the base model's distribution and\nthus unable to discover completely novel solutions. We further validate this in\ncarefully designed controlled studies by training transformers from scratch,\nevaluating generalization across reasoning depth, input length, token\nrepresentation, and compositionality. Our results provide a principled\nexplanation for GRPO's boundaries: OOD improvement emerges only when the target\ntask aligns with the model's pretrained biases, while gains on in-distribution\n(ID) tasks diminish as performance saturates. This reframes GRPO not as a\nuniversal reasoning enhancer but as a tool that sharpens pretraining biases.\nOur findings motivate future development of algorithms that can expand a\nmodel's capabilities beyond its pretraining origin."}

The influence of social bots within these platforms has garnered\nconsiderable attention from researchers, leading to the development of numerous\ndetection technologies.

Existing Graph Neural Network\n(GNN)-based methods cannot be directly applied due to the issues of limited\ncontrol over social agents, the black-box nature of bot detectors, and the\nheterogeneity of bots. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the\nfirst adversarial multi-agent Reinforcement learning framework for social Bot\ncontrol attacks (RoBCtrl) targeting GNN-based social bot detectors.\nSpecifically, we use a diffusion model to generate high-fidelity bot accounts\nby reconstructing existing account data with minor modifications, thereby\nevading detection on social platforms.

Using the application graphs from GUIrilla\ncrawler, we construct and release GUIrilla-Task, a large-scale dataset of\n27,171 functionally grounded tasks across 1,108 macOS applications, each\nannotated with full-desktop and window-level screenshots, accessibility\nmetadata, and semantic action traces. Empirical results show that tuning\nLLM-based agents on GUIrilla-Task significantly improves performance on\ndownstream UI tasks, outperforming synthetic baselines on the ScreenSpot Pro\nbenchmark while using 97% less data. We also release macapptree, an open-source\nlibrary for reproducible collection of structured accessibility metadata, along\nwith the full GUIrilla-Task dataset, the manually verified GUIrilla-Gold\nbenchmark, and the framework code to support open research in desktop autonomy."}

In fact, each test\nenvironment highlights the benefit of a different aspect: the counterfactual\ntest emphasizes user satisfaction in the long-terms, while the factual test\nfocuses on predicting subsequent user behaviors on platforms. Therefore, it is\ndesirable to have a model that performs well on both tests rather than only\none. In this work, we introduce a new learning framework, called Bias-adaptive\nPreference distillation Learning (BPL), to gradually uncover user preferences\nwith dual distillation strategies. These distillation strategies are designed\nto drive high performance in both factual and counterfactual test environments.\nEmploying a specialized form of teacher-student distillation from a biased\nmodel, BPL retains accurate preference knowledge aligned with the collected\nfeedback, leading to high performance in the factual test.

Further, it implicitly\ndiminishes work that does not push the performance-frontier, but aims at\nimproving our understanding of these techniques. This paper argues two points:\n(i) RL research should stop focusing solely on demonstrating agent\ncapabilities, and focus more on advancing the science and understanding of\nreinforcement learning; and (ii) we need to be more precise on how our\nbenchmarks map to the underlying mathematical formalisms.

The generative model of active inference uses\nDempster-Shafer theory and a Gaussian sensor model, which provides input to the\nagent. The generative process employs a Bayesian approach to update a posterior\nprobability distribution. We calculate the variational free energy for all\npositions within the area by assessing the divergence between a pignistic\nprobability distribution of the evidence map and a posterior probability\ndistribution of a target object based on the observations, including the level\nof surprise associated with receiving new observations. Using the free energy,\nwe direct the agents' movements in a simulation by taking an incremental step\ntoward a position that minimizes the free energy.

The theory indicates that the\noutcome of local unlearning--methods that only use gradients computed on the\nforget set--is path-dependent. That is, a model's behavior during unlearning is\ninfluenced by the order of its training stages during learning, making it\nimpossible for path-oblivious algorithms to universally achieve Retrain\nEquivalence. We empirically demonstrate the same phenomenon in LLM\npost-training across Llama and Qwen models (1B to 14B) with gradient ascent,\nNPO, and SimNPO local unlearning algorithms.

The proposed MEET-Sepsis framework achieves\ncompetitive prediction accuracy using only 20% of the ICU monitoring time\nrequired by SOTA methods, significantly advancing early SP. Extensive\nvalidation confirms its efficacy. Code is available at:\nhttps://github.com/yueliangy/MEET-Sepsis."}

Although state-of-the-art continual learning (CL)\nmethods have employed pre-trained models (PTMs) to enhance task-specific\ngeneralization, they typically assume identical training and testing domains\nfor each task and therefore perform poorly in DGCL. To this end, we propose\nadaptive Domain Transformation (DoT), an innovative PTMs-based approach\ntailored to DGCL. Inspired by the distributed-plus-hub theory of the human\nbrain, DoT disentangles semantic- and domain-relevant information in\nrepresentation learning, and adaptively transforms task representations across\nvarious domains for output alignment, ensuring balanced and generalized\npredictions. DoT serves as a plug-in strategy that greatly facilitates\nstate-of-the-art CL baselines under both full parameter tuning and\nparameter-efficient tuning paradigms in DGCL, validated by extensive\nexperiments. Also, DoT is shown to accumulate domain-generalizable knowledge\nfrom DGCL, and ensure resource efficiency with a lightweight implementation."}

These distillation strategies are designed\nto drive high performance in both factual and counterfactual test environments.\nEmploying a specialized form of teacher-student distillation from a biased\nmodel, BPL retains accurate preference knowledge aligned with the collected\nfeedback, leading to high performance in the factual test. Furthermore, through\nself-distillation with reliability filtering, BPL iteratively refines its\nknowledge throughout the training process. This enables the model to produce\nmore accurate predictions across a broader range of user-item combinations,\nthereby improving performance in the counterfactual test. Comprehensive\nexperiments validate the effectiveness of BPL in both factual and\ncounterfactual tests. Our implementation is accessible via:\nhttps://github.com/SeongKu-Kang/BPL."}

However, previous works fail to distinguish\nmulti-hop neighbors and treat the graph as a standalone modality, which\nfragments the overall understanding. This limitation presents two key\nchallenges in multimodal learning: (1) integrating structural information from\nmulti-hop neighbors into foundational models, and (2) fusing modality-specific\ninformation in a principled manner. To address these challenges, we revisit the\nrole of graphs in multimodal learning within the era of foundation models and\npropose Graph4MM, a graph-based multimodal learning framework. To be specific,\nwe introduce Hop-Diffused Attention, which integrates multi-hop structural\ninformation into self-attention through causal masking and hop diffusion.\nFurthermore, we design MM-QFormer, a multi-mapping querying transformer for\ncross-modal fusion. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we show that\nleveraging structures to integrate both intra- and inter-modal interactions\nimproves multimodal understanding beyond treating them as a standalone\nmodality.

No updates will be made to it during the application. This is\ninappropriate for many dynamic and open environments, where unexpected samples\nfrom unseen classes may appear. In such an environment, the model should be\nable to detect these novel samples from unseen classes and learn them after\nthey are labeled. We call this paradigm Autonomous Learning after Model\nDeployment (ALMD). The learning here is continuous and involves no human\nengineers. Labeling in this scenario is performed by human co-workers or other\nknowledgeable agents, which is similar to what humans do when they encounter an\nunfamiliar object and ask another person for its name. In ALMD, the detection\nof novel samples is dynamic and differs from traditional out-of-distribution\n(OOD) detection in that the set of in-distribution (ID) classes expands as new\nclasses are learned during application, whereas ID classes is fixed in\ntraditional OOD detection. Learning is also different from classic supervised\nlearning because in ALMD, we learn the encountered new classes immediately and\nincrementally. It is difficult to retrain the model from scratch using all the\npast data from the ID classes and the novel samples from newly discovered\nclasses, as this would be resource- and time-consuming. Apart from these two\nchallenges, ALMD faces the data scarcity issue because instances of new classes\noften appear sporadically in real-life applications. To address these issues,\nwe propose a novel method, PLDA, which performs dynamic OOD detection and\nincremental learning of new classes on the fly. Empirical evaluations will\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of PLDA."}

Scaling them\nto improve representation, however, often demands substantial memory and\ncompute costs, such as the Key-Value (KV) cache used during auto-regressive\ndecoding. Skip connections offer a promising way to improve representation\nwithout bloating resource usage, yet most prior works either improve\nexpressivity while leaving KV costs unchanged, or reduce memory at the cost of\nweaker representation. In this work, we propose SkipV1Former, a Transformer\nvariant that uses skip connections from the first layer's Value heads to\nstrengthen model representation and reduce KV cache. Specifically, from the\nsecond block onward, each layer reuses half of its Value heads from the very\nfirst layer, while computing the other half as usual-cutting Value projections\nand V cache by nearly 50 \\%. Theoretically, we show that routing uncompressed\nfirst-layer Values into deeper layers restores information lost to compression\nand accelerates the model's implicit mesa-optimization-a key pattern of\nTransformer in auto-regressive tasks. Empirically, across different model\nscales, SkipV1Former delivers consistent reductions of approximately 25 \\% in\nKV cache while improving perplexity relative to standard Multi-Head Attention\n(MHA) Transformers and some advanced variants.

Although state-of-the-art continual learning (CL)\nmethods have employed pre-trained models (PTMs) to enhance task-specific\ngeneralization, they typically assume identical training and testing domains\nfor each task and therefore perform poorly in DGCL. To this end, we propose\nadaptive Domain Transformation (DoT), an innovative PTMs-based approach\ntailored to DGCL. Inspired by the distributed-plus-hub theory of the human\nbrain, DoT disentangles semantic- and domain-relevant information in\nrepresentation learning, and adaptively transforms task representations across\nvarious domains for output alignment, ensuring balanced and generalized\npredictions. DoT serves as a plug-in strategy that greatly facilitates\nstate-of-the-art CL baselines under both full parameter tuning and\nparameter-efficient tuning paradigms in DGCL, validated by extensive\nexperiments. Also, DoT is shown to accumulate domain-generalizable knowledge\nfrom DGCL, and ensure resource efficiency with a lightweight implementation."}

Most modern diffusion-based\nlanguage models employ masked diffusion, where decoding involves iteratively\nprocessing masked tokens based on a binary decision: either retaining the mask\nor replacing it with the predicted token. However, this binary choice discards\nvaluable predictive information when the mask is retained. To address this\nlimitation, we introduce soft-masking (SM), a novel method that dynamically\nblends the embedding of the mask token with the embeddings of the top-$k$\npredicted tokens from the previous decoding step, for each retained mask. This\nprovides the model with a more informative prior, preserving context from\nearlier computations and allowing partial information about masked tokens to\npropagate beyond a single step.

However, a significant drawback of many such methods is\ntheir lack of convergence guarantees, as various low-rank projection approaches\nintroduce inherent biases relative to the original optimization algorithms,\nwhich contribute to performance gaps compared to full-parameter training.\nAiming to tackle this problem, this paper investigates the layerwise sampling\ntechnique for debiasing low-rank projection mechanisms. In particular, an\ninstantiation of the paradigm gives rise to a novel and unbiased low-rank\noptimization method built upon GaLore's mechanism and the Muon algorithm, named\nGaLore Unbiased with Muon (GUM). We theoretically prove our method matches the\nconvergence guarantees of the base Muon algorithm while preserving the memory\nefficiency of low-rank techniques. Empirical experiments on LLM fine-tuning and\npretraining also demonstrate non-trivial improvements over GaLore and even\nbetter performance than full-parameter training. Further investigation shows\nthat the improvement of this technique comes from a more uniform distribution\nof knowledge inside layers, leading to more efficient utilization of the model\nparameter space and better memorization."}

In this work,\nwe present a comprehensive empirical study that identifies efficiency\nbottlenecks in web-interactive agentic systems.

We\nconduct a comprehensive empirical study across 15 models and 5 providers to\ndemonstrate high variability in API-based agentic systems. We observe that web\nenvironment latency can contribute as much as 53.7% to the overall latency in a\nweb-based agentic system. To improve latency, we propose SpecCache, a caching\nframework augmented with speculative execution that can reduce web environment\noverhead.

Such interactions between users and an\nalgorithm often unfold over multiple steps, during which strategic users can\nguide the algorithm to better align with their true interests by selectively\nengaging with content. However, users frequently exhibit inconsistent\npreferences: they may spend considerable time on content that offers little\nlong-term value, inadvertently signaling that such content is desirable.\nFocusing on the user side, this raises a key question: what does it take for\nsuch users to align the algorithm with their true interests?\n  To investigate these dynamics, we model the user's decision process as split\nbetween a rational system 2 that decides whether to engage and an impulsive\nsystem 1 that determines how long engagement lasts. We then study a\nmulti-leader, single-follower extensive Stackelberg game, where users,\nspecifically system 2, lead by committing to engagement strategies and the\nalgorithm best-responds based on observed interactions. We define the burden of\nalignment as the minimum horizon over which users must optimize to effectively\nsteer the algorithm. We show that a critical horizon exists: users who are\nsufficiently foresighted can achieve alignment, while those who are not are\ninstead aligned to the algorithm's objective. This critical horizon can be\nlong, imposing a substantial burden. However, even a small, costly signal\n(e.g., an extra click) can significantly reduce it. Overall, our framework\nexplains how users with inconsistent preferences can align an engagement-driven\nalgorithm with their interests in a Stackelberg equilibrium, highlighting both\nthe challenges and potential remedies for achieving alignment."}

By disentangling and reweighting key\nimage attributes such as color, texture, and shape, HSCM enhances\ngeneralization across diverse domains, ensuring robust performance and\ninterpretability.

Doug is just an encoding of the light linear functional programming\nlanguage (LLFPL) described by (Schimanski2009, ch. 7).

Doug allows for some points on the\nembedding space of a neural network to be interpreted as types, where the types\nof nearby points are similar both in structure and content. Types in Doug are\ntherefore learnable by a neural network. Following (Chollet, 2019), (Card,\n1983), and (Newell, 1981), we view skill as the application of a procedure, or\nprogram of action, that causes a goal to be satisfied.
