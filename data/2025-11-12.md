### [2] [Beyond Correctness: Confidence-Aware Reward Modeling for Enhancing Large Language Model Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07483)
*Qianxi He,Qingyu Ren,Shanzhe Lei,Xuhong Wang,Yingchun Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于置信度的奖励模型C2RM，用于增强STEM推理能力，通过惩罚低置信度的正确答案来促进更稳健和逻辑一致的推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于规则的奖励强化学习在小规模基础模型上经常产生低质量推理链或推理过程与最终答案不一致的问题，限制了资源有限组织在小规模模型上进行直接强化学习训练的能力。

Method: 开发了置信度奖励模型，不仅惩罚错误答案，还惩罚低置信度的正确答案；通过静态评估、Best-of-N推理测试和基于PPO的强化学习训练验证方法有效性。

Result: 该方法在多个STEM基准测试中优于多个最先进的开源奖励模型。

Conclusion: 置信度奖励模型能够有效提升小规模模型的STEM推理能力，促进更稳健和逻辑一致的推理过程。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shifted the post-training paradigm from traditional instruction tuning and human preference alignment toward reinforcement learning (RL) focused on reasoning capabilities. However, numerous technical reports indicate that purely rule-based reward RL frequently results in poor-quality reasoning chains or inconsistencies between reasoning processes and final answers, particularly when the base model is of smaller scale. During the RL exploration process, models might employ low-quality reasoning chains due to the lack of knowledge, occasionally producing correct answers randomly and receiving rewards based on established rule-based judges. This constrains the potential for resource-limited organizations to conduct direct reinforcement learning training on smaller-scale models. We propose a novel confidence-based reward model tailored for enhancing STEM reasoning capabilities. Unlike conventional approaches, our model penalizes not only incorrect answers but also low-confidence correct responses, thereby promoting more robust and logically consistent reasoning. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through static evaluations, Best-of-N inference tests, and PPO-based RL training. Our method outperforms several state-of-the-art open-source reward models across diverse STEM benchmarks. We release our codes and model in https://github.com/qianxiHe147/C2RM.

### [3] [Beyond Fact Retrieval: Episodic Memory for RAG with Generative Semantic Workspaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07587)
*Shreyas Rajesh,Pavan Holur,Chenda Duan,David Chong,Vwani Roychowdhury*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Generative Semantic Workspace (GSW)框架，这是一个受神经科学启发的生成式记忆系统，旨在解决LLM在长上下文推理中的挑战，特别是在跟踪实体在事件中的演变方面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在处理长文本时面临上下文窗口有限和性能随序列长度下降的问题。现有的基于检索的方法（如RAG）主要针对事实检索，无法构建时空锚定的叙事表示来跟踪实体在事件中的演变。

Method: GSW框架包含两个组件：Operator将观察映射到中间语义结构，Reconciler将这些结构整合到持久工作空间中，强制执行时间、空间和逻辑一致性。

Result: 在Episodic Memory Benchmark (100k-1M tokens)上，GSW比现有RAG基线性能提升高达20%，同时减少51%的查询时上下文token，显著降低推理时间成本。

Conclusion: GSW为LLM提供了类人情节记忆的具体蓝图，为能够进行长视野推理的更强大智能体铺平了道路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face fundamental challenges in long-context reasoning: many documents exceed their finite context windows, while performance on texts that do fit degrades with sequence length, necessitating their augmentation with external memory frameworks. Current solutions, which have evolved from retrieval using semantic embeddings to more sophisticated structured knowledge graphs representations for improved sense-making and associativity, are tailored for fact-based retrieval and fail to build the space-time-anchored narrative representations required for tracking entities through episodic events. To bridge this gap, we propose the \textbf{Generative Semantic Workspace} (GSW), a neuro-inspired generative memory framework that builds structured, interpretable representations of evolving situations, enabling LLMs to reason over evolving roles, actions, and spatiotemporal contexts. Our framework comprises an \textit{Operator}, which maps incoming observations to intermediate semantic structures, and a \textit{Reconciler}, which integrates these into a persistent workspace that enforces temporal, spatial, and logical coherence. On the Episodic Memory Benchmark (EpBench) \cite{huet_episodic_2025} comprising corpora ranging from 100k to 1M tokens in length, GSW outperforms existing RAG based baselines by up to \textbf{20\%}. Furthermore, GSW is highly efficient, reducing query-time context tokens by \textbf{51\%} compared to the next most token-efficient baseline, reducing inference time costs considerably. More broadly, GSW offers a concrete blueprint for endowing LLMs with human-like episodic memory, paving the way for more capable agents that can reason over long horizons.

TL;DR: AIA Forecaster是一个基于LLM的判断性预测系统，通过智能搜索、监督代理和统计校准技术，在ForecastBench上达到人类超级预测者水平，并在预测市场基准上与市场共识集成后表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发能够利用非结构化数据进行大规模专家级预测的AI系统，填补现有LLM在判断性预测方面的不足。

Method: 结合三个核心要素：智能搜索高质量新闻源、监督代理协调不同预测、统计校准技术对抗LLM行为偏差。

Result: 在ForecastBench上达到人类超级预测者水平，在预测市场基准上，AIA Forecaster与市场共识集成后优于单独的市场共识。

Conclusion: 建立了AI预测的新技术水平，为未来研究提供了实用的可转移建议，是首个可验证实现大规模专家级预测的工作。

Abstract: This technical report describes the AIA Forecaster, a Large Language Model (LLM)-based system for judgmental forecasting using unstructured data. The AIA Forecaster approach combines three core elements: agentic search over high-quality news sources, a supervisor agent that reconciles disparate forecasts for the same event, and a set of statistical calibration techniques to counter behavioral biases in large language models. On the ForecastBench benchmark (Karger et al., 2024), the AIA Forecaster achieves performance equal to human superforecasters, surpassing prior LLM baselines. In addition to reporting on ForecastBench, we also introduce a more challenging forecasting benchmark sourced from liquid prediction markets. While the AIA Forecaster underperforms market consensus on this benchmark, an ensemble combining AIA Forecaster with market consensus outperforms consensus alone, demonstrating that our forecaster provides additive information. Our work establishes a new state of the art in AI forecasting and provides practical, transferable recommendations for future research. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that verifiably achieves expert-level forecasting at scale.

Conclusion: 这项工作代表了向全球AI辅助甲烷泄漏检测系统迈出的关键一步，能够处理预期大幅增加的成像光谱仪数据量。

Abstract: Mitigating anthropogenic methane sources is one the most cost-effective levers to slow down global warming. While satellite-based imaging spectrometers, such as EMIT, PRISMA, and EnMAP, can detect these point sources, current methane retrieval methods based on matched filters still produce a high number of false detections requiring laborious manual verification. This paper describes the operational deployment of a machine learning system for detecting methane emissions within the Methane Alert and Response System (MARS) of the United Nations Environment Programme's International Methane Emissions Observatory. We created the largest and most diverse global dataset of annotated methane plumes from three imaging spectrometer missions and quantitatively compared different deep learning model configurations. Focusing on the requirements for operational deployment, we extended prior evaluation methodologies from small tiled datasets to full granule evaluation. This revealed that deep learning models still produce a large number of false detections, a problem we address with model ensembling, which reduced false detections by over 74%. Deployed in the MARS pipeline, our system processes scenes and proposes plumes to analysts, accelerating the detection and analysis process. During seven months of operational deployment, it facilitated the verification of 1,351 distinct methane leaks, resulting in 479 stakeholder notifications. We further demonstrate the model's utility in verifying mitigation success through case studies in Libya, Argentina, Oman, and Azerbaijan. Our work represents a critical step towards a global AI-assisted methane leak detection system, which is required to process the dramatically higher data volumes expected from new and current imaging spectrometers.

### [6] [WaterMod: Modular Token-Rank Partitioning for Probability-Balanced LLM Watermarking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07863)
*Shinwoo Park,Hyejin Park,Hyeseon Ahn,Yo-Sub Han*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: WaterMod是一种新颖的水印方法，通过概率感知的模块化规则在LLM生成文本中嵌入可验证标记，既保持生成质量又支持零位和多位水印设置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于logit的水印方法会排除最高概率词汇，损害生成流畅性。同时欧盟AI法案等法规要求合成文本必须携带机器可验证的来源标记。

Method: 使用模块化规则：将词汇按概率降序排列，通过余数rank mod k分区，将语义相似的相邻词汇分配到不同类别。在零位设置中，熵自适应门选择偶数或奇数奇偶性作为绿色列表；在多位设置中，当前有效载荷数字d选择满足rank mod k = d的颜色类别。

Result: 实验结果表明WaterMod在保持生成质量的同时，在零位和多位设置下都实现了强大的水印检测性能，这种稳健性在自然语言生成、数学推理和代码合成等任务中均得到验证。

Conclusion: WaterMod通过模块化算术同时支持二进制归属和丰富有效载荷，为LLM生成文本提供了有效的来源追踪解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models now draft news, legal analyses, and software code with human-level fluency. At the same time, regulations such as the EU AI Act mandate that each synthetic passage carry an imperceptible, machine-verifiable mark for provenance. Conventional logit-based watermarks satisfy this requirement by selecting a pseudorandom green vocabulary at every decoding step and boosting its logits, yet the random split can exclude the highest-probability token and thus erode fluency. WaterMod mitigates this limitation through a probability-aware modular rule. The vocabulary is first sorted in descending model probability; the resulting ranks are then partitioned by the residue rank mod k, which distributes adjacent-and therefore semantically similar-tokens across different classes. A fixed bias of small magnitude is applied to one selected class. In the zero-bit setting (k=2), an entropy-adaptive gate selects either the even or the odd parity as the green list. Because the top two ranks fall into different parities, this choice embeds a detectable signal while guaranteeing that at least one high-probability token remains available for sampling. In the multi-bit regime (k>2), the current payload digit d selects the color class whose ranks satisfy rank mod k = d. Biasing the logits of that class embeds exactly one base-k digit per decoding step, thereby enabling fine-grained provenance tracing. The same modular arithmetic therefore supports both binary attribution and rich payloads. Experimental results demonstrate that WaterMod consistently attains strong watermark detection performance while maintaining generation quality in both zero-bit and multi-bit settings. This robustness holds across a range of tasks, including natural language generation, mathematical reasoning, and code synthesis. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/Shinwoo-Park/WaterMod.

### [7] [Confidence-Aware Neural Decoding of Overt Speech from EEG: Toward Robust Brain-Computer Interfaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07890)
*Soowon Kim,Byung-Kwan Ko,Seo-Hyun Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种置信度感知的解码框架，结合深度集成、后校准和选择性分类，用于从脑电图中解码语音命令，提高准确性和可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非侵入性脑机接口需要既准确又可信，现有的语音解码方法缺乏对不确定性的量化和可信决策机制。

Method: 使用紧凑的语音导向卷积网络的深度集成，结合后校准和选择性分类，通过集成预测熵、前二边际和互信息量化不确定性，并设置弃权选项。

Result: 在泄漏安全的时间连续数据集上评估，相比基线方法，该方法产生更可靠的概率估计、改进的选择性性能以及平衡的每类接受率。

Conclusion: 置信度感知神经解码可以为现实世界脑机接口通信系统提供稳健的部署导向行为。

Abstract: Non-invasive brain-computer interfaces that decode spoken commands from electroencephalogram must be both accurate and trustworthy. We present a confidence-aware decoding framework that couples deep ensembles of compact, speech-oriented convolutional networks with post-hoc calibration and selective classification. Uncertainty is quantified using ensemble-based predictive entropy, top-two margin, and mutual information, and decisions are made with an abstain option governed by an accuracy-coverage operating point. The approach is evaluated on a multi-class overt speech dataset using a leakage-safe, block-stratified split that respects temporal contiguity. Compared with widely used baselines, the proposed method yields more reliable probability estimates, improved selective performance across operating points, and balanced per-class acceptance. These results suggest that confidence-aware neural decoding can provide robust, deployment-oriented behavior for real-world brain-computer interface communication systems.

### [8] [Toward Robust EEG-based Intention Decoding during Misarticulated Speech in Aphasia](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07895)
*Ha-Na Jo,Jung-Sun Lee,Eunyeong Ko*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 开发了一种基于EEG的沟通辅助系统，通过软多任务学习框架识别失语症患者的发音错误意图，在发音错误情况下仍能准确解码意图


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 失语症严重限制语言沟通，但目前基于EEG的沟通支持系统很少针对失语症患者开发，需要解决这一研究空白

Method: 招募失语症患者进行韩语自动语音任务，记录EEG信号，使用软多任务学习框架结合最大均值差异正则化，重点关注delta特征

Result: 模型正确发音试验准确率58.6%，错误发音试验准确率45.5%，比基线在错误发音试验上提高超过45%

Conclusion: 证明了基于EEG的辅助系统在失语症患者真实世界不完美语音条件下的可行性

Abstract: Aphasia severely limits verbal communication due to impaired language production, often leading to frequent misarticulations during speech attempts. Despite growing interest in brain-computer interface technologies, relatively little attention has been paid to developing EEG-based communication support systems tailored for aphasic patients. To address this gap, we recruited a single participant with expressive aphasia and conducted an Korean-based automatic speech task. EEG signals were recorded during task performance, and each trial was labeled as either correct or incorrect depending on whether the intended word was successfully spoken. Spectral analysis revealed distinct neural activation patterns between the two trial types: misarticulated trials exhibited excessive delta power across widespread channels and increased theta-alpha activity in frontal regions. Building upon these findings, we developed a soft multitask learning framework with maximum mean discrepancy regularization that focus on delta features to jointly optimize class discrimination while aligning the EEG feature distributions of correct and misarticulated trials. The proposed model achieved 58.6 % accuracy for correct and 45.5 % for misarticulated trials-outperforming the baseline by over 45 % on the latter-demonstrating robust intention decoding even under articulation errors. These results highlight the feasibility of EEG-based assistive systems capable of supporting real-world, imperfect speech conditions in aphasia patients.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SparseRM利用稀疏自编码器从LLM表示中提取偏好相关信息，构建轻量级可解释的奖励模型，在仅使用不到1%可训练参数的情况下优于主流奖励模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在有限资源下训练可靠的奖励模型具有挑战性，因为依赖大规模偏好标注且微调LLM成本高昂。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器分解LLM表示，提取偏好相关特征方向，通过投影计算对齐分数，最后用简单奖励头聚合预测偏好分数。

Result: 在三个偏好建模任务上的实验表明，SparseRM优于大多数主流奖励模型，同时仅使用不到1%的可训练参数。

Conclusion: SparseRM能够无缝集成到下游对齐流程中，展示了高效对齐的潜力。

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) are a core component in the post-training of large language models (LLMs), serving as proxies for human preference evaluation and guiding model alignment. However, training reliable RMs under limited resources remains challenging due to the reliance on large-scale preference annotations and the high cost of fine-tuning LLMs. To address this, we propose SparseRM, which leverages Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) to extract preference-relevant information encoded in model representations, enabling the construction of a lightweight and interpretable reward model. SparseRM first employs SAE to decompose LLM representations into interpretable directions that capture preference-relevant features. The representations are then projected onto these directions to compute alignment scores, which quantify the strength of each preference feature in the representations. A simple reward head aggregates these scores to predict preference scores. Experiments on three preference modeling tasks show that SparseRM achieves superior performance over most mainstream RMs while using less than 1% of trainable parameters. Moreover, it integrates seamlessly into downstream alignment pipelines, highlighting its potential for efficient alignment.

*Chaeri Kim,Jaeyeon Bae,Taehwan Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

Abstract: Deep learning models have been successful in many areas but understanding their behaviors still remains a black-box. Most prior explainable AI (XAI) approaches have focused on interpreting and explaining how models make predictions. In contrast, we would like to understand how data can be explained with deep learning model training and propose a novel approach to understand the data via one of the most common media - language - so that humans can easily understand. Our approach proposes a pipeline to generate textual descriptions that can explain the data with large language models by incorporating external knowledge bases. However, generated data descriptions may still include irrelevant information, so we introduce to exploit influence estimation to choose the most informative textual descriptions, along with the CLIP score. Furthermore, based on the phenomenon of cross-modal transferability, we propose a novel benchmark task named cross-modal transfer classification to examine the effectiveness of our textual descriptions. In the experiment of zero-shot setting, we show that our textual descriptions are more effective than other baseline descriptions, and furthermore, we successfully boost the performance of the model trained only on images across all nine image classification datasets. These results are further supported by evaluation using GPT-4o. Through our approach, we may gain insights into the inherent interpretability of the decision-making process of the model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有负采样策略存在假阴性漏洞、泛化能力有限和样本难度控制不足等问题，需要更有效的负采样方法

Result: 在六个基准数据集上验证有效性，在UMLS和YAGO3-10数据集上所有三个评估指标均达到最先进水平

Conclusion: DANS-KGC通过扩散模型和动态难度调整机制，有效解决了现有负采样策略的局限性，在知识图谱补全任务中表现出优异的性能和泛化能力

Abstract: Negative sampling (NS) strategies play a crucial role in knowledge graph representation. In order to overcome the limitations of existing negative sampling strategies, such as vulnerability to false negatives, limited generalization, and lack of control over sample hardness, we propose DANS-KGC (Diffusion-based Adaptive Negative Sampling for Knowledge Graph Completion). DANS-KGC comprises three key components: the Difficulty Assessment Module (DAM), the Adaptive Negative Sampling Module (ANS), and the Dynamic Training Mechanism (DTM). DAM evaluates the learning difficulty of entities by integrating semantic and structural features. Based on this assessment, ANS employs a conditional diffusion model with difficulty-aware noise scheduling, leveraging semantic and neighborhood information during the denoising phase to generate negative samples of diverse hardness. DTM further enhances learning by dynamically adjusting the hardness distribution of negative samples throughout training, enabling a curriculum-style progression from easy to hard examples. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization ability of DANS-KGC, with the method achieving state-of-the-art results on all three evaluation metrics for the UMLS and YAGO3-10 datasets.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究通过脑电图和卡片分类任务揭示了人类适应性推理的神经机制，发现delta-theta-alpha振荡协调参与规则推断和注意力稳定，而多模态大语言模型仅能进行短期反馈调整，缺乏真正的适应性推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 适应性推理使人类能够在环境规则或情境变化时灵活调整推理策略，但其潜在的神经动力学机制尚不清楚。本研究旨在探索适应性推理的神经生理机制，并与多模态大语言模型进行比较。

Method: 使用卡片分类范式结合脑电图技术，分析刺激锁定和反馈锁定的神经活动，并与多模态大语言模型的性能进行比较。

Result: 研究发现协调的delta-theta-alpha动力学：早期delta-theta活动反映探索性监测和规则推断，而枕叶alpha参与表明成功规则识别后的注意力稳定。多模态大语言模型仅表现出短期反馈驱动的调整，缺乏层次规则抽象或真正的适应性推理。

Conclusion: 这些发现识别了人类适应性推理的神经特征，并强调了需要开发包含振荡反馈协调的脑启发人工智能，以实现真正的上下文敏感适应。

Abstract: Adaptive reasoning enables humans to flexibly adjust inference strategies when environmental rules or contexts change, yet its underlying neural dynamics remain unclear. This study investigated the neurophysiological mechanisms of adaptive reasoning using a card-sorting paradigm combined with electroencephalography and compared human performance with that of a multimodal large language model. Stimulus- and feedback-locked analyses revealed coordinated delta-theta-alpha dynamics: early delta-theta activity reflected exploratory monitoring and rule inference, whereas occipital alpha engagement indicated confirmatory stabilization of attention after successful rule identification. In contrast, the multimodal large language model exhibited only short-term feedback-driven adjustments without hierarchical rule abstraction or genuine adaptive reasoning. These findings identify the neural signatures of human adaptive reasoning and highlight the need for brain-inspired artificial intelligence that incorporates oscillatory feedback coordination for true context-sensitive adaptation.

Abstract: A diffusion-based neural decoding framework optimized for real-time imagined speech classification in individuals with aphasia. The system integrates a lightweight conditional diffusion encoder and convolutional classifier trained using subject-specific EEG data acquired from a Korean-language paradigm. A dual-criterion early stopping strategy enabled rapid convergence under limited calibration data, while dropout regularization and grouped temporal convolutions ensured stable generalization. During online operation, continuous EEG streams were processed in two-second sliding windows to generate class probabilities that dynamically modulated visual and auditory feedback according to decoding confidence. Across twenty real-time trials, the framework achieved 65% top-1 and 70% top-2 accuracy, outperforming offline evaluation (50% top-1). These results demonstrate the feasibility of deploying diffusion-based EEG decoding under practical clinical constraints, maintaining reliable performance despite environmental variability and minimal preprocessing. The proposed framework advances the translation of imagined speech brain-computer interfaces toward clinical communication support for individuals with severe expressive language impairment.

Abstract: Personalized mathematics education is growing rapidly, creating a strong demand for large sets of similar practice problems. Yet existing studies on mathematics problem generation have focused on data augmentation for training neural language models rather than on direct educational deployment. To bridge this gap, we define a new task, Isomorphic Math Problem Generation (IMPG), designed to produce structurally consistent variants of source problems. Subsequently, we explored LLM-based frameworks for automatic IMPG through successive refinements, and established Computational Blueprints for Isomorphic Twins (CBIT).

Abstract: Brain-computer interface (BCI) research, while promising, has largely been confined to static and fixed environments, limiting real-world applicability. To move towards practical BCI, we introduce a real-time wireless imagined speech electroencephalogram (EEG) decoding system designed for flexibility and everyday use. Our framework focuses on practicality, demonstrating extensibility beyond wired EEG devices to portable, wireless hardware. A user identification module recognizes the operator and provides a personalized, user-specific service. To achieve seamless, real-time operation, we utilize the lab streaming layer to manage the continuous streaming of live EEG signals to the personalized decoder. This end-to-end pipeline enables a functional real-time application capable of classifying user commands from imagined speech EEG signals, achieving an overall 4-class accuracy of 62.00 % on a wired device and 46.67 % on a portable wireless headset. This paper demonstrates a significant step towards truly practical and accessible BCI technology, establishing a clear direction for future research in robust, practical, and personalized neural interfaces.

Abstract: Efficient retrieval of external knowledge bases and web pages is crucial for enhancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs. Previous works on training LLMs to leverage external retrievers for solving complex problems have predominantly employed end-to-end reinforcement learning. However, these approaches neglect supervision over the reasoning process, making it difficult to guarantee logical coherence and rigor. To address these limitations, we propose Thinker, a hierarchical thinking model for deep search through multi-turn interaction, making the reasoning process supervisable and verifiable. It decomposes complex problems into independently solvable sub-problems, each dually represented in both natural language and an equivalent logical function to support knowledge base and web searches. Concurrently, dependencies between sub-problems are passed as parameters via these logical functions, enhancing the logical coherence of the problem-solving process. To avoid unnecessary external searches, we perform knowledge boundary determination to check if a sub-problem is within the LLM's intrinsic knowledge, allowing it to answer directly. Experimental results indicate that with as few as several hundred training samples, the performance of Thinker is competitive with established baselines. Furthermore, when scaled to the full training set, Thinker significantly outperforms these methods across various datasets and model sizes.

Motivation: 时间序列生成面临的主要挑战是建模时间动态的固有随机性，而传统扩散模型计算效率低，普通流匹配的ODE公式无法显式捕捉随机性，限制了生成序列的保真度。

Method: 提出TimeFlow框架，采用SDE基础的流匹配方法，设计组件分解的速度场来捕捉时间序列的多方面结构，并在普通流匹配优化中增加随机项以增强表达能力。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验表明，该模型在生成质量、多样性和效率方面始终优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: TimeFlow是一个灵活通用的框架，支持在统一框架内进行无条件生成和条件生成任务，能够高效生成高质量的时间序列数据。

Abstract: Generating high-quality time series data has emerged as a critical research topic due to its broad utility in supporting downstream time series mining tasks. A major challenge lies in modeling the intrinsic stochasticity of temporal dynamics, as real-world sequences often exhibit random fluctuations and localized variations. While diffusion models have achieved remarkable success, their generation process is computationally inefficient, often requiring hundreds to thousands of expensive function evaluations per sample. Flow matching has emerged as a more efficient paradigm, yet its conventional ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based formulation fails to explicitly capture stochasticity, thereby limiting the fidelity of generated sequences. By contrast, stochastic differential equation (SDE) are naturally suited for modeling randomness and uncertainty. Motivated by these insights, we propose TimeFlow, a novel SDE-based flow matching framework that integrates a encoder-only architecture. Specifically, we design a component-wise decomposed velocity field to capture the multi-faceted structure of time series and augment the vanilla flow-matching optimization with an additional stochastic term to enhance representational expressiveness. TimeFlow is flexible and general, supporting both unconditional and conditional generation tasks within a unified framework. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms strong baselines in generation quality, diversity, and efficiency.

Motivation: 解决深度学习ECG诊断中的两个主要障碍：处理不同配置ECG信号的通用性不足，以及样本不平衡导致的风险信号检测不足。

Method: 使用基于图的表示方法统一建模异质ECG信号，将ECG信号转换为图结构，结合去噪重建和对比学习来保留原始信息并突出病理模式。

Result: 在三个不同ECG数据集上的评估显示，VARS在所有数据集上均超越现有最先进模型，并在识别风险信号方面有显著提升。

Conclusion: VARS有望成为全面心脏健康评估的宝贵工具，提供可解释性并帮助临床医生做出明智决策。

Abstract: Despite the rapid advancements of electrocardiogram (ECG) signal diagnosis and analysis methods through deep learning, two major hurdles still limit their clinical adoption: the lack of versatility in processing ECG signals with diverse configurations, and the inadequate detection of risk signals due to sample imbalances. Addressing these challenges, we introduce VersAtile and Risk-Sensitive cardiac diagnosis (VARS), an innovative approach that employs a graph-based representation to uniformly model heterogeneous ECG signals. VARS stands out by transforming ECG signals into versatile graph structures that capture critical diagnostic features, irrespective of signal diversity in the lead count, sampling frequency, and duration. This graph-centric formulation also enhances diagnostic sensitivity, enabling precise localization and identification of abnormal ECG patterns that often elude standard analysis methods. To facilitate representation transformation, our approach integrates denoising reconstruction with contrastive learning to preserve raw ECG information while highlighting pathognomonic patterns. We rigorously evaluate the efficacy of VARS on three distinct ECG datasets, encompassing a range of structural variations. The results demonstrate that VARS not only consistently surpasses existing state-of-the-art models across all these datasets but also exhibits substantial improvement in identifying risk signals. Additionally, VARS offers interpretability by pinpointing the exact waveforms that lead to specific model outputs, thereby assisting clinicians in making informed decisions. These findings suggest that our VARS will likely emerge as an invaluable tool for comprehensive cardiac health assessment.

Conclusion: 提出的框架能够提供更细粒度的解释，增强模型误分类情况下的可解释性。

Abstract: Attribution-based explanation techniques capture key patterns to enhance visual interpretability; however, these patterns often lack the granularity needed for insight in fine-grained tasks, particularly in cases of model misclassification, where explanations may be insufficiently detailed. To address this limitation, we propose a fine-grained counterfactual explanation framework that generates both object-level and part-level interpretability, addressing two fundamental questions: (1) which fine-grained features contribute to model misclassification, and (2) where dominant local features influence counterfactual adjustments. Our approach yields explainable counterfactuals in a non-generative manner by quantifying similarity and weighting component contributions within regions of interest between correctly classified and misclassified samples. Furthermore, we introduce a saliency partition module grounded in Shapley value contributions, isolating features with region-specific relevance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach in capturing more granular, intuitively meaningful regions, surpassing fine-grained methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning abilities across specialized domains, motivating research into their application to legal reasoning. However, existing legal benchmarks often conflate factual recall with genuine inference, fragment the reasoning process, and overlook the quality of reasoning. To address these limitations, we introduce MSLR, the first Chinese multi-step legal reasoning dataset grounded in real-world judicial decision making. MSLR adopts the IRAC framework (Issue, Rule, Application, Conclusion) to model structured expert reasoning from official legal documents. In addition, we design a scalable Human-LLM collaborative annotation pipeline that efficiently produces fine-grained step-level reasoning annotations and provides a reusable methodological framework for multi-step reasoning datasets. Evaluation of multiple LLMs on MSLR shows only moderate performance, highlighting the challenges of adapting to complex legal reasoning. Further experiments demonstrate that Self-Initiated Chain-of-Thought prompts generated by models autonomously improve reasoning coherence and quality, outperforming human-designed prompts. MSLR contributes to advancing LLM reasoning and Chain-of-Thought strategies and offers open resources for future research.

Conclusion: ST-SAM通过完全依赖自注意力机制有效捕获局部和全局时空相关性，在交通预测任务中表现出色。

Abstract: We study the problem of traffic forecasting, aiming to predict the inflow and outflow of a region in the subsequent time slot. The problem is complex due to the intricate spatial and temporal interdependence among regions. Prior works study the spatial and temporal dependency in a decouple manner, failing to capture their joint effect. In this work, we propose ST-SAM, a novel and efficient Spatial-Temporal Self-Attention Model for traffic forecasting. ST-SAM uses a region embedding layer to learn time-specific embedding from traffic data for regions. Then, it employs a spatial-temporal dependency learning module based on self-attention mechanism to capture the joint spatial-temporal dependency for both nearby and faraway regions. ST-SAM entirely relies on self-attention to capture both local and global spatial-temporal correlations, which make it effective and efficient. Extensive experiments on two real world datasets show that ST-SAM is substantially more accurate and efficient than the state-of-the-art approaches (with an average improvement of up to 15% on RMSE, 17% on MAPE, and 32 times on training time in our experiments).

Conclusion: 首次使用LLMs针对语义陷阱验证的CQ生成研究，显著减少人工工作量并改善本体与专家知识的语义对齐。

Abstract: Competency Questions (CQs) play a crucial role in validating ontology design. While manually crafting CQs can be highly time-consuming and costly for ontology engineers, recent studies have explored the use of large language models (LLMs) to automate this process. However, prior approaches have largely evaluated generated CQs based on their similarity to existing datasets, which often fail to verify semantic pitfalls such as "Misusing allValuesFrom". Since such pitfalls cannot be reliably detected through rule-based methods, we propose a novel dataset and model of Validating Semantic Pitfalls in Ontology (VSPO) for CQ generation specifically designed to verify the semantic pitfalls. To simulate missing and misused axioms, we use LLMs to generate natural language definitions of classes and properties and introduce misalignments between the definitions and the ontology by removing axioms or altering logical operators (e.g., substituting union with intersection). We then fine-tune LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct to generate CQs that validate these semantic discrepancies between the provided definitions and the corresponding axioms. The resulting CQs can detect a broader range of modeling errors compared to existing public datasets. Our fine-tuned model demonstrates superior performance over baselines, showing 26% higher precision and 28.2% higher recall than GPT-4.1 in generating CQs for pitfall validation. This research enables automatic generation of TBox-validating CQs using LLMs, significantly reducing manual effort while improving semantic alignment between ontologies and expert knowledge. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to target semantic pitfall validation in CQ generation using LLMs.

Conclusion: PN-GNN在不损害泛化能力的情况下增强了逻辑规则的表达能力，在知识图谱推理任务中表现出竞争力。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) can effectively model structural information of graphs, making them widely used in knowledge graph (KG) reasoning. However, existing studies on the expressive power of GNNs mainly focuses on simple single-relation graphs, and there is still insufficient discussion on the power of GNN to express logical rules in KGs. How to enhance the logical expressive power of GNNs is still a key issue. Motivated by this, we propose Path-Neighbor enhanced GNN (PN-GNN), a method to enhance the logical expressive power of GNN by aggregating node-neighbor embeddings on the reasoning path. First, we analyze the logical expressive power of existing GNN-based methods and point out the shortcomings of the expressive power of these methods. Then, we theoretically investigate the logical expressive power of PN-GNN, showing that it not only has strictly stronger expressive power than C-GNN but also that its $(k+1)$-hop logical expressiveness is strictly superior to that of $k$-hop. Finally, we evaluate the logical expressive power of PN-GNN on six synthetic datasets and two real-world datasets. Both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments confirm that PN-GNN enhances the expressive power of logical rules without compromising generalization, as evidenced by its competitive performance in KG reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Multi-view multi-label feature selection aims to identify informative features from heterogeneous views, where each sample is associated with multiple interdependent labels. This problem is particularly important in machine learning involving high-dimensional, multimodal data such as social media, bioinformatics or recommendation systems. Existing Multi-View Multi-Label Feature Selection (MVMLFS) methods mainly focus on analyzing statistical information of data, but seldom consider semantic information. In this paper, we aim to use these two types of information jointly and propose a method that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) semantic reasoning with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) structural modeling for MVMLFS. Specifically, the method consists of three main components. (1) LLM is first used as an evaluation agent to assess the latent semantic relevance among feature, view, and label descriptions. (2) A semantic-aware heterogeneous graph with two levels is designed to represent relations among features, views and labels: one is a semantic graph representing semantic relations, and the other is a statistical graph. (3) A lightweight Graph Attention Network (GAT) is applied to learn node embedding in the heterogeneous graph as feature saliency scores for ranking and selection. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art baselines, and it is still effective when applied to small-scale datasets, showcasing its robustness, flexibility, and generalization ability.

Motivation: 探索LLMs是否真正具备数学理解能力，通过设计扰动实验来测试LLMs在复杂环境下的推理鲁棒性。

Method: 使用两种扰动方法：注入语义无关的扰动句子（逐步增加强度）和核心提问指令缺失，分析LLMs的问题解决机制。

Result: LLMs在面对无数字扰动时表现稳定但有鲁棒性边界；面对含数字扰动时性能显著下降（开源模型下降10%以上，最大下降51.55%，商业模型下降3%-10%）；在核心指令缺失时仍能保持20%-40%准确率。

Conclusion: LLMs对含数字信息的扰动更敏感，可能依赖记忆模板而非逻辑推理，揭示了当前LLMs推理能力的局限性和缺陷。

Abstract: LLMs have made significant progress in the field of mathematical reasoning, but whether they have true the mathematical understanding ability is still controversial. To explore this issue, we propose a new perturbation framework to evaluate LLMs' reasoning ability in complex environments by injecting additional semantically irrelevant perturbation sentences and gradually increasing the perturbation intensity. At the same time, we use an additional perturbation method: core questioning instruction missing, to further analyze the LLMs' problem-solving mechanism. The experimental results show that LLMs perform stably when facing perturbation sentences without numbers, but there is also a robustness boundary. As the perturbation intensity increases, the performance exhibits varying degrees of decline; when facing perturbation sentences with numbers, the performance decreases more significantly, most open source models with smaller parameters decrease by nearly or even more than 10%, and further increasing with the enhancement of perturbation intensity, with the maximum decrease reaching 51.55%. Even the most advanced commercial LLMs have seen a 3%-10% performance drop. By analyzing the reasoning process of LLMs in detail, We find that models are more sensitive to perturbations with numerical information and are more likely to give incorrect answers when disturbed by irrelevant numerical information. The higher the perturbation intensity, the more obvious these defects are. At the same time, in the absence of core questioning instruction, models can still maintain an accuracy of 20%-40%, indicating that LLMs may rely on memory templates or pattern matching to complete the task, rather than logical reasoning. In general, our work reveals the shortcomings and limitations of current LLMs in their reasoning capabilities, which is of great significance for the further development of LLMs.

Abstract: Understanding complex biomolecular mechanisms requires multi-step reasoning across molecular interactions, signaling cascades, and metabolic pathways. While large language models(LLMs) show promise in such tasks, their application to biomolecular problems is hindered by logical inconsistencies and the lack of grounding in domain knowledge. Existing approaches often exacerbate these issues: reasoning steps may deviate from biological facts or fail to capture long mechanistic dependencies. To address these challenges, we propose a Knowledge-Augmented Long-CoT Reasoning framework that integrates LLMs with knowledge graph-based multi-hop reasoning chains. The framework constructs mechanistic chains via guided multi-hop traversal and pruning on the knowledge graph; these chains are then incorporated into supervised fine-tuning to improve factual grounding and further refined with reinforcement learning to enhance reasoning reliability and consistency. Furthermore, to overcome the shortcomings of existing benchmarks, which are often restricted in scale and scope and lack annotations for deep reasoning chains, we introduce PrimeKGQA, a comprehensive benchmark for biomolecular question answering. Experimental results on both PrimeKGQA and existing datasets demonstrate that although larger closed-source models still perform well on relatively simple tasks, our method demonstrates clear advantages as reasoning depth increases, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multi-hop tasks that demand traversal of structured biological knowledge. These findings highlight the effectiveness of combining structured knowledge with advanced reasoning strategies for reliable and interpretable biomolecular reasoning.

TL;DR: KAMI v0.1是一个面向企业的代理AI基准测试，解决了传统LLM基准测试的数据污染问题，并评估代理能力如多步骤工具使用和不确定性决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业采用代理AI系统需要可靠的评估方法，而传统LLM基准测试存在训练数据污染问题，且无法衡量代理能力。

Method: 通过处理170,000个LLM测试项，处理超过55亿个token，涵盖35种模型配置，开发了KAMI v0.1基准测试。

Result: 传统基准测试排名无法准确预测实际代理性能，新一代模型在企业相关任务中并不总是优于旧版本，发现了成本-性能权衡和推理能力对token效率的影响。

Conclusion: KAMI v0.1为企业部署决策提供了关键见解，包括成本-性能权衡、模型特定行为模式以及推理能力对效率的影响。

Abstract: Enterprise adoption of agentic AI systems requires reliable evaluation methods that reflect real-world deployment scenarios. Traditional LLM benchmarks suffer from training data contamination and fail to measure agentic capabilities such as multi-step tool use and decision-making under uncertainty. We present the Kamiwaza Agentic Merit Index (KAMI) v0.1, an enterprise-focused benchmark that addresses both contamination resistance and agentic evaluation. Through 170,000 LLM test items processing over 5.5 billion tokens across 35 model configurations, we demonstrate that traditional benchmark rankings poorly predict practical agentic performance. Notably, newer generation models like Llama 4 or Qwen 3 do not always outperform their older generation variants on enterprise-relevant tasks, contradicting traditional benchmark trends. We also present insights on cost-performance tradeoffs, model-specific behavioral patterns, and the impact of reasoning capabilities on token efficiency -- findings critical for enterprises making deployment decisions.

Motivation: 现有LLM在推理步骤的复杂度和计算效率平衡方面存在不足，缺乏对System 2推理的深入探索，需要借鉴心理学理论优化认知路径。

Method: 提出心理学的Scaffold Reasoning框架，包含三个流：支架流构建参考代码，分析流分析错误代码，集成流整合两者结果。

Result: 在DebugBench上达到88.91%通过率和5.36秒平均推理时间，优于其他推理方法，在不同问题难度和错误类型上表现出优势。

Conclusion: 该框架与人类认知过程一致，在推理准确性和效率方面均优于现有方法，为优化LLM推理提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Recent LLMs have demonstrated sophisticated problem-solving capabilities on various benchmarks through advanced reasoning algorithms. However, the key research question of identifying reasoning steps that balance complexity and computational efficiency remains unsolved. Recent research has increasingly drawn upon psychological theories to explore strategies for optimizing cognitive pathways. The LLM's final outputs and intermediate steps are regarded as System 1 and System 2, respectively. However, an in-depth exploration of the System 2 reasoning is still lacking. Therefore, we propose a novel psychologically backed Scaffold Reasoning framework for code debugging, which encompasses the Scaffold Stream, Analytic Stream, and Integration Stream. The construction of reference code within the Scaffold Stream is integrated with the buggy code analysis results produced by the Analytic Stream through the Integration Stream. Our framework achieves an 88.91% pass rate and an average inference time of 5.36 seconds per-problem on DebugBench, outperforming other reasoning approaches across various LLMs in both reasoning accuracy and efficiency. Further analyses elucidate the advantages and limitations of various cognitive pathways across varying problem difficulties and bug types. Our findings also corroborate the alignment of the proposed Scaffold Reasoning framework with human cognitive processes.

*Zhishen Sun,Guang Dai,Haishan Ye*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出MSCR方法，通过多源候选替换对LLMs进行数学推理的对抗攻击，发现轻微扰动可显著降低模型准确率并增加计算资源消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在数学推理任务中表现接近人类水平，但其在轻微输入扰动下的鲁棒性缺乏系统研究，现有方法存在可扩展性有限、语义保持弱和成本高等问题。

Method: 基于多源候选替换的自动对抗攻击方法，结合LLMs嵌入空间的余弦相似度、WordNet词典和掩码语言模型的上下文预测，为输入问题中的每个单词生成语义相似候选词，经过过滤后逐一替换进行攻击。

Result: 在GSM8K和MATH500基准测试中，即使仅替换单个单词的轻微扰动也能显著降低所有模型的准确率，最大降幅分别达到49.89%和35.40%，同时保持扰动问题的高语义一致性。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在数学推理任务中存在鲁棒性缺陷和效率瓶颈，轻微扰动不仅导致错误输出，还大幅增加响应长度，产生更多冗余推理路径和更高的计算资源消耗。

Abstract: LLMs demonstrate performance comparable to human abilities in complex tasks such as mathematical reasoning, but their robustness in mathematical reasoning under minor input perturbations still lacks systematic investigation. Existing methods generally suffer from limited scalability, weak semantic preservation, and high costs. Therefore, we propose MSCR, an automated adversarial attack method based on multi-source candidate replacement. By combining three information sources including cosine similarity in the embedding space of LLMs, the WordNet dictionary, and contextual predictions from a masked language model, we generate for each word in the input question a set of semantically similar candidates, which are then filtered and substituted one by one to carry out the attack. We conduct large-scale experiments on LLMs using the GSM8K and MATH500 benchmarks. The results show that even a slight perturbation involving only a single word can significantly reduce the accuracy of all models, with the maximum drop reaching 49.89% on GSM8K and 35.40% on MATH500, while preserving the high semantic consistency of the perturbed questions. Further analysis reveals that perturbations not only lead to incorrect outputs but also substantially increase the average response length, which results in more redundant reasoning paths and higher computational resource consumption. These findings highlight the robustness deficiencies and efficiency bottlenecks of current LLMs in mathematical reasoning tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出信息容量作为衡量LLM效率的统一指标，基于文本压缩性能与计算复杂度的关系，能够公平比较不同模型系列的效率并预测同一系列内的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM的快速发展和广泛应用，计算资源需求激增，测试时扩展进一步加剧了模型能力与资源消耗之间的矛盾。目前缺乏一个能够准确反映不同规模和架构LLM效率的统一指标。

Method: 基于压缩与智能之间的相关性，引入信息容量指标，通过文本压缩性能相对于计算复杂度的比值来衡量模型效率。对49个主流开源模型在5个异构数据集上进行实证评估。

Result: 实证评估表明，同一系列中不同规模的模型具有一致的信息容量。该指标能够公平比较不同模型系列的效率，并准确预测同一系列内的性能。信息容量还考虑了分词器效率的影响。

Conclusion: 信息容量是一个有效的LLM效率评估指标，能够统一比较不同模型系列，并揭示了分词器效率、预训练数据和专家混合架构对模型效率的影响。

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the rapid advancements of large language models (LLMs) and their expanding applications, leading to soaring demands for computational resources. The widespread adoption of test-time scaling further aggravates the tension between model capability and resource consumption, highlighting the importance of inference efficiency. However, a unified metric that accurately reflects an LLM's efficiency across different model sizes and architectures remains absent. Motivated by the correlation between compression and intelligence, we introduce information capacity, a measure of model efficiency based on text compression performance relative to computational complexity. Larger models can predict the next token more accurately, achieving greater compression gains but at higher computational costs. Empirical evaluations on mainstream open-source models show that models of varying sizes within a series exhibit consistent information capacity. This metric enables a fair efficiency comparison across model series and accurate performance prediction within a model series. A distinctive feature of information capacity is that it incorporates tokenizer efficiency, which affects both input and output token counts but is often neglected in LLM evaluations. We assess the information capacity of 49 models on 5 heterogeneous datasets and observe consistent results on the influences of tokenizer efficiency, pretraining data, and the mixture-of-experts architecture.

Abstract: Multivariate time series data come as a collection of time series describing different aspects of a certain temporal phenomenon. Anomaly detection in this type of data constitutes a challenging problem yet with numerous applications in science and engineering because anomaly scores come from the simultaneous consideration of the temporal and variable relationships. In this paper, we propose a clustering-based approach to detect anomalies concerning the amplitude and the shape of multivariate time series. First, we use a sliding window to generate a set of multivariate subsequences and thereafter apply an extended fuzzy clustering to reveal a structure present within the generated multivariate subsequences. Finally, a reconstruction criterion is employed to reconstruct the multivariate subsequences with the optimal cluster centers and the partition matrix. We construct a confidence index to quantify a level of anomaly detected in the series and apply Particle Swarm Optimization as an optimization vehicle for the problem of anomaly detection. Experimental studies completed on several synthetic and six real-world datasets suggest that the proposed methods can detect the anomalies in multivariate time series. With the help of available clusters revealed by the extended fuzzy clustering, the proposed framework can detect anomalies in the multivariate time series and is suitable for identifying anomalous amplitude and shape patterns in various application domains such as health care, weather data analysis, finance, and disease outbreak detection.

*Stella C. Dong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文开发了一个评估再保险中大型语言模型可靠性的审慎框架，包含治理、数据溯源、保证、韧性和监管一致性五大支柱，通过RAIRAB基准评估LLM是否满足审慎标准。

Motivation: 将Solvency II、SR 11-7等监管期望转化为可衡量的生命周期控制，确保LLM在再保险应用中的可靠性。

Method: 采用五支柱架构（治理、数据溯源、保证、韧性、监管一致性），通过RAIRAB基准评估治理嵌入的LLM是否满足基础性、透明度和问责制的审慎标准。

Result: 在六个任务系列中，检索基础配置实现了更高的基础准确性（0.90），幻觉和解释漂移减少约40%，透明度几乎翻倍。

Conclusion: 当治理明确、数据可追溯且保证可验证时，现有的审慎原则已经能够容纳可靠的AI，这些机制降低了风险转移和资本配置中的信息摩擦。

Abstract: This paper develops a prudential framework for assessing the reliability of large language models (LLMs) in reinsurance. A five-pillar architecture--governance, data lineage, assurance, resilience, and regulatory alignment--translates supervisory expectations from Solvency II, SR 11-7, and guidance from EIOPA (2025), NAIC (2023), and IAIS (2024) into measurable lifecycle controls. The framework is implemented through the Reinsurance AI Reliability and Assurance Benchmark (RAIRAB), which evaluates whether governance-embedded LLMs meet prudential standards for grounding, transparency, and accountability. Across six task families, retrieval-grounded configurations achieved higher grounding accuracy (0.90), reduced hallucination and interpretive drift by roughly 40%, and nearly doubled transparency. These mechanisms lower informational frictions in risk transfer and capital allocation, showing that existing prudential doctrines already accommodate reliable AI when governance is explicit, data are traceable, and assurance is verifiable.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pearl因果层次结构的可满足性问题在几乎所有经典设置中都是计算难解的，需要寻找新的可处理性途径。

Method: 采用参数化复杂度方法，利用原始树宽和变量数量等参数，开发了新的算法工具包，基于结构良好的因果模型的特征而非传统的动态规划方法。

Result: 为关键概率和反事实片段提供了固定参数和XP算法，并给出了匹配的硬度结果来界定可处理性的界限。

Conclusion: 通过参数化复杂度方法为因果推理提供了新的算法工具包，突破了传统动态规划方法的局限，首次实现了Pearl因果层次结构可满足性问题的可处理性。

Abstract: Pearl's Causal Hierarchy (PCH) is a central framework for reasoning about probabilistic, interventional, and counterfactual statements, yet the satisfiability problem for PCH formulas is computationally intractable in almost all classical settings. We revisit this challenge through the lens of parameterized complexity and identify the first gateways to tractability. Our results include fixed-parameter and XP-algorithms for satisfiability in key probabilistic and counterfactual fragments, using parameters such as primal treewidth and the number of variables, together with matching hardness results that map the limits of tractability. Technically, we depart from the dynamic programming paradigm typically employed for treewidth-based algorithms and instead exploit structural characterizations of well-formed causal models, providing a new algorithmic toolkit for causal reasoning.

Conclusion: 该方法提高了AI驱动质量控制的可行性，特别适用于传感器能力有限的工业环境，为制造业中更高效和可解释的机器学习应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: Machine learning is an essential tool for optimizing industrial quality control processes. However, the complexity of machine learning models often limits their practical applicability due to a lack of interpretability. Additionally, many industrial machines lack comprehensive sensor technology, making data acquisition incomplete and challenging. Explainable Artificial Intelligence offers a solution by providing insights into model decision-making and identifying the most relevant features for classification. In this paper, we investigate the impact of feature reduction using XAI techniques on the quality classification of injection-molded parts. We apply SHAP, Grad-CAM, and LIME to analyze feature importance in a Long Short-Term Memory model trained on real production data. By reducing the original 19 input features to 9 and 6, we evaluate the trade-off between model accuracy, inference speed, and interpretability. Our results show that reducing features can improve generalization while maintaining high classification performance, with an small increase in inference speed. This approach enhances the feasibility of AI-driven quality control, particularly for industrial settings with limited sensor capabilities, and paves the way for more efficient and interpretable machine learning applications in manufacturing.

Abstract: Machine learning has significant potential for optimizing various industrial processes. However, data acquisition remains a major challenge as it is both time-consuming and costly. Synthetic data offers a promising solution to augment insufficient data sets and improve the robustness of machine learning models. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of incorporating synthetic data into the training process of the injection molding process using an existing Long Short-Term Memory architecture. Our approach is to generate synthetic data by simulating production cycles and incorporating them into the training data set. Through iterative experimentation with different proportions of synthetic data, we attempt to find an optimal balance that maximizes the benefits of synthetic data while preserving the authenticity and relevance of real data. Our results suggest that the inclusion of synthetic data improves the model's ability to handle different scenarios, with potential practical industrial applications to reduce manual labor, machine use, and material waste. This approach provides a valuable alternative for situations where extensive data collection and maintenance has been impractical or costly and thus could contribute to more efficient manufacturing processes in the future.

Conclusion: SpeechCARE在认知障碍检测方面表现出色，未来工作包括在现实护理环境中部署和针对纽约市代表性不足人群的EHR集成可解释性。

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) affect one in five adults over 60, yet more than half of individuals with cognitive decline remain undiagnosed. Speech-based assessments show promise for early detection, as phonetic motor planning deficits alter acoustic features (e.g., pitch, tone), while memory and language impairments lead to syntactic and semantic errors. However, conventional speech-processing pipelines with hand-crafted features or general-purpose audio classifiers often exhibit limited performance and generalizability. To address these limitations, we introduce SpeechCARE, a multimodal speech processing pipeline that leverages pretrained, multilingual acoustic and linguistic transformer models to capture subtle speech-related cues associated with cognitive impairment. Inspired by the Mixture of Experts (MoE) paradigm, SpeechCARE employs a dynamic fusion architecture that weights transformer-based acoustic, linguistic, and demographic inputs, allowing integration of additional modalities (e.g., social factors, imaging) and enhancing robustness across diverse tasks. Its robust preprocessing includes automatic transcription, large language model (LLM)-based anomaly detection, and task identification. A SHAP-based explainability module and LLM reasoning highlight each modality's contribution to decision-making. SpeechCARE achieved AUC = 0.88 and F1 = 0.72 for classifying cognitively healthy, MCI, and AD individuals, with AUC = 0.90 and F1 = 0.62 for MCI detection. Bias analysis showed minimal disparities, except for adults over 80. Mitigation techniques included oversampling and weighted loss. Future work includes deployment in real-world care settings (e.g., VNS Health, Columbia ADRC) and EHR-integrated explainability for underrepresented populations in New York City.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have enabled AI systems to achieve expert-level performance on domain-specific scientific tasks, yet these systems remain narrow and handcrafted. We introduce SciAgent, a unified multi-agent system designed for generalistic scientific reasoning-the ability to adapt reasoning strategies across disciplines and difficulty levels. SciAgent organizes problem solving as a hierarchical process: a Coordinator Agent interprets each problem's domain and complexity, dynamically orchestrating specialized Worker Systems, each composed of interacting reasoning Sub-agents for symbolic deduction, conceptual modeling, numerical computation, and verification. These agents collaboratively assemble and refine reasoning pipelines tailored to each task. Across mathematics and physics Olympiads (IMO, IMC, IPhO, CPhO), SciAgent consistently attains or surpasses human gold-medalist performance, demonstrating both domain generality and reasoning adaptability. Additionally, SciAgent has been tested on the International Chemistry Olympiad (IChO) and selected problems from the Humanity's Last Exam (HLE) benchmark, further confirming the system's ability to generalize across diverse scientific domains. This work establishes SciAgent as a concrete step toward generalistic scientific intelligence-AI systems capable of coherent, cross-disciplinary reasoning at expert levels.

Abstract: Visual grounding is the task of localising image regions from natural language queries and is critical for reasoning capable Graphical User Interface agents. Many existing methods rely on massive, noisy synthetic datasets.This work introduces an efficient training pipeline that combines model-based data filtering with parameter-efficient fine-tuning. From 4.8M synthetic examples, 12K clean and diverse instances are curated by first identifying challenging cases, removing misaligned and then selecting a diverse set of multimodal instances. On this data, a 3B-parameter Vision-Language Model is trained under three regimes: supervised fine-tuning, chain-of-thought- augmented fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization. Models trained with the filtered data and lightweight training strategies match or surpass larger baselines on benchmarks such as ScreenSpot, Multimodal-Mind2Web, and AndroidControl. These results demonstrate that principled data curation and robust adaptation can rival large-scale training, enabling compact yet capable multimodal reasoning agents.

Conclusion: 提出的贝叶斯误差最大化方法为构建不可学习样本提供了理论保证和实际有效性，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: The recent success of machine learning models, especially large-scale classifiers and language models, relies heavily on training with massive data. These data are often collected from online sources. This raises serious concerns about the protection of user data, as individuals may not have given consent for their data to be used in training. To address this concern, recent studies introduce the concept of unlearnable examples, i.e., data instances that appear natural but are intentionally altered to prevent models from effectively learning from them. While existing methods demonstrate empirical effectiveness, they typically rely on heuristic trials and lack formal guarantees. Besides, when unlearnable examples are mixed with clean data, as is often the case in practice, their unlearnability disappears. In this work, we propose a novel approach to constructing unlearnable examples by systematically maximising the Bayes error, a measurement of irreducible classification error. We develop an optimisation-based approach and provide an efficient solution using projected gradient ascent. Our method provably increases the Bayes error and remains effective when the unlearning examples are mixed with clean samples. Experimental results across multiple datasets and model architectures are consistent with our theoretical analysis and show that our approach can restrict data learnability, effectively in practice.

Abstract: Structured Electronic Health Record (EHR) data stores patient information in relational tables and plays a central role in clinical decision-making. Recent advances have explored the use of large language models (LLMs) to process such data, showing promise across various clinical tasks.However, the absence of standardized evaluation frameworks and clearly defined tasks makes it difficult to systematically assess and compare LLM performance on structured EHR data.To address these evaluation challenges, we introduce EHRStruct, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs on structured EHR tasks.EHRStruct defines 11 representative tasks spanning diverse clinical needs and includes 2,200 task-specific evaluation samples derived from two widely used EHR datasets.We use EHRStruct to evaluate 20 advanced and representative LLMs, covering both general and medical models.We further analyze key factors influencing model performance, including input formats, few-shot generalisation, and finetuning strategies, and compare results with 11 state-of-the-art LLM-based enhancement methods for structured data reasoning. Our results indicate that many structured EHR tasks place high demands on the understanding and reasoning capabilities of LLMs.In response, we propose EHRMaster, a code-augmented method that achieves state-of-the-art performance and offers practical

Abstract: Hit identification is a central challenge in early drug discovery, traditionally requiring substantial experimental resources. Recent advances in artificial intelligence, particularly large language models (LLMs), have enabled virtual screening methods that reduce costs and improve efficiency. However, the growing complexity of these tools has limited their accessibility to wet-lab researchers. Multi-agent systems offer a promising solution by combining the interpretability of LLMs with the precision of specialized models and tools. In this work, we present MADD, a multi-agent system that builds and executes customized hit identification pipelines from natural language queries. MADD employs four coordinated agents to handle key subtasks in de novo compound generation and screening. We evaluate MADD across seven drug discovery cases and demonstrate its superior performance compared to existing LLM-based solutions. Using MADD, we pioneer the application of AI-first drug design to five biological targets and release the identified hit molecules. Finally, we introduce a new benchmark of query-molecule pairs and docking scores for over three million compounds to contribute to the agentic future of drug design.

*Zhihao Lin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Geometric Action Control (GAC)方法，通过方向向量和可学习集中参数分解动作生成，在保持球面分布几何优势的同时简化计算，在连续控制任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高斯策略在连续控制中由于无界支持需要临时压缩函数而扭曲有界动作空间几何的问题，同时避免vMF分布依赖贝塞尔函数和拒绝采样的计算复杂性。

Method: GAC将动作生成分解为方向向量和可学习集中参数，实现确定性动作和均匀球面噪声之间的高效插值，参数数量从2d减少到d+1，计算复杂度从O(dk)降低到O(d)。

Result: 在六个MuJoCo基准测试中一致匹配或超越最先进方法，在Ant-v4上比SAC提高37.6%，在4/6任务中获得最佳结果。消融研究表明球面归一化和自适应集中控制对GAC成功至关重要。

Conclusion: 稳健高效的连续控制不需要复杂分布，而是需要对动作空间几何的有原则尊重。

Abstract: Gaussian policies have dominated continuous control in deep reinforcement learning (RL), yet they suffer from a fundamental mismatch: their unbounded support requires ad-hoc squashing functions that distort the geometry of bounded action spaces. While von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distributions offer a theoretically grounded alternative on the sphere, their reliance on Bessel functions and rejection sampling hinders practical adoption. We propose \textbf{Geometric Action Control (GAC)}, a novel action generation paradigm that preserves the geometric benefits of spherical distributions while \textit{simplifying computation}. GAC decomposes action generation into a direction vector and a learnable concentration parameter, enabling efficient interpolation between deterministic actions and uniform spherical noise. This design reduces parameter count from \(2d\) to \(d+1\), and avoids the \(O(dk)\) complexity of vMF rejection sampling, achieving simple \(O(d)\) operations. Empirically, GAC consistently matches or exceeds state-of-the-art methods across six MuJoCo benchmarks, achieving 37.6\% improvement over SAC on Ant-v4 and the best results on 4 out of 6 tasks. Our ablation studies reveal that both \textbf{spherical normalization} and \textbf{adaptive concentration control} are essential to GAC's success. These findings suggest that robust and efficient continuous control does not require complex distributions, but a principled respect for the geometry of action spaces. Code and pretrained models are available in supplementary materials.

Motivation: 当前基于基础设施指标（如延迟、吞吐量）的AI智能体评估方法无法捕捉决策质量、运营自主性和业务价值，需要更全面的评估框架。

Method: 提出了11个任务无关的性能指标，包括目标完成率、自主性指数、多步骤任务韧性等，并通过涉及4种智能体架构和5个领域的大规模模拟实验进行验证。

Result: 混合智能体在大多数指标上表现最佳，平均目标完成率达到88.8%，投资回报率最高，揭示了不同智能体设计之间的性能权衡。

Conclusion: 该工作为AI智能体的整体评估提供了标准化方法，有助于更有效的开发、部署和治理。

Abstract: As AI agents proliferate across industries and applications, evaluating their performance based solely on infrastructural metrics such as latency, time-to-first-token, or token throughput is proving insufficient. These metrics fail to capture the quality of an agent's decisions, its operational autonomy, or its ultimate business value. This white paper proposes a novel, comprehensive framework of eleven outcome-based, task-agnostic performance metrics for AI agents that transcend domain boundaries. These metrics are designed to enable organizations to evaluate agents based on the quality of their decisions, their degree of autonomy, their adaptability to new challenges, and the tangible business value they deliver, regardless of the underlying model architecture or specific use case. We introduce metrics such as Goal Completion Rate (GCR), Autonomy Index (AIx), Multi-Step Task Resilience (MTR), and Business Impact Efficiency (BIE). Through a large-scale simulated experiment involving four distinct agent architectures (ReAct, Chain-of-Thought, Tool-Augmented, Hybrid) across five diverse domains (Healthcare, Finance, Marketing, Legal, and Customer Service), we demonstrate the framework's efficacy. Our results reveal significant performance trade-offs between different agent designs, highlighting the Hybrid Agent as the most consistently high-performing model across the majority of our proposed metrics, achieving an average Goal Completion Rate of 88.8\% and the highest Return on Investment (ROI). This work provides a robust, standardized methodology for the holistic evaluation of AI agents, paving the way for more effective development, deployment, and governance.

Conclusion: STV框架通过敏感性感知的任务向量插入，有效解决了多模态模型少样本学习中的扩展问题，为任务向量方法提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have shown promising in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, but scaling to many-shot settings remains difficult due to limited context length and high inference cost. To address these challenges, task-vector-based methods have been explored by inserting compact representations of many-shot in-context demonstrations into model activations. However, existing task-vector-based methods either overlook the importance of where to insert task vectors or struggle to determine suitable values for each location. To this end, we propose a novel Sensitivity-aware Task Vector insertion framework (STV) to figure out where and what to insert. Our key insight is that activation deltas across query-context pairs exhibit consistent structural patterns, providing a reliable cue for insertion. Based on the identified sensitive-aware locations, we construct a pre-clustered activation bank for each location by clustering the activation values, and then apply reinforcement learning to choose the most suitable one to insert. We evaluate STV across a range of multimodal models (e.g., Qwen-VL, Idefics-2) and tasks (e.g., VizWiz, OK-VQA), demonstrating its effectiveness and showing consistent improvements over previous task-vector-based methods with strong generalization.

Conclusion: 该方法能够将AI与现实世界应用规模化连接，支持工业数字自动化用例，展示了标签属性图在GraphRAG中的实用价值。

Abstract: While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods commonly draw information from unstructured documents, the emerging paradigm of GraphRAG aims to leverage structured data such as knowledge graphs. Most existing GraphRAG efforts focus on Resource Description Framework (RDF) knowledge graphs, relying on triple representations and SPARQL queries. However, the potential of Cypher and Labeled Property Graph (LPG) databases to serve as scalable and effective reasoning engines within GraphRAG pipelines remains underexplored in current research literature. To fill this gap, we propose Multi-Agent GraphRAG, a modular LLM agentic system for text-to-Cypher query generation serving as a natural language interface to LPG-based graph data. Our proof-of-concept system features an LLM-based workflow for automated Cypher queries generation and execution, using Memgraph as the graph database backend. Iterative content-aware correction and normalization, reinforced by an aggregated feedback loop, ensures both semantic and syntactic refinement of generated queries. We evaluate our system on the CypherBench graph dataset covering several general domains with diverse types of queries. In addition, we demonstrate performance of the proposed workflow on a property graph derived from the IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) data, representing a digital twin of a building. This highlights how such an approach can bridge AI with real-world applications at scale, enabling industrial digital automation use cases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs越来越多地用于学习工具，但大多数工具仅限于文本，限制了在数学等需要可视化的领域的实用性。虽然LLMs能够生成编译成教育图形的代码，但主要瓶颈在于对这些图表的可扩展评估。

Method: 提出DiagramIR评估管道，利用LaTeX TikZ代码的中间表示(IRs)来自动评估几何图形。

Result: 该方法与人类评估者的一致性高于LLM-as-a-Judge等基线方法，且能让GPT-4.1-Mini等小模型以10倍更低的推理成本达到GPT-5等大模型的性能水平。

Conclusion: DiagramIR为部署可访问和可扩展的教育技术提供了重要的评估方法，特别是对于需要视觉化的学习领域。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being adopted as tools for learning; however, most tools remain text-only, limiting their usefulness for domains where visualizations are essential, such as mathematics. Recent work shows that LLMs are capable of generating code that compiles to educational figures, but a major bottleneck remains: scalable evaluation of these diagrams. We address this by proposing DiagramIR: an automatic and scalable evaluation pipeline for geometric figures. Our method relies on intermediate representations (IRs) of LaTeX TikZ code. We compare our pipeline to other evaluation baselines such as LLM-as-a-Judge, showing that our approach has higher agreement with human raters. This evaluation approach also enables smaller models like GPT-4.1-Mini to perform comparably to larger models such as GPT-5 at a 10x lower inference cost, which is important for deploying accessible and scalable education technologies.

Conclusion: Spark架构有效解决了AI编程智能体缺乏共享知识库的问题，通过集体持续学习机制显著提升了代码生成质量，为智能体中心软件开发提供了可行的知识共享解决方案。

Abstract: The transition from human-centric to agent-centric software development practices is disrupting existing knowledge sharing environments for software developers. Traditional peer-to-peer repositories and developer communities for shared technical knowledge and best practice have witnessed dramatic drops in participation in a short period of time. At the same time, agentic functional equivalents are yet to emerge leaving AI agents, which already generate a significant proportion of all new software code produced, without access to repositories of valuable shared learning.
  In this paper, we introduce Spark, a novel shared agentic memory architecture which is designed to emulate the collective intelligence and know-how of human developer communities. Spark enables AI coding agents to both contribute to and draw from a persistent and continuously evolving experiential memory. Agents operating in the same general problem space use the Spark shared memory as a repository of new knowledge to achieve collective continual learning. We evaluate Spark as a coach for AI coding agents performing software development tasks. We demonstrate that recommendations made by Spark improve the quality of code generated by generic code generation models at varying sizes and capability tiers. Boosted by Spark, a small open-weights model with 30 billion parameters was able to match the code quality afforded by a much larger state-of-the-art model. Separately, we measure the intrinsic quality of recommendations generated by Spark against a wide range of criteria inspired by software development best practice, and achieve helpfulness levels of up to 98.2% in the top two (out of five) qualitative helpfulness bands.

Abstract: An AI-powered data visualization platform that automates the entire data analysis process, from uploading a dataset to generating an interactive visualization. Advanced machine learning algorithms are employed to clean and preprocess the data, analyse its features, and automatically select appropriate visualizations. The system establishes the process of automating AI-based analysis and visualization from the context of data-driven environments, and eliminates the challenge of time-consuming manual data analysis. The combination of a Python Flask backend to access the dataset, paired with a React frontend, provides a robust platform that automatically interacts with Firebase Cloud Storage for numerous data processing and data analysis solutions and real-time sources. Key contributions include automatic and intelligent data cleaning, with imputation for missing values, and detection of outliers, via analysis of the data set. AI solutions to intelligently select features, using four different algorithms, and intelligent title generation and visualization are determined by the attributes of the dataset. These contributions were evaluated using two separate datasets to assess the platform's performance. In the process evaluation, the initial analysis was performed in real-time on datasets as large as 100000 rows, while the cloud-based demand platform scales to meet requests from multiple users and processes them simultaneously. In conclusion, the cloud-based data visualization application allowed for a significant reduction of manual inputs to the data analysis process while maintaining a high quality, impactful visual outputs, and user experiences

Main category: cs.AI

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究将拒绝行为编码为潜在空间中的单一方向，但新兴证据表明概念在LLMs中通常以低维流形形式编码。本文旨在探索拒绝行为的多方向表示。

Method: 使用自组织映射(SOMs)在有害提示表示上训练以识别多个神经元，通过从每个神经元减去无害表示的质心来推导多个拒绝方向。

Result: 实验表明，从模型内部消融多个方向不仅优于单方向基线，还优于专门的越狱算法，能有效抑制拒绝行为。

Conclusion: 该方法揭示了拒绝机制的复杂多方向特性，为机制可解释性研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: Refusal refers to the functional behavior enabling safety-aligned language models to reject harmful or unethical prompts. Following the growing scientific interest in mechanistic interpretability, recent work encoded refusal behavior as a single direction in the model's latent space; e.g., computed as the difference between the centroids of harmful and harmless prompt representations. However, emerging evidence suggests that concepts in LLMs often appear to be encoded as a low-dimensional manifold embedded in the high-dimensional latent space. Motivated by these findings, we propose a novel method leveraging Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) to extract multiple refusal directions. To this end, we first prove that SOMs generalize the prior work's difference-in-means technique. We then train SOMs on harmful prompt representations to identify multiple neurons. By subtracting the centroid of harmless representations from each neuron, we derive a set of multiple directions expressing the refusal concept. We validate our method on an extensive experimental setup, demonstrating that ablating multiple directions from models' internals outperforms not only the single-direction baseline but also specialized jailbreak algorithms, leading to an effective suppression of refusal. Finally, we conclude by analyzing the mechanistic implications of our approach.

TL;DR: 提出了FaithEval评估框架和FaithAct规划框架，通过强制每个推理步骤的证据基础来改善多模态推理中的忠实性问题，在多个基准测试中感知忠实性提升达26%且不降低任务准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在推理过程中产生看似合理但缺乏依据的推理链的问题，区分行为忠实性（推理与输出对齐）和感知忠实性（推理与输入对齐）。

Method: 引入FaithEval量化步骤级和链级忠实性，评估每个声称对象是否得到视觉支持；提出FaithAct框架，在每一步推理中强制证据基础。

Result: 在多个推理基准测试中，FaithAct相比基于提示和工具增强的基线方法，感知忠实性提升高达26%，且不降低任务准确性。

Conclusion: 将忠实性作为指导原则不仅减轻幻觉问题，还产生更稳定的推理轨迹，为多模态推理中的忠实性评估和执行建立了统一框架。

Abstract: Unfaithfulness remains a persistent challenge for large language models (LLMs), which often produce plausible yet ungrounded reasoning chains that diverge from perceptual evidence or final conclusions. We distinguish between behavioral faithfulness (alignment between reasoning and output) and perceptual faithfulness (alignment between reasoning and input), and introduce FaithEval for quantifying step-level and chain-level faithfulness by evaluating whether each claimed object is visually supported by the image. Building on these insights, we propose FaithAct, a faithfulness-first planning and acting framework that enforces evidential grounding at every reasoning step. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that FaithAct improves perceptual faithfulness by up to 26% without degrading task accuracy compared to prompt-based and tool-augmented baselines. Our analysis shows that treating faithfulness as a guiding principle not only mitigates hallucination but also leads to more stable reasoning trajectories. This work thereby establishes a unified framework for both evaluating and enforcing faithfulness in multimodal reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM版本更新成本高、频率低且难以定制，导致已发布模型存在已知安全漏洞，需要更灵活高效的修复机制。

Method: 在现有模型前添加可学习的紧凑前缀作为"补丁"，仅引入极少额外参数，将模型行为引导至更安全的参考模型。

Result: 在毒性缓解、偏见减少和有害性拒绝三个关键领域，安全补丁实现了与下一代安全对齐模型相当的安全改进，同时保持流畅性。

Conclusion: LLM可以像软件一样打补丁，为供应商和从业者提供了在大版本更新之间分发可扩展、高效且可组合安全更新的实用机制。

Abstract: We propose patching for large language models (LLMs) like software versions, a lightweight and modular approach for addressing safety vulnerabilities. While vendors release improved LLM versions, major releases are costly, infrequent, and difficult to tailor to customer needs, leaving released models with known safety gaps. Unlike full-model fine-tuning or major version updates, our method enables rapid remediation by prepending a compact, learnable prefix to an existing model. This "patch" introduces only 0.003% additional parameters, yet reliably steers model behavior toward that of a safer reference model. Across three critical domains (toxicity mitigation, bias reduction, and harmfulness refusal) policy patches achieve safety improvements comparable to next-generation safety-aligned models while preserving fluency. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can be "patched" much like software, offering vendors and practitioners a practical mechanism for distributing scalable, efficient, and composable safety updates between major model releases.

Motivation: 随着AI系统（如LLMs）越来越多地参与数学研究和教育，理解它们与人类在数学问题趣味性和难度判断上的一致性变得重要。

Method: 通过两项实证研究，分别对众包平台参与者和国际数学奥林匹克竞赛选手进行调查，比较人类和LLMs对数学问题趣味性和难度的评估。

Result: LLMs在趣味性判断上大致与人类一致，但无法完全复制人类判断的分布模式，且与人类选择趣味性理由的相关性较弱。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在捕捉人类数学趣味性判断方面既有潜力也有局限，对于数学AI思维伙伴关系的发展具有重要意义。

Abstract: The evolution of mathematics has been guided in part by interestingness. From researchers choosing which problems to tackle next, to students deciding which ones to engage with, people's choices are often guided by judgments about how interesting or challenging problems are likely to be. As AI systems, such as LLMs, increasingly participate in mathematics with people -- whether for advanced research or education -- it becomes important to understand how well their judgments align with human ones. Our work examines this alignment through two empirical studies of human and LLM assessment of mathematical interestingness and difficulty, spanning a range of mathematical experience. We study two groups: participants from a crowdsourcing platform and International Math Olympiad competitors. We show that while many LLMs appear to broadly agree with human notions of interestingness, they mostly do not capture the distribution observed in human judgments. Moreover, most LLMs only somewhat align with why humans find certain math problems interesting, showing weak correlation with human-selected interestingness rationales. Together, our findings highlight both the promises and limitations of current LLMs in capturing human interestingness judgments for mathematical AI thought partnerships.

Motivation: 目标是开发一种具有高精度、高噪声鲁棒性、低延迟和低能耗的解码方法，为SNN提供更好的解码方案。

Method: 将脉冲神经网络与超维计算相结合，构建SNN-HDC模型进行解码。

Result: 在DvsGesture和SL-Animals-DVS数据集上，SNN-HDC模型实现了1.24x到3.67x的能耗降低，能够100%识别未训练类别样本，分类准确率和延迟表现均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法代表了比传统速率和延迟解码更具吸引力的替代方案，具有显著优势。

Abstract: This work presents a novel spiking neural network (SNN) decoding method, combining SNNs with Hyperdimensional computing (HDC). The goal is to create a decoding method with high accuracy, high noise robustness, low latency and low energy usage. Compared to analogous architectures decoded with existing approaches, the presented SNN-HDC model attains generally better classification accuracy, lower classification latency and lower estimated energy consumption on multiple test cases from literature. The SNN-HDC achieved estimated energy consumption reductions ranging from 1.24x to 3.67x on the DvsGesture dataset and from 1.38x to 2.27x on the SL-Animals-DVS dataset. The presented decoding method can also efficiently identify unknown classes it has not been trained on. In the DvsGesture dataset the SNN-HDC model can identify 100% of samples from an unseen/untrained class. Given the numerous benefits shown and discussed in this paper, this decoding method represents a very compelling alternative to both rate and latency decoding.

Abstract: Neurosymbolic (NeSy) AI aims to combine the strengths of neural architectures and symbolic reasoning to improve the accuracy, interpretability, and generalization capability of AI models. While logic inference on top of subsymbolic modules has been shown to effectively guarantee these properties, this often comes at the cost of reduced scalability, which can severely limit the usability of NeSy models. This paper introduces DeepProofLog (DPrL), a novel NeSy system based on stochastic logic programs, which addresses the scalability limitations of previous methods. DPrL parameterizes all derivation steps with neural networks, allowing efficient neural guidance over the proving system. Additionally, we establish a formal mapping between the resolution process of our deep stochastic logic programs and Markov Decision Processes, enabling the application of dynamic programming and reinforcement learning techniques for efficient inference and learning. This theoretical connection improves scalability for complex proof spaces and large knowledge bases. Our experiments on standard NeSy benchmarks and knowledge graph reasoning tasks demonstrate that DPrL outperforms existing state-of-the-art NeSy systems, advancing scalability to larger and more complex settings than previously possible.

Motivation: 视频生成领域正从生成视觉吸引力的片段转向构建支持交互和保持物理合理性的虚拟环境，这指向了视频基础模型作为隐式世界模型的发展方向。

Method: 将视频基础模型分解为两个核心组件：隐式世界模型（编码物理规律、交互动态和智能体行为知识）和视频渲染器（将潜在模拟转化为真实视觉观察）。通过四代发展历程分析模型能力的演进。

Result: 视频生成模型逐步发展出内在物理合理性、实时多模态交互和多时空尺度规划能力，最终形成具有世界模型特性的视频生成系统。

Conclusion: 视频基础模型正演化为能够模拟物理动态、智能体-环境交互和任务规划的隐式世界模型，为下一代世界模型的设计提供了重要参考，并强调了智能体智能在塑造和评估这些系统中的关键作用。

Abstract: The landscape of video generation is shifting, from a focus on generating visually appealing clips to building virtual environments that support interaction and maintain physical plausibility. These developments point toward the emergence of video foundation models that function not only as visual generators but also as implicit world models, models that simulate the physical dynamics, agent-environment interactions, and task planning that govern real or imagined worlds. This survey provides a systematic overview of this evolution, conceptualizing modern video foundation models as the combination of two core components: an implicit world model and a video renderer. The world model encodes structured knowledge about the world, including physical laws, interaction dynamics, and agent behavior. It serves as a latent simulation engine that enables coherent visual reasoning, long-term temporal consistency, and goal-driven planning. The video renderer transforms this latent simulation into realistic visual observations, effectively producing videos as a "window" into the simulated world. We trace the progression of video generation through four generations, in which the core capabilities advance step by step, ultimately culminating in a world model, built upon a video generation model, that embodies intrinsic physical plausibility, real-time multimodal interaction, and planning capabilities spanning multiple spatiotemporal scales. For each generation, we define its core characteristics, highlight representative works, and examine their application domains such as robotics, autonomous driving, and interactive gaming. Finally, we discuss open challenges and design principles for next-generation world models, including the role of agent intelligence in shaping and evaluating these systems. An up-to-date list of related works is maintained at this link.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度研究代理需要处理开放式查询，但现有评估方法难以应对其长篇幅、多样性和依赖动态信息源的特点，需要标准化评估基准。

Method: 构建ResearchRubrics基准，包含现实领域多样的提示和专家编写的评分标准；提出三维复杂度框架（概念广度、逻辑嵌套、探索性）；开发人工和模型评估协议。

Result: 评估多个最先进的DR系统，发现即使是领先的代理如Gemini DR和OpenAI DR，在评分标准合规性方面平均低于68%，主要问题是遗漏隐含上下文和对检索信息推理不足。

Conclusion: 需要强大、可扩展的深度研究能力评估方法，为此发布了ResearchRubrics基准以促进研究助手的发展。

Abstract: Deep Research (DR) is an emerging agent application that leverages large language models (LLMs) to address open-ended queries. It requires the integration of several capabilities, including multi-step reasoning, cross-document synthesis, and the generation of evidence-backed, long-form answers. Evaluating DR remains challenging because responses are lengthy and diverse, admit many valid solutions, and often depend on dynamic information sources. We introduce ResearchRubrics, a standardized benchmark for DR built with over 2,800+ hours of human labor that pairs realistic, domain-diverse prompts with 2,500+ expert-written, fine-grained rubrics to assess factual grounding, reasoning soundness, and clarity. We also propose a new complexity framework for categorizing DR tasks along three axes: conceptual breadth, logical nesting, and exploration. In addition, we develop human and model-based evaluation protocols that measure rubric adherence for DR agents. We evaluate several state-of-the-art DR systems and find that even leading agents like Gemini's DR and OpenAI's DR achieve under 68% average compliance with our rubrics, primarily due to missed implicit context and inadequate reasoning about retrieved information. Our results highlight the need for robust, scalable assessment of deep research capabilities, to which end we release ResearchRubrics(including all prompts, rubrics, and evaluation code) to facilitate progress toward well-justified research assistants.

Method: 使用两种图论模型和混合整数规划方法，计算不同火车车厢数量下的最优得分，分析最常选择的车票和路线。

Result: 45节火车车厢的最优得分为285分，识别出最常选择的车票和路线，发现多个需要调整分数以改善游戏平衡的实例。

Conclusion: 通过数学模型可以有效地分析游戏策略和平衡性，为游戏设计者提供数据支持来优化游戏体验。

Abstract: We give two graph-theoretic models and a mixed-integer program to calculate the maximum achievable score in the popular board game "Ticket to Ride." In Ticket to Ride, players compete to claim railway routes on a map, with points awarded based on the length of each route and the successful completion of destination tickets connecting specific city pairs. Each player has 45 train cars available, and each route can be chosen by only one player. Using the mixed-integer programming model, we examine the optimal solution with the 45 allocatable train cars, leading to an optimal score of 285 points. We also calculate the optimal solutions for up to 50 train cars. We determine the most frequently chosen tickets and routes over these 50 instances, giving insight into how optimization might be used to balance games. In particular, we identify several instances in which the point values can be adjusted to better balance the game.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决标准ReLU激活函数因硬零截断导致的神经元死亡问题，增强深度神经网络的优化鲁棒性。

Method: 提出N-ReLU激活函数，将负激活值替换为零均值高斯噪声，保持期望输出对齐，作为退火式正则化器。

Result: 在MNIST数据集上，N-ReLU在中等噪声水平（sigma=0.05-0.10）下达到与ReLU、LeakyReLU、PReLU、GELU和RReLU相当或略优的准确率，收敛稳定且无神经元死亡。

Conclusion: 轻量级高斯噪声注入是一种简单有效的机制，可在不修改网络结构或引入额外参数的情况下增强优化鲁棒性。

Abstract: Activation functions are fundamental for enabling nonlinear representations in deep neural networks. However, the standard rectified linear unit (ReLU) often suffers from inactive or "dead" neurons caused by its hard zero cutoff. To address this issue, we introduce N-ReLU (Noise-ReLU), a zero-mean stochastic extension of ReLU that replaces negative activations with Gaussian noise while preserving the same expected output. This expectation-aligned formulation maintains gradient flow in inactive regions and acts as an annealing-style regularizer during training. Experiments on the MNIST dataset using both multilayer perceptron (MLP) and convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures show that N-ReLU achieves accuracy comparable to or slightly exceeding that of ReLU, LeakyReLU, PReLU, GELU, and RReLU at moderate noise levels (sigma = 0.05-0.10), with stable convergence and no dead neurons observed. These results demonstrate that lightweight Gaussian noise injection offers a simple yet effective mechanism to enhance optimization robustness without modifying network structures or introducing additional parameters.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Financial institutions deploy Large Language Models (LLMs) for reconciliations, regulatory reporting, and client communications, but nondeterministic outputs (output drift) undermine auditability and trust. We quantify drift across five model architectures (7B-120B parameters) on regulated financial tasks, revealing a stark inverse relationship: smaller models (Granite-3-8B, Qwen2.5-7B) achieve 100% output consistency at T=0.0, while GPT-OSS-120B exhibits only 12.5% consistency (95% CI: 3.5-36.0%) regardless of configuration (p<0.0001, Fisher's exact test). This finding challenges conventional assumptions that larger models are universally superior for production deployment.
  Our contributions include: (i) a finance-calibrated deterministic test harness combining greedy decoding (T=0.0), fixed seeds, and SEC 10-K structure-aware retrieval ordering; (ii) task-specific invariant checking for RAG, JSON, and SQL outputs using finance-calibrated materiality thresholds (plus or minus 5%) and SEC citation validation; (iii) a three-tier model classification system enabling risk-appropriate deployment decisions; and (iv) an audit-ready attestation system with dual-provider validation.
  We evaluated five models (Qwen2.5-7B via Ollama, Granite-3-8B via IBM watsonx.ai, Llama-3.3-70B, Mistral-Medium-2505, and GPT-OSS-120B) across three regulated financial tasks. Across 480 runs (n=16 per condition), structured tasks (SQL) remain stable even at T=0.2, while RAG tasks show drift (25-75%), revealing task-dependent sensitivity. Cross-provider validation confirms deterministic behavior transfers between local and cloud deployments. We map our framework to Financial Stability Board (FSB), Bank for International Settlements (BIS), and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) requirements, demonstrating practical pathways for compliance-ready AI deployments.

TL;DR: 提出SPaCQL算法，通过部分动作替换策略缓解离线多智能体强化学习中的分布外问题，在因子化行为策略下提供更紧的价值误差界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线多智能体强化学习面临分布外联合动作评估的严重挑战，特别是在行为策略因子化的常见场景中。

Method: 开发Soft-Partial Conservative Q-Learning (SPaCQL)，使用部分动作替换策略缓解OOD问题，并根据价值估计不确定性动态加权不同PAR策略。

Result: 理论证明在因子化行为策略下，分布偏移随偏离智能体数量线性增长而非随联合动作空间指数增长，提供更紧的价值误差界。

Conclusion: SPaCQL能更有效地进行策略学习，在离线数据集呈现独立结构时显著优于基线算法。

Abstract: Offline multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is severely hampered by the challenge of evaluating out-of-distribution (OOD) joint actions. Our core finding is that when the behavior policy is factorized - a common scenario where agents act fully or partially independently during data collection - a strategy of partial action replacement (PAR) can significantly mitigate this challenge. PAR updates a single or part of agents' actions while the others remain fixed to the behavioral data, reducing distribution shift compared to full joint-action updates. Based on this insight, we develop Soft-Partial Conservative Q-Learning (SPaCQL), using PAR to mitigate OOD issue and dynamically weighting different PAR strategies based on the uncertainty of value estimation. We provide a rigorous theoretical foundation for this approach, proving that under factorized behavior policies, the induced distribution shift scales linearly with the number of deviating agents rather than exponentially with the joint-action space. This yields a provably tighter value error bound for this important class of offline MARL problems. Our theoretical results also indicate that SPaCQL adaptively addresses distribution shift using uncertainty-informed weights. Our empirical results demonstrate SPaCQL enables more effective policy learning, and manifest its remarkable superiority over baseline algorithms when the offline dataset exhibits the independence structure.

Conclusion: AdaTrip通过自适应图学习框架有效解决了多水库入流预测中的时空依赖问题，为水资源管理提供了更好的预测工具和决策支持。

Abstract: Reservoir inflow prediction is crucial for water resource management, yet existing approaches mainly focus on single-reservoir models that ignore spatial dependencies among interconnected reservoirs. We introduce AdaTrip as an adaptive, time-varying graph learning framework for multi-reservoir inflow forecasting. AdaTrip constructs dynamic graphs where reservoirs are nodes with directed edges reflecting hydrological connections, employing attention mechanisms to automatically identify crucial spatial and temporal dependencies. Evaluation on thirty reservoirs in the Upper Colorado River Basin demonstrates superiority over existing baselines, with improved performance for reservoirs with limited records through parameter sharing. Additionally, AdaTrip provides interpretable attention maps at edge and time-step levels, offering insights into hydrological controls to support operational decision-making.

Abstract: Effective crime linkage analysis is crucial for identifying serial offenders and enhancing public safety. To address limitations of traditional crime linkage methods in handling high-dimensional, sparse, and heterogeneous data, we propose a Siamese Autoencoder framework that learns meaningful latent representations and uncovers correlations in complex crime data. Using data from the Violent Crime Linkage Analysis System (ViCLAS), maintained by the Serious Crime Analysis Section of the UK's National Crime Agency, our approach mitigates signal dilution in sparse feature spaces by integrating geographic-temporal features at the decoder stage. This design amplifies behavioral representations rather than allowing them to be overshadowed at the input level, yielding consistent improvements across multiple evaluation metrics. We further analyze how different domain-informed data reduction strategies influence model performance, providing practical guidance for preprocessing in crime linkage contexts. Our results show that advanced machine learning approaches can substantially enhance linkage accuracy, improving AUC by up to 9% over traditional methods while offering interpretable insights to support investigative decision-making.

Abstract: Enterprise relational databases increasingly contain vast amounts of non-semantic data - IP addresses, product identifiers, encoded keys, and timestamps - that challenge traditional semantic analysis. This paper introduces a novel Character-Level Autoencoder (CAE) approach that automatically identifies and groups semantically identical columns in non-semantic relational datasets by detecting column similarities based on data patterns and structures. Unlike conventional Natural Language Processing (NLP) models that struggle with limitations in semantic interpretability and out-of-vocabulary tokens, our approach operates at the character level with fixed dictionary constraints, enabling scalable processing of large-scale data lakes and warehouses. The CAE architecture encodes text representations of non-semantic relational table columns and extracts high-dimensional feature embeddings for data grouping. By maintaining a fixed dictionary size, our method significantly reduces both memory requirements and training time, enabling efficient processing of large-scale industrial data environments. Experimental evaluation demonstrates substantial performance gains: our CAE approach achieved 80.95% accuracy in top 5 column matching tasks across relational datasets, substantially outperforming traditional NLP approaches such as Bag of Words (47.62%). These results demonstrate its effectiveness for identifying and clustering identical columns in relational datasets. This work bridges the gap between theoretical advances in character-level neural architectures and practical enterprise data management challenges, providing an automated solution for schema understanding and data profiling of non-semantic industrial datasets at scale.

Conclusion: ZeroSim展示了在模拟电路设计自动化任务中的实际价值，能够高效准确地评估电路性能。

Abstract: Although recent advancements in learning-based analog circuit design automation have tackled tasks such as topology generation, device sizing, and layout synthesis, efficient performance evaluation remains a major bottleneck. Traditional SPICE simulations are time-consuming, while existing machine learning methods often require topology-specific retraining or manual substructure segmentation for fine-tuning, hindering scalability and adaptability. In this work, we propose ZeroSim, a transformer-based performance modeling framework designed to achieve robust in-distribution generalization across trained topologies under novel parameter configurations and zero-shot generalization to unseen topologies without any fine-tuning. We apply three key enabling strategies: (1) a diverse training corpus of 3.6 million instances covering over 60 amplifier topologies, (2) unified topology embeddings leveraging global-aware tokens and hierarchical attention to robustly generalize to novel circuits, and (3) a topology-conditioned parameter mapping approach that maintains consistent structural representations independent of parameter variations. Our experimental results demonstrate that ZeroSim significantly outperforms baseline models such as multilayer perceptrons, graph neural networks and transformers, delivering accurate zero-shot predictions across different amplifier topologies. Additionally, when integrated into a reinforcement learning-based parameter optimization pipeline, ZeroSim achieves a remarkable speedup (13x) compared to conventional SPICE simulations, underscoring its practical value for a wide range of analog circuit design automation tasks.

Result: 在三个自由形式问答数据集和多个LLM上的实验结果表明，该方法优于昂贵的先进基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有助于提高LLM的可信度，为增强LLM信任度做出了贡献。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong performance across various natural language processing (NLP) tasks but remain vulnerable to hallucinations, generating factually incorrect or misleading outputs. Uncertainty estimation, often using predictive entropy estimation, is key to addressing this issue. However, existing methods often require multiple samples or extra computation to assess semantic entropy. This paper proposes an efficient, training-free uncertainty estimation method that approximates predictive entropy using the responses' top-$K$ probabilities. Moreover, we employ an adaptive mechanism to determine $K$ to enhance flexibility and filter out low-confidence probabilities. Experimental results on three free-form question-answering datasets across several LLMs demonstrate that our method outperforms expensive state-of-the-art baselines, contributing to the broader goal of enhancing LLM trustworthiness.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) models have demonstrated expert-level performance in melanoma detection, yet their clinical adoption is hindered by performance disparities across demographic subgroups such as gender, race, and age. Previous efforts to benchmark the performance of AI models have primarily focused on assessing model performance using group fairness metrics that rely on the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC), which does not provide insights into a model's ability to provide accurate estimates. In line with clinical assessments, this paper addresses this gap by incorporating calibration as a complementary benchmarking metric to AUROC-based fairness metrics. Calibration evaluates the alignment between predicted probabilities and observed event rates, offering deeper insights into subgroup biases. We assess the performance of the leading skin cancer detection algorithm of the ISIC 2020 Challenge on the ISIC 2020 Challenge dataset and the PROVE-AI dataset, and compare it with the second and third place models, focusing on subgroups defined by sex, race (Fitzpatrick Skin Tone), and age. Our findings reveal that while existing models enhance discriminative accuracy, they often over-diagnose risk and exhibit calibration issues when applied to new datasets. This study underscores the necessity for comprehensive model auditing strategies and extensive metadata collection to achieve equitable AI-driven healthcare solutions.

TL;DR: SHIFT是一种基于扩散模型的策略无关状态扰动攻击，能够生成语义不同的扰动状态，有效破解现有RL防御机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RL防御机制的有效性主要源于传统l_p范数约束攻击的局限性，这些攻击即使在大扰动预算下也难以改变图像输入的语义。

Method: 提出SHIFT攻击方法，利用扩散模型生成语义不同但保持真实性和历史一致性的扰动状态，避免被检测。

Result: 评估显示SHIFT攻击能有效破解包括最先进防御在内的现有防御机制，显著优于现有攻击方法，且具有更好的感知隐蔽性。

Conclusion: RL智能体对语义感知对抗扰动存在严重脆弱性，需要开发更鲁棒的政策。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) systems, while achieving remarkable success across various domains, are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. This is especially a concern in vision-based environments where minor manipulations of high-dimensional image inputs can easily mislead the agent's behavior. To this end, various defenses have been proposed recently, with state-of-the-art approaches achieving robust performance even under large state perturbations. However, after closer investigation, we found that the effectiveness of the current defenses is due to a fundamental weakness of the existing $l_p$ norm-constrained attacks, which can barely alter the semantics of image input even under a relatively large perturbation budget. In this work, we propose SHIFT, a novel policy-agnostic diffusion-based state perturbation attack to go beyond this limitation. Our attack is able to generate perturbed states that are semantically different from the true states while remaining realistic and history-aligned to avoid detection. Evaluations show that our attack effectively breaks existing defenses, including the most sophisticated ones, significantly outperforming existing attacks while being more perceptually stealthy. The results highlight the vulnerability of RL agents to semantics-aware adversarial perturbations, indicating the importance of developing more robust policies.

Motivation: 传统仿真优化方法存在严重局限性：一次只能优化单个问题，且需要大量计算时间进行网格划分和数值模拟。需要克服这些固有缺陷。

Method: 采用深度强化学习架构作为优化器，与参数化物理信息神经网络构成的环境交互，探索关键参数间的关系。优化器以Schmidt数为条件，寻找最大化微混合器效率的最优几何和物理参数。

Result: 在广泛的Schmidt数范围内训练后，所有最优设计的效率都超过了基线值。在Schmidt数为13.3时达到最大效率，提升约32%。与遗传算法的对比分析显示了该方法的优势。

Conclusion: 所提出的科学机器学习框架能够有效克服传统优化方法的局限性，提供快速、高效的多维优化解决方案，在工程应用中具有显著优势。

Abstract: Multidimensional optimization has consistently been a critical challenge in engineering. However, traditional simulation-based optimization methods have long been plagued by significant limitations: they are typically capable of optimizing only a single problem at a time and require substantial computational time for meshing and numerical simulation. This paper introduces a novel framework leveraging cutting-edge Scientific Machine Learning (Sci-ML) methodologies to overcome these inherent drawbacks of conventional approaches. The proposed method provides instantaneous solutions to a spectrum of complex, multidimensional optimization problems. A micromixer case study is employed to demonstrate this methodology. An agent, operating on a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) architecture, serves as the optimizer to explore the relationships between key problem parameters. This optimizer interacts with an environment constituted by a parametric Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN), which responds to the agent's actions at a significantly higher speed than traditional numerical methods. The agent's objective, conditioned on the Schmidt number is to discover the optimal geometric and physical parameters that maximize the micromixer's efficiency. After training the agent across a wide range of Schmidt numbers, we analyzed the resulting optimal designs. Across this entire spectrum, the achieved efficiency was consistently greater than the baseline, normalized value. The maximum efficiency occurred at a Schmidt number of 13.3, demonstrating an improvement of approximately 32%. Finally, a comparative analysis with a Genetic Algorithm was conducted under equivalent conditions to underscore the advantages of the proposed method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自由流动汽车共享服务中的车辆重定位问题，通过优化车辆和人员的调度策略来提高服务效率，满足不同区域的时间模式需求。

Method: 首先将服务区域划分为具有相似时间模式的区域，然后提出基于快速排序的算法，考虑每个区域的可用车辆数量、需求概率密度和行程持续时间进行决策优化。

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验表明，与无优化基线相比，该算法平均改进8.44%，MIP求解器改进19.6%，但MIP模型包含了当前业务规则排除的行程选择决策。

Conclusion: 提出的解决方案能够根据人员规模将性能指标提高约3%-10%，为汽车共享服务的车辆重定位问题提供了有效的优化方法。

Abstract: The paper addresses the Vehicle Relocation Problem in free-floating car-sharing services by presenting a solution focused on strategies for repositioning vehicles and transferring personnel with the use of scooters. Our method begins by dividing the service area into zones that group regions with similar temporal patterns of vehicle presence and service demand, allowing the application of discrete optimization methods. In the next stage, we propose a fast ranking-based algorithm that makes its decisions on the basis of the number of cars available in each zone, the projected probability density of demand, and estimated trip durations. The experiments were carried out on the basis of real-world data originating from a major car-sharing service operator in Poland. The results of this algorithm are evaluated against scenarios without optimization that constitute a baseline and compared with the results of an exact algorithm to solve the Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model. As performance metrics, the total travel time was used. Under identical conditions (number of vehicles, staff, and demand distribution), the average improvements with respect to the baseline of our algorithm and MIP solver were equal to 8.44\% and 19.6\% correspondingly. However, it should be noted that the MIP model also mimicked decisions on trip selection, which are excluded by current services business rules. The analysis of results suggests that, depending on the size of the workforce, the application of the proposed solution allows for improving performance metrics by roughly 3%-10%.

Motivation: 解决AI中长视野目标达成问题，特别是如何准确估计观测对之间的时序距离。传统时序差分方法虽然具有最优性保证但性能不如蒙特卡洛方法，而蒙特卡洛方法缺乏理论保证。

Method: 将时序差分和蒙特卡洛方法结合，提出实用的GCRL方法，使用多步蒙特卡洛回报拟合拟度量距离。

Conclusion: 提出的方法成功整合了时序差分和蒙特卡洛方法的优势，在长视野任务中表现出色，并在真实机器人操作领域实现了突破。

Abstract: Learning how to reach goals in an environment is a longstanding challenge in AI, yet reasoning over long horizons remains a challenge for modern methods. The key question is how to estimate the temporal distance between pairs of observations. While temporal difference methods leverage local updates to provide optimality guarantees, they often perform worse than Monte Carlo methods that perform global updates (e.g., with multi-step returns), which lack such guarantees. We show how these approaches can be integrated into a practical GCRL method that fits a quasimetric distance using a multistep Monte-Carlo return. We show our method outperforms existing GCRL methods on long-horizon simulated tasks with up to 4000 steps, even with visual observations. We also demonstrate that our method can enable stitching in the real-world robotic manipulation domain (Bridge setup). Our approach is the first end-to-end GCRL method that enables multistep stitching in this real-world manipulation domain from an unlabeled offline dataset of visual observations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 贝叶斯优化在优化昂贵黑盒目标方面很强大，但扩展到图结构领域仍然具有挑战性，因为图具有离散和组合性质。现有方法要么依赖完整的图拓扑（对于大型或部分观测图不实用），要么依赖增量探索（可能导致收敛缓慢）。

Conclusion: 该框架为图结构域的可扩展全局优化提供了一种有效方法，通过理论分析建立了在不同采样机制下准确恢复底层图结构的条件。

Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a powerful framework for optimizing expensive black-box objectives, yet extending it to graph-structured domains remains challenging due to the discrete and combinatorial nature of graphs. Existing approaches often rely on either full graph topology-impractical for large or partially observed graphs-or incremental exploration, which can lead to slow convergence. We introduce a scalable framework for global optimization over graphs that employs low-rank spectral representations to build Gaussian process (GP) surrogates from sparse structural observations. The method jointly infers graph structure and node representations through learnable embeddings, enabling efficient global search and principled uncertainty estimation even with limited data. We also provide theoretical analysis establishing conditions for accurate recovery of underlying graph structure under different sampling regimes. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves faster convergence and improved optimization performance compared to prior methods.

Motivation: 现有无监督RLVR方法容易过拟合到错误标签，限制了GRPO中关键的奖励排序信号，需要增强噪声容忍能力。

Method: 双阶段token级熵优化：探索阶段最大化token级熵促进多样化输出，防止过早收敛到噪声标签；利用阶段最小化token级熵鼓励确定性输出，巩固学习成果。

Conclusion: 该分阶段策略通过统一和增强外部、内部和基于熵的方法，在所有测试场景中实现了鲁棒且优越的性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is highly dependent on high-quality labeled data, which is often scarce and prone to substantial annotation noise in real-world scenarios. Existing unsupervised RLVR methods, including pure entropy minimization, can overfit to incorrect labels and limit the crucial reward ranking signal for Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). To address these challenges and enhance noise tolerance, we propose a novel two-stage, token-level entropy optimization method for RLVR. This approach dynamically guides the model from exploration to exploitation during training. In the initial exploration phase, token-level entropy maximization promotes diverse and stochastic output generation, serving as a strong regularizer that prevents premature convergence to noisy labels and ensures sufficient intra-group variation, which enables more reliable reward gradient estimation in GRPO. As training progresses, the method transitions into the exploitation phase, where token-level entropy minimization encourages the model to produce confident and deterministic outputs, thereby consolidating acquired knowledge and refining prediction accuracy. Empirically, across three MLLM backbones - Qwen2-VL-2B, Qwen2-VL-7B, and Qwen2.5-VL-3B - spanning diverse noise settings and multiple tasks, our phased strategy consistently outperforms prior approaches by unifying and enhancing external, internal, and entropy-based methods, delivering robust and superior performance across the board.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的无调度方法理论只支持恒定学习率，但实际实现使用预热调度。需要扩展理论以支持任意调度器，并理解学习率变化对收敛的影响。

Method: 扩展无调度方法的最后迭代收敛理论，允许使用任意学习率调度器，并推导学习率与平均参数的关系。基于凸性假设设计了新的自适应Polyak学习率调度。

Result: 理论分析显示在wsd调度下达到最优收敛率O(1/√T)。新Polyak调度在模型蒸馏任务中表现优于多个基线方法。

Conclusion: 扩展后的无调度理论具有实际预测能力，新提出的自适应Polyak调度实现了最优的任意时间最后迭代收敛性能。

Abstract: The recently proposed schedule-free method has been shown to achieve strong performance when hyperparameter tuning is limited. The current theory for schedule-free only supports a constant learning rate, where-as the implementation used in practice uses a warm-up schedule. We show how to extend the last-iterate convergence theory of schedule-free to allow for any scheduler, and how the averaging parameter has to be updated as a function of the learning rate. We then perform experiments showing how our convergence theory has some predictive power with regards to practical executions on deep neural networks, despite that this theory relies on assuming convexity. When applied to the warmup-stable-decay (wsd) schedule, our theory shows the optimal convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$. We then use convexity to design a new adaptive Polyak learning rate schedule for schedule-free. We prove an optimal anytime last-iterate convergence for our new Polyak schedule, and show that it performs well compared to a number of baselines on a black-box model distillation task.

Motivation: 大型天气预报模型如Aurora虽然精度高但缺乏透明度，这种'黑盒'特性阻碍了其在高风险操作环境中的应用，需要验证其内部表示是否符合已知物理和气象概念。

Method: 使用大规模嵌入数据集，训练线性分类器来识别三个不同概念：基本陆地-海洋边界、高影响极端温度事件和大气不稳定性。

Result: 研究提供了定量证据表明Aurora学习了物理一致的特征，但也突显了其在捕捉最罕见事件方面的局限性。

Conclusion: 这项工作强调了可解释性方法对于验证和建立对下一代AI驱动天气模型信任的关键需求。

Abstract: The high accuracy of large-scale weather forecasting models like Aurora is often accompanied by a lack of transparency, as their internal representations remain largely opaque. This "black box" nature hinders their adoption in high-stakes operational settings. In this work, we probe the physical consistency of Aurora's encoder by investigating whether its latent representations align with known physical and meteorological concepts. Using a large-scale dataset of embeddings, we train linear classifiers to identify three distinct concepts: the fundamental land-sea boundary, high-impact extreme temperature events, and atmospheric instability. Our findings provide quantitative evidence that Aurora learns physically consistent features, while also highlighting its limitations in capturing the rarest events. This work underscores the critical need for interpretability methods to validate and build trust in the next generation of Al-driven weather models.

Abstract: This paper proposes a topic modeling method that scales linearly to billions of documents. We make three core contributions: i) we present a topic modeling method, Tensor Latent Dirichlet Allocation (TLDA), that has identifiable and recoverable parameter guarantees and sample complexity guarantees for large data; ii) we show that this method is computationally and memory efficient (achieving speeds over 3-4x those of prior parallelized Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) methods), and that it scales linearly to text datasets with over a billion documents; iii) we provide an open-source, GPU-based implementation, of this method. This scaling enables previously prohibitive analyses, and we perform two real-world, large-scale new studies of interest to political scientists: we provide the first thorough analysis of the evolution of the #MeToo movement through the lens of over two years of Twitter conversation and a detailed study of social media conversations about election fraud in the 2020 presidential election. Thus this method provides social scientists with the ability to study very large corpora at scale and to answer important theoretically-relevant questions about salient issues in near real-time.

Motivation: 随着机器学习应用日益复杂，现代ML框架需要处理不同层间决策变量耦合的多个潜在冲突目标，这产生了对多目标双层学习（MOBL）的迫切需求。目前该领域仍处于起步阶段，许多重要问题尚未充分探索。

Conclusion: WC-MHGD框架为多目标双层学习问题提供了有效的理论和算法基础，通过广泛的实验验证了理论结果。

Abstract: As machine learning (ML) applications grow increasingly complex in recent years, modern ML frameworks often need to address multiple potentially conflicting objectives with coupled decision variables across different layers. This creates a compelling need for multi-objective bilevel learning (MOBL). So far, however, the field of MOBL remains in its infancy and many important problems remain under-explored. This motivates us to fill this gap and systematically investigate the theoretical and algorithmic foundation of MOBL. Specifically, we consider MOBL problems with multiple conflicting objectives guided by preferences at the upper-level subproblem, where part of the inputs depend on the optimal solution of the lower-level subproblem. Our goal is to develop efficient MOBL optimization algorithms to (1) identify a preference-guided Pareto-stationary solution with low oracle complexity; and (2) enable systematic Pareto front exploration. To this end, we propose a unifying algorithmic framework called weighted-Chebyshev multi-hyper-gradient-descent (WC-MHGD) for both deterministic and stochastic settings with finite-time Pareto-stationarity convergence rate guarantees, which not only implies low oracle complexity but also induces systematic Pareto front exploration. We further conduct extensive experiments to confirm our theoretical results.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a powerful framework for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, existing approaches such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and its variants, while effective on reasoning benchmarks, struggle with agentic tasks that require iterative decision-making. We introduce Murphy, a multi-turn reflective optimization framework that extends GRPO by incorporating iterative self-correction during training. By leveraging both quantitative and qualitative execution feedback, Murphy enables models to progressively refine their reasoning across multiple turns. Evaluations on code generation benchmarks with model families such as Qwen and OLMo show that Murphy consistently improves performance, achieving up to a 8% relative gain in pass@1 over GRPO, on similar compute budgets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着深度学习广泛使用敏感数据，差分隐私(DP)提供了保护训练过程中信息泄露的正式保证。挑战在于实现既能保持强性能又能保护隐私的DP优化器。AdamW因其强大的经验性能而成为流行的深度学习训练优化器。

Method: 研究DP-AdamW并引入DP-AdamW-BC，这是AdamW优化器的差分隐私变体，对第二矩估计器进行DP偏置校正。首先展示了DP-AdamW和DP-AdamW-BC的隐私和收敛保证的理论结果，然后在多个隐私预算(ε=1,3,7)下对两种优化器进行实证分析。

Result: DP-AdamW在文本分类上比现有DP优化器(DP-SGD、DP-Adam、DP-AdamBC)高出15%以上，在图像分类上高出5%，在图节点分类上始终高出1%。而DP-AdamW-BC的偏置校正反而会持续降低准确率，这与DP-AdamBC对DP-Adam的改进形成对比。

Conclusion: DP-AdamW是当前最先进的差分隐私优化器，在多个任务上显著优于现有方法。然而，在DP-AdamW中添加偏置校正会损害性能，这与传统Adam优化器的经验相反。

Abstract: As deep learning methods increasingly utilize sensitive data on a widespread scale, differential privacy (DP) offers formal guarantees to protect against information leakage during model training. A significant challenge remains in implementing DP optimizers that retain strong performance while preserving privacy. Recent advances introduced ever more efficient optimizers, with AdamW being a popular choice for training deep learning models because of strong empirical performance. We study \emph{DP-AdamW} and introduce \emph{DP-AdamW-BC}, a differentially private variant of the AdamW optimizer with DP bias correction for the second moment estimator. We start by showing theoretical results for privacy and convergence guarantees of DP-AdamW and DP-AdamW-BC. Then, we empirically analyze the behavior of both optimizers across multiple privacy budgets ($ε= 1, 3, 7$). We find that DP-AdamW outperforms existing state-of-the-art differentially private optimizers like DP-SGD, DP-Adam, and DP-AdamBC, scoring over 15\% higher on text classification, up to 5\% higher on image classification, and consistently 1\% higher on graph node classification. Moreover, we empirically show that incorporating bias correction in DP-AdamW (DP-AdamW-BC) consistently decreases accuracy, in contrast to the improvement of DP-AdamBC improvement over DP-Adam.

Conclusion: 该框架不仅统一了不同架构的分析，还提供了对网络表达能力渐进演化的逐步理解，为深度学习理论提供了共同的分析基础。

Abstract: Deep learning architectures are highly diverse. To prove their universal approximation properties, existing works typically rely on model-specific proofs. Generally, they construct a dedicated mathematical formulation for each architecture (e.g., fully connected networks, CNNs, or Transformers) and then prove their universal approximability. However, this approach suffers from two major limitations: first, every newly proposed architecture often requires a completely new proof from scratch; second, these proofs are largely isolated from one another, lacking a common analytical foundation. This not only incurs significant redundancy but also hinders unified theoretical understanding across different network families. To address these issues, this paper proposes a general and modular framework for proving universal approximation. We define a basic building block (comprising one or multiple layers) that possesses the universal approximation property as a Universal Approximation Module (UAM). Under this condition, we show that any deep network composed of such modules inherently retains the universal approximation property. Moreover, the overall approximation process can be interpreted as a progressive refinement across modules. This perspective not only unifies the analysis of diverse architectures but also enables a step-by-step understanding of how expressive power evolves through the network.

Result: 发现PE与REINFORCE边际价值负相关(r≈-0.38)，稳定化后变为正相关(r≈+0.29)；方差调节机制被证实：固定能量下高PE降低梯度方差，鞍点附近高方差增加逃逸概率。

Conclusion: 轨迹价值是算法相关的；留一交叉验证分数适合剪枝，而Shapley能识别有害子集，两种方法互补。

Abstract: We study how trajectory value depends on the learning algorithm in policy-gradient control. Using Trajectory Shapley in an uncertain LQR, we find a negative correlation between Persistence of Excitation (PE) and marginal value under vanilla REINFORCE ($r\approx-0.38$). We prove a variance-mediated mechanism: (i) for fixed energy, higher PE yields lower gradient variance; (ii) near saddles, higher variance increases escape probability, raising marginal contribution. When stabilized (state whitening or Fisher preconditioning), this variance channel is neutralized and information content dominates, flipping the correlation positive ($r\approx+0.29$). Hence, trajectory value is algorithm-relative. Experiments validate the mechanism and show decision-aligned scores (Leave-One-Out) complement Shapley for pruning, while Shapley identifies toxic subsets.

Abstract: Brain-computer interface (BCI) aims to decode motor intent from noninvasive neural signals to enable control of external devices, but practical deployment remains limited by noise and variability in motor imagery (MI)-based electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. This work investigates a hierarchical and meta-cognitive decoding framework for four-class MI classification. We introduce a multi-scale hierarchical signal processing module that reorganizes backbone features into temporal multi-scale representations, together with an introspective uncertainty estimation module that assigns per-cycle reliability scores and guides iterative refinement. We instantiate this framework on three standard EEG backbones (EEGNet, ShallowConvNet, and DeepConvNet) and evaluate four-class MI decoding using the BCI Competition IV-2a dataset under a subject-independent setting. Across all backbones, the proposed components improve average classification accuracy and reduce inter-subject variance compared to the corresponding baselines, indicating increased robustness to subject heterogeneity and noisy trials. These results suggest that combining hierarchical multi-scale processing with introspective confidence estimation can enhance the reliability of MI-based BCI systems.

Motivation: 现有的经验缩放定律在特定体系内一致，但在模型压缩等相关设置中报告了明显不同的缩放行为。受神经网络表示谱分析进展的启发，需要开发统一框架来理解这些现象。

Method: 开发广义谱框架，将谱演化函数从$g(λt)=λt$推广到渐近多项式函数$g(λ,t;β)$，并引入有效谱-时间弹性$ρ(β)$参数。

Result: 该框架恢复了现有的惰性学习和特征学习理论作为特例，并得出了学习与压缩之间的不变关系。

Conclusion: 广义谱框架为理解神经网络的学习动态和压缩现象提供了统一的理论基础，揭示了不同缩放行为背后的共同机制。

Abstract: Empirical scaling laws describe how test loss and other performance metrics depend on model size, dataset size, and compute. While such laws are consistent within specific regimes, apparently distinct scaling behaviors have been reported for related settings such as model compression. Motivated by recent progress in spectral analyses of neural representations, this paper develops a \emph{generalized spectral framework} that unifies learning dynamics and compression phenomena under a common functional ansatz. We generalize the spectral evolution function from the linear kernel form $g(λt)=λt$ to an asymptotically polynomial function $g(λ,t;β)$, characterized by an effective spectral--temporal elasticity $ρ(β)$. This framework recovers existing lazy and feature-learning theories as special cases and yields an invariant relation between learning and compression

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hamilton-Jacobi可达性分析在验证学习型自主系统安全性时计算成本高昂，特别是高维系统。虽然强化学习方法可以近似值函数，但学习到的值函数和相应安全策略无法保证正确性，需要解决这种不确定性。

Method: 使用共形预测框架来量化学习型HJ值函数的不确定性，通过CP校准不安全标称控制器与学习的安全策略之间的切换，并研究使用独立训练的HJ值函数集成作为安全过滤器。

Result: 该框架能够为使用学习型HJ值函数和策略的控制系统提供概率安全保证，防止系统到达故障状态，并通过集成方法提高了安全性能。

Conclusion: 基于共形预测的框架有效解决了学习型HJ可达性分析中的不确定性挑战，为学习型自主系统的安全部署提供了可验证的概率保证。

Abstract: Safety assurance is a fundamental requirement for deploying learning-enabled autonomous systems. Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis is a fundamental method for formally verifying safety and generating safe controllers. However, computing the HJ value function that characterizes the backward reachable set (BRS) of a set of user-defined failure states is computationally expensive, especially for high-dimensional systems, motivating the use of reinforcement learning approaches to approximate the value function. Unfortunately, a learned value function and its corresponding safe policy are not guaranteed to be correct. The learned value function evaluated at a given state may not be equal to the actual safety return achieved by following the learned safe policy. To address this challenge, we introduce a conformal prediction-based (CP) framework that bounds such uncertainty. We leverage CP to provide probabilistic safety guarantees when using learned HJ value functions and policies to prevent control systems from reaching failure states. Specifically, we use CP to calibrate the switching between the unsafe nominal controller and the learned HJ-based safe policy and to derive safety guarantees under this switched policy. We also investigate using an ensemble of independently trained HJ value functions as a safety filter and compare this ensemble approach to using individual value functions alone.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习中的奖励函数既要定义最优目标又要指导学习过程，手动设计困难且往往导致次优任务表示。受满意理论启发，希望通过测试函数分离这两个功能来简化任务定义。

Method: 使用通过-失败测试和指示性测试分别定义最优目标和指导学习过程；基于轨迹返回函数证明最大熵策略优化能产生接近最优策略集的策略；引入词典序启发式方法比较轨迹与最优轨迹集的相对距离关系。

Result: 在DeepMind Control Suite基准测试中，TdRL在策略训练上匹配或优于手工设计的奖励方法，具有更大的设计简单性和对多目标优化的内在支持。

Conclusion: TdRL为表示任务目标提供了新的视角，有助于解决强化学习应用中的奖励设计挑战。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has been recognized as a powerful tool for robot control tasks. RL typically employs reward functions to define task objectives and guide agent learning. However, since the reward function serves the dual purpose of defining the optimal goal and guiding learning, it is challenging to design the reward function manually, which often results in a suboptimal task representation. To tackle the reward design challenge in RL, inspired by the satisficing theory, we propose a Test-driven Reinforcement Learning (TdRL) framework. In the TdRL framework, multiple test functions are used to represent the task objective rather than a single reward function. Test functions can be categorized as pass-fail tests and indicative tests, each dedicated to defining the optimal objective and guiding the learning process, respectively, thereby making defining tasks easier. Building upon such a task definition, we first prove that if a trajectory return function assigns higher returns to trajectories closer to the optimal trajectory set, maximum entropy policy optimization based on this return function will yield a policy that is closer to the optimal policy set. Then, we introduce a lexicographic heuristic approach to compare the relative distance relationship between trajectories and the optimal trajectory set for learning the trajectory return function. Furthermore, we develop an algorithm implementation of TdRL. Experimental results on the DeepMind Control Suite benchmark demonstrate that TdRL matches or outperforms handcrafted reward methods in policy training, with greater design simplicity and inherent support for multi-objective optimization. We argue that TdRL offers a novel perspective for representing task objectives, which could be helpful in addressing the reward design challenges in RL applications.

Conclusion: CellARC为小模型快速迭代提供了可控基准，展示了神经符号方法的互补性，并为在严格计算预算下研究模型推理能力提供了可重复框架。

Abstract: We introduce CellARC, a synthetic benchmark for abstraction and reasoning built from multicolor 1D cellular automata (CA). Each episode has five support pairs and one query serialized in 256 tokens, enabling rapid iteration with small models while exposing a controllable task space with explicit knobs for alphabet size k, radius r, rule family, Langton's lambda, query coverage, and cell entropy. We release 95k training episodes plus two 1k test splits (interpolation/extrapolation) and evaluate symbolic, recurrent, convolutional, transformer, recursive, and LLM baselines. CellARC decouples generalization from anthropomorphic priors, supports unlimited difficulty-controlled sampling, and enables reproducible studies of how quickly models infer new rules under tight budgets. Our strongest small-model baseline (a 10M-parameter vanilla transformer) outperforms recent recursive models (TRM, HRM), reaching 58.0%/32.4% per-token accuracy on the interpolation/extrapolation splits, while a large closed model (GPT-5 High) attains 62.3%/48.1% on subsets of 100 test tasks. An ensemble that chooses per episode between the Transformer and the best symbolic baseline reaches 65.4%/35.5%, highlighting neuro-symbolic complementarity.

Result: 在多种模型架构和数据集上的实验验证：RF模型使用Rectified Noise后，在ImageNet-1k上FID从10.16降至9.05；π-noise生成器仅需0.39%额外训练参数即可获得性能提升。

Conclusion: Rectified Noise是一种有效的生成算法，能够通过少量额外参数显著提升预训练RF模型的生成性能，证明了π-noise注入策略的有效性。

Abstract: Rectified Flow (RF) has been widely used as an effective generative model. Although RF is primarily based on probability flow Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE), recent studies have shown that injecting noise through reverse-time Stochastic Differential Equations (SDE) for sampling can achieve superior generative performance. Inspired by Positive-incentive Noise ($π$-noise), we propose an innovative generative algorithm to train $π$-noise generators, namely Rectified Noise ($Δ$RN), which improves the generative performance by injecting $π$-noise into the velocity field of pre-trained RF models. After introducing the Rectified Noise pipeline, pre-trained RF models can be efficiently transformed into $π$-noise generators. We validate Rectified Noise by conducting extensive experiments across various model architectures on different datasets. Notably, we find that: (1) RF models using Rectified Noise reduce FID from \textbf{10.16 to 9.05} on ImageNet-1k. (2) The models of $π$-noise generators achieve improved performance with only \textbf{0.39\%} additional training parameters.

TL;DR: Feedback Descent是一个通过结构化文本反馈来优化文本工件（提示、代码、分子）的框架，它利用详细批评而非标量奖励，在推理时进行纯文本空间优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将判断压缩为二进制偏好，造成信息瓶颈。Feedback Descent通过保留结构化反馈来拓宽信息瓶颈，实现更有效的文本空间优化。

Method: 使用上下文学习将结构化反馈转化为类似梯度的方向信息，实现有针对性的编辑。评估器为每个比较提供文本反馈，作为高带宽监督。优化循环在推理时完成，不修改模型权重。

Result: 在三个不同领域评估中，Feedback Descent优于最先进的提示优化（GEPA）、强化学习方法（GRPO、REINVENT）和专门的基于图的分子优化器。在DOCKSTRING分子发现基准测试中，发现了超过260,000个化合物数据库中99.9%百分位的新型类药物分子。

Conclusion: Feedback Descent通过结构化文本反馈实现了有效的文本空间优化，在多个领域超越了现有方法，特别是在分子发现方面表现出色。

Abstract: We introduce \textit{Feedback Descent}, a framework that optimizes text artifacts -- prompts, code, and molecules -- through structured textual feedback, rather than relying solely on scalar rewards. By preserving detailed critiques instead of compressing them to binary preferences, Feedback Descent widens the information bottleneck in preference learning, enabling directed optimization in text space rather than weight space. We show that in-context learning can transform structured feedback into gradient-like directional information, enabling targeted edits. Unlike prior approaches that collapse judgments into single bits, our evaluators pair each comparison with textual feedback, which functions as high-bandwidth supervision. The iteration loop is done purely at inference time, without modifying any model weights, and is task-agnostic. We evaluate Feedback Descent on three diverse domains and find that it outperforms state-of-the-art prompt optimization (GEPA), reinforcement learning methods (GRPO, REINVENT), and even specialized graph-based molecular optimizers. In the DOCKSTRING molecule discovery benchmark, Feedback Descent identifies novel drug-like molecules surpassing the $99.9$th percentile of a database with more than $260{,}000$ compounds across six protein targets.

TL;DR: 提出SERL框架，让LLM同时扮演Actor和Judge角色，通过两种内部奖励机制实现自我改进，无需外部信号，在开放域任务上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RL在开放域任务中的两个关键挑战：主观性任务无法提供可验证奖励，以及RLHF依赖外部奖励机制。

Method: SERL框架包含两个协同的奖励机制：基于Copeland风格成对比较的Actor奖励，和鼓励一致判断的Judge自一致性奖励。

Result: 在AlpacaEval 2上，Qwen3-8B的LC胜率从52.37%提升到59.90%，达到自我改进方法中的最先进水平，性能接近Qwen3-32B等更大模型。

Conclusion: SERL框架有效克服了开放域任务中RL应用的局限性，实现了无需外部信号的自我改进，在多个开放域任务上表现出优越的有效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been shown to improve the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, applying RL to open-domain tasks faces two key challenges: (1) the inherent subjectivity of these tasks prevents the verifiable rewards as required by Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR); (2) Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) relies on external reward mechanisms. To overcome these limitations, we propose Self-Examining Reinforcement Learning (SERL), a novel self-improving framework where the LLM serves as both Actor and Judge. SERL introduces two synergistic reward mechanisms without any external signals. On the one hand, to improve the Actor's capability, we derive rewards from Copeland-style pairwise comparison judgments across a group of generated responses. On the other hand, a self-consistency reward that encourages coherent judgments is proposed to improve the Judge's reliability. This process refines the Judge's capability, which in turn provides a more robust reward for Actor. Experiments show that our method outperforms existing self-improvement training methods. SERL improves the LC win rate of Qwen3-8B on AlpacaEval 2 from 52.37% to 59.90%. To the best of our knowledge, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance among self-improving approaches. Furthermore, it achieves a performance comparable to significantly larger models like Qwen3-32B, demonstrating superior effectiveness and robustness on open-domain tasks.

Conclusion: IBMA是一种有效的时间序列数据增强方法，能够显著提升各种预测模型的性能

Abstract: Data augmentation in time series forecasting plays a crucial role in enhancing model performance by introducing variability while maintaining the underlying temporal patterns. However, time series data offers fewer augmentation strategies compared to fields such as image or text, with advanced techniques like Mixup rarely being used. In this work, we propose a novel approach, Imputation-Based Mixup Augmentation (IBMA), which combines Imputation-Augmented data with Mixup augmentation to bolster model generalization and improve forecasting performance. We evaluate the effectiveness of this method across several forecasting models, including DLinear (MLP), TimesNet (CNN), and iTrainformer (Transformer), these models represent some of the most recent advances in time series forecasting. Our experiments, conducted on four datasets (ETTh1, ETTh2, ETTm1, ETTm2) and compared against eight other augmentation techniques, demonstrate that IBMA consistently enhances performance, achieving 22 improvements out of 24 instances, with 10 of those being the best performances, particularly with iTrainformer imputation.

Abstract: Power-logistics scheduling in modern seaports typically follow a predict-then-optimize pipeline. To enhance decision quality, decision-focused learning has been proposed to align forecasting and optimization via end-to-end training. However, most formulations assume a fixed task configuration in downstream optimization, and thus generalize poorly to evolving task structures induced by varying seaport vessel arrivals. We address this gap with a decision-focused continual learning framework that adapts online to a stream of scheduling tasks. Specifically, we introduce Fisher information based regularization to enhance cross-task generalization by preserving parameters critical to prior tasks. A differentiable convex surrogate is also developed to stabilize gradient backpropagation. The proposed approach enables learning a decision-aligned forecasting model for new scheduling tasks while retaining generalization on earlier tasks. Experiments calibrated to the Jurong Port demonstrate superior decision performance and generalization over existing methods with reduced computational cost.

Conclusion: 该框架能够仅从名义动态下的专家演示中学习鲁棒策略，有效应对环境动态变化带来的挑战。

Abstract: Imitation Learning (IL) has proven highly effective for robotic and control tasks where manually designing reward functions or explicit controllers is infeasible. However, standard IL methods implicitly assume that the environment dynamics remain fixed between training and deployment. In practice, this assumption rarely holds where modeling inaccuracies, real-world parameter variations, and adversarial perturbations can all induce shifts in transition dynamics, leading to severe performance degradation. We address this challenge through Balance Equation-based Distributionally Robust Offline Imitation Learning, a framework that learns robust policies solely from expert demonstrations collected under nominal dynamics, without requiring further environment interaction. We formulate the problem as a distributionally robust optimization over an uncertainty set of transition models, seeking a policy that minimizes the imitation loss under the worst-case transition distribution. Importantly, we show that this robust objective can be reformulated entirely in terms of the nominal data distribution, enabling tractable offline learning. Empirical evaluations on continuous-control benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves superior robustness and generalization compared to state-of-the-art offline IL baselines, particularly under perturbed or shifted environments.

Abstract: Machine unlearning--the ability to remove designated concepts from a pre-trained model--has advanced rapidly, particularly for text-to-image diffusion models. However, existing methods typically assume that unlearning requests arrive all at once, whereas in practice they often arrive sequentially. We present the first systematic study of continual unlearning in text-to-image diffusion models and show that popular unlearning methods suffer from rapid utility collapse: after only a few requests, models forget retained knowledge and generate degraded images. We trace this failure to cumulative parameter drift from the pre-training weights and argue that regularization is crucial to addressing it. To this end, we study a suite of add-on regularizers that (1) mitigate drift and (2) remain compatible with existing unlearning methods. Beyond generic regularizers, we show that semantic awareness is essential for preserving concepts close to the unlearning target, and propose a gradient-projection method that constrains parameter drift orthogonal to their subspace. This substantially improves continual unlearning performance and is complementary to other regularizers for further gains. Taken together, our study establishes continual unlearning as a fundamental challenge in text-to-image generation and provides insights, baselines, and open directions for advancing safe and accountable generative AI.

Abstract: We introduce LOREN, a curvature-aware zeroth-order (ZO) optimization method for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). Existing ZO methods, which estimate gradients via finite differences using random perturbations, often suffer from high variance and suboptimal search directions. Our approach addresses these challenges by: (i) reformulating the problem of gradient preconditioning as that of adaptively estimating an anisotropic perturbation distribution for gradient estimation, (ii) capturing curvature through a low-rank block diagonal preconditioner using the framework of natural evolution strategies, and (iii) applying a REINFORCE leave-one-out (RLOO) gradient estimator to reduce variance. Experiments on standard LLM benchmarks show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art ZO methods by achieving higher accuracy and faster convergence, while cutting peak memory usage by up to 27.3% compared with MeZO-Adam.

Abstract: Graph Transformers (GTs) have shown strong empirical performance, yet current architectures vary widely in their use of attention mechanisms, positional embeddings (PEs), and expressivity. Existing expressivity results are often tied to specific design choices and lack comprehensive empirical validation on large-scale data. This leaves a gap between theory and practice, preventing generalizable insights that exceed particular application domains. Here, we propose the Generalized-Distance Transformer (GDT), a GT architecture using standard attention that incorporates many advancements for GTs from recent years, and develop a fine-grained understanding of the GDT's representation power in terms of attention and PEs. Through extensive experiments, we identify design choices that consistently perform well across various applications, tasks, and model scales, demonstrating strong performance in a few-shot transfer setting without fine-tuning. Our evaluation covers over eight million graphs with roughly 270M tokens across diverse domains, including image-based object detection, molecular property prediction, code summarization, and out-of-distribution algorithmic reasoning. We distill our theoretical and practical findings into several generalizable insights about effective GT design, training, and inference.

TL;DR: 提出了递归决策聚焦学习(R-DFL)框架，通过在下游优化和上游预测之间引入双向反馈，克服了传统顺序决策聚焦学习(S-DFL)的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统顺序决策聚焦学习(S-DFL)无法捕捉复杂交互场景中预测与优化之间的双向反馈，限制了决策质量。

Method: 提出R-DFL框架，扩展了两种微分方法：基于自动微分的显式展开和基于定点方法的隐式微分，以实现高效的梯度传播。

Result: 在报童问题和二分图匹配问题上的实验表明，R-DFL相比顺序基线显著提升了最终决策质量，并在闭环决策问题中展现出强大的适应性。

Conclusion: R-DFL通过引入双向反馈机制，为决策聚焦学习提供了更有效的框架，在复杂交互场景中具有优越性能。

Abstract: Decision-focused learning (DFL) has emerged as a powerful end-to-end alternative to conventional predict-then-optimize (PTO) pipelines by directly optimizing predictive models through downstream decision losses. Existing DFL frameworks are limited by their strictly sequential structure, referred to as sequential DFL (S-DFL). However, S-DFL fails to capture the bidirectional feedback between prediction and optimization in complex interaction scenarios. In view of this, we first time propose recursive decision-focused learning (R-DFL), a novel framework that introduces bidirectional feedback between downstream optimization and upstream prediction. We further extend two distinct differentiation methods: explicit unrolling via automatic differentiation and implicit differentiation based on fixed-point methods, to facilitate efficient gradient propagation in R-DFL. We rigorously prove that both methods achieve comparable gradient accuracy, with the implicit method offering superior computational efficiency. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, including the newsvendor problem and the bipartite matching problem, demonstrate that R-DFL not only substantially enhances the final decision quality over sequential baselines but also exhibits robust adaptability across diverse scenarios in closed-loop decision-making problems.

Conclusion: DynaAct框架能够自动构建紧凑动作空间，有效增强复杂问题解决中的顺序推理，在保持高效推理的同时显著提升性能。

Abstract: In modern sequential decision-making systems, the construction of an optimal candidate action space is critical to efficient inference. However, existing approaches either rely on manually defined action spaces that lack scalability or utilize unstructured spaces that render exhaustive search computationally prohibitive. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named \textsc{DynaAct} for automatically constructing a compact action space to enhance sequential reasoning in complex problem-solving scenarios. Our method first estimates a proxy for the complete action space by extracting general sketches observed in a corpus covering diverse complex reasoning problems using large language models. We then formulate a submodular function that jointly evaluates candidate actions based on their utility to the current state and their diversity, and employ a greedy algorithm to select an optimal candidate set. Extensive experiments on six diverse standard benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly improves overall performance, while maintaining efficient inference without introducing substantial latency. The implementation is available at https://github.com/zhaoxlpku/DynaAct.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究了在线线性回归中特征向量被噪声污染且学习者可以付费降低噪声水平的问题。当噪声协方差已知时，最优遗憾率为√T；当噪声协方差未知时，最优遗憾率变为T^{2/3}。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在特征向量被噪声污染的情况下，学习者可以通过付费来降低噪声水平，这在实践中可能由于使用更昂贵的测量设备或激励数据提供商发布隐私性较低的特征而发生。

Method: 假设特征向量从固定但未知的分布中独立同分布抽取，使用矩阵鞅集中性分析，证明经验损失对所有支付和线性预测器一致收敛于期望损失。

Result: 当支付与噪声协方差映射已知时，忽略对数因子的最优遗憾率为√T；当噪声协方差未知时，最优遗憾率为T^{2/3}（忽略对数因子）。

Conclusion: 在线线性回归中，通过付费降低特征噪声水平是可行的，但最优遗憾率取决于噪声协方差信息是否已知，已知时为√T，未知时为T^{2/3}。

Abstract: We study an online linear regression setting in which the observed feature vectors are corrupted by noise and the learner can pay to reduce the noise level. In practice, this may happen for several reasons: for example, because features can be measured more accurately using more expensive equipment, or because data providers can be incentivized to release less private features. Assuming feature vectors are drawn i.i.d. from a fixed but unknown distribution, we measure the learner's regret against the linear predictor minimizing a notion of loss that combines the prediction error and payment. When the mapping between payments and noise covariance is known, we prove that the rate $\sqrt{T}$ is optimal for regret if logarithmic factors are ignored. When the noise covariance is unknown, we show that the optimal regret rate becomes of order $T^{2/3}$ (ignoring log factors). Our analysis leverages matrix martingale concentration, showing that the empirical loss uniformly converges to the expected one for all payments and linear predictors.

TL;DR: 提出了一种集成融合框架，将梯度提升与模糊规则模型相结合，通过动态控制因子和样本校正机制来提升性能、防止过拟合并保持可解释性。


<details>

Motivation: 模糊规则模型具有良好可解释性但存在设计复杂和大数据集扩展性问题，而梯度提升能提供强大性能。融合两者可以克服各自局限，实现性能与可解释性的平衡。

Method: 集成融合框架：在每次迭代中构建模糊规则模型，通过动态控制因子优化其在整体集成中的贡献，该因子防止模型主导、鼓励多样性、作为正则化参数，并基于验证集反馈进行样本校正调整。

Result: 实验结果表明该框架有效提升了模糊规则模型的性能，特别是在减轻过拟合和规则复杂性方面，同时保持了模型的可解释性。

Conclusion: 通过优化控制因子来管理每个模型的贡献，该框架不仅提升了性能，还维持了可解释性，并简化了模型的维护和更新过程。

Abstract: The integration of different learning paradigms has long been a focus of machine learning research, aimed at overcoming the inherent limitations of individual methods. Fuzzy rule-based models excel in interpretability and have seen widespread application across diverse fields. However, they face challenges such as complex design specifications and scalability issues with large datasets. The fusion of different techniques and strategies, particularly Gradient Boosting, with Fuzzy Rule-Based Models offers a robust solution to these challenges. This paper proposes an Integrated Fusion Framework that merges the strengths of both paradigms to enhance model performance and interpretability. At each iteration, a Fuzzy Rule-Based Model is constructed and controlled by a dynamic factor to optimize its contribution to the overall ensemble. This control factor serves multiple purposes: it prevents model dominance, encourages diversity, acts as a regularization parameter, and provides a mechanism for dynamic tuning based on model performance, thus mitigating the risk of overfitting. Additionally, the framework incorporates a sample-based correction mechanism that allows for adaptive adjustments based on feedback from a validation set. Experimental results substantiate the efficacy of the presented gradient boosting framework for fuzzy rule-based models, demonstrating performance enhancement, especially in terms of mitigating overfitting and complexity typically associated with many rules. By leveraging an optimal factor to govern the contribution of each model, the framework improves performance, maintains interpretability, and simplifies the maintenance and update of the models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI驱动药物发现中属性约束分子生成和编辑的两个主要障碍：(i) 捕获分子结构与多个性质之间复杂关系的挑战；(ii) 分子性质覆盖范围窄和注释不完整削弱了基于性质的模型效果。

Method: 采用分层结构-性质对齐框架，通过支架聚类选择代表性样本，通过辅助VAE选择困难样本，减少预训练数据需求；结合属性相关性感知掩码机制和多样化扰动策略增强稀疏注释下的生成质量。

Conclusion: HSPAG框架有效解决了分子生成和编辑中的数据效率和属性约束问题，为AI驱动的药物发现提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Property-constrained molecular generation and editing are crucial in AI-driven drug discovery but remain hindered by two factors: (i) capturing the complex relationships between molecular structures and multiple properties remains challenging, and (ii) the narrow coverage and incomplete annotations of molecular properties weaken the effectiveness of property-based models. To tackle these limitations, we propose HSPAG, a data-efficient framework featuring hierarchical structure-property alignment. By treating SMILES and molecular properties as complementary modalities, the model learns their relationships at atom, substructure, and whole-molecule levels. Moreover, we select representative samples through scaffold clustering and hard samples via an auxiliary variational auto-encoder (VAE), substantially reducing the required pre-training data. In addition, we incorporate a property relevance-aware masking mechanism and diversified perturbation strategies to enhance generation quality under sparse annotations. Experiments demonstrate that HSPAG captures fine-grained structure-property relationships and supports controllable generation under multiple property constraints. Two real-world case studies further validate the editing capabilities of HSPAG.

TL;DR: HipKittens (HK) 是一个针对 AMD GPU 的编程框架，基于 tile-based 抽象，能够与 AMD 手写汇编内核竞争，并在某些 AI 工作负载中表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AMD GPU 提供最先进的计算和内存带宽，但高性能 AMD 内核通常需要用汇编编写。现有 DSL（如 ThunderKittens）主要针对 NVIDIA 硬件，需要探索这些编程原语是否适用于 AMD GPU。

Method: 开发 HipKittens 框架，采用 tile-based 抽象编程，重新设计适用于 AMD GPU 的算法实现，支持显式的基于 tile 的编程、优化的内存访问和细粒度异步执行。

Result: HK 内核在 CDNA3 和 CDNA4 AMD 平台上与手写汇编内核竞争，在 GEMM 和注意力计算中表现相当，在某些设置下（如 d=64 注意力、GQA 反向传播、内存受限内核）比所有可用内核基线快 1.2-2.4 倍。

Conclusion: Tile-based 抽象可以推广到 AMD GPU，但需要重新设计算法实现。HipKittens 为跨 GPU 厂商的高性能 AI 内核提供了统一的软件层基础。

Abstract: AMD GPUs offer state-of-the-art compute and memory bandwidth; however, peak performance AMD kernels are written in raw assembly. To address the difficulty of mapping AI algorithms to hardware, recent work proposes C++ embedded and PyTorch-inspired domain-specific languages like ThunderKittens (TK) to simplify high performance AI kernel development on NVIDIA hardware. We explore the extent to which such primitives -- for explicit tile-based programming with optimized memory accesses and fine-grained asynchronous execution across workers -- are NVIDIA-specific or general. We provide the first detailed study of the programming primitives that lead to performant AMD AI kernels, and we encapsulate these insights in the HipKittens (HK) programming framework. We find that tile-based abstractions used in prior DSLs generalize to AMD GPUs, however we need to rethink the algorithms that instantiate these abstractions for AMD. We validate the HK primitives across CDNA3 and CDNA4 AMD platforms. In evaluations, HK kernels compete with AMD's hand-optimized assembly kernels for GEMMs and attention, and consistently outperform compiler baselines. Moreover, assembly is difficult to scale to the breadth of AI workloads; reflecting this, in some settings HK outperforms all available kernel baselines by $1.2-2.4\times$ (e.g., $d=64$ attention, GQA backwards, memory-bound kernels). These findings help pave the way for a single, tile-based software layer for high-performance AI kernels that translates across GPU vendors. HipKittens is released at: https://github.com/HazyResearch/HipKittens.

Motivation: 检验动态模型中状态稀疏性和时间稀疏性假设是否在典型强化学习任务中成立，为学习动态模型提供更准确的归纳偏置。

Method: 分析MuJoCo Playground基准套件中机器人强化学习环境的真实动态，研究：(i)环境动态的因果图是否稀疏；(ii)这种稀疏性是否状态依赖；(iii)局部系统动态是否稀疏变化。

Result: 全局稀疏性罕见，但任务在其动态中显示出局部、状态依赖的稀疏性，这种稀疏性表现出特定的结构模式，出现在时间局部化集群中（如接触事件期间）并影响特定的状态维度子集。

Conclusion: 研究结果挑战了动态学习中常见的稀疏性先验假设，强调需要反映真实世界动态状态依赖稀疏性结构的接地归纳偏置。

Abstract: The use of learned dynamics models, also known as world models, can improve the sample efficiency of reinforcement learning. Recent work suggests that the underlying causal graphs of such dynamics models are sparsely connected, with each of the future state variables depending only on a small subset of the current state variables, and that learning may therefore benefit from sparsity priors. Similarly, temporal sparsity, i.e. sparsely and abruptly changing local dynamics, has also been proposed as a useful inductive bias.
  In this work, we critically examine these assumptions by analyzing ground-truth dynamics from a set of robotic reinforcement learning environments in the MuJoCo Playground benchmark suite, aiming to determine whether the proposed notions of state and temporal sparsity actually tend to hold in typical reinforcement learning tasks.
  We study (i) whether the causal graphs of environment dynamics are sparse, (ii) whether such sparsity is state-dependent, and (iii) whether local system dynamics change sparsely.
  Our results indicate that global sparsity is rare, but instead the tasks show local, state-dependent sparsity in their dynamics and this sparsity exhibits distinct structures, appearing in temporally localized clusters (e.g., during contact events) and affecting specific subsets of state dimensions. These findings challenge common sparsity prior assumptions in dynamics learning, emphasizing the need for grounded inductive biases that reflect the state-dependent sparsity structure of real-world dynamics.

Conclusion: SLGNN为图上的深度振荡架构提供了一个新颖、表达力强且理论基础坚实的框架。

Abstract: Oscillatory Graph Neural Networks (OGNNs) are an emerging class of physics-inspired architectures designed to mitigate oversmoothing and vanishing gradient problems in deep GNNs. In this work, we introduce the Complex-Valued Stuart-Landau Graph Neural Network (SLGNN), a novel architecture grounded in Stuart-Landau oscillator dynamics. Stuart-Landau oscillators are canonical models of limit-cycle behavior near Hopf bifurcations, which are fundamental to synchronization theory and are widely used in e.g. neuroscience for mesoscopic brain modeling. Unlike harmonic oscillators and phase-only Kuramoto models, Stuart-Landau oscillators retain both amplitude and phase dynamics, enabling rich phenomena such as amplitude regulation and multistable synchronization. The proposed SLGNN generalizes existing phase-centric Kuramoto-based OGNNs by allowing node feature amplitudes to evolve dynamically according to Stuart-Landau dynamics, with explicit tunable hyperparameters (such as the Hopf-parameter and the coupling strength) providing additional control over the interplay between feature amplitudes and network structure. We conduct extensive experiments across node classification, graph classification, and graph regression tasks, demonstrating that SLGNN outperforms existing OGNNs and establishes a novel, expressive, and theoretically grounded framework for deep oscillatory architectures on graphs.

Method: 提出综合评估协议，适用于批处理和流式学习场景，通过在多样化分类任务上使用多种模型类型进行实验。

Result: 传统静态训练-测试评估无法可靠捕捉数据演变和重复模型更新下的可持续性；长期可持续性在不同模型间差异显著；在许多情况下，更高的环境成本带来的性能收益很小。

Conclusion: 需要新的评估协议来准确评估AI系统的长期可持续性，传统方法不足以反映真实部署环境下的环境影响。

Abstract: Sustainability and efficiency have become essential considerations in the development and deployment of Artificial Intelligence systems, yet existing regulatory and reporting practices lack standardized, model-agnostic evaluation protocols. Current assessments often measure only short-term experimental resource usage and disproportionately emphasize batch learning settings, failing to reflect real-world, long-term AI lifecycles. In this work, we propose a comprehensive evaluation protocol for assessing the long-term sustainability of ML models, applicable to both batch and streaming learning scenarios. Through experiments on diverse classification tasks using a range of model types, we demonstrate that traditional static train-test evaluations do not reliably capture sustainability under evolving data and repeated model updates. Our results show that long-term sustainability varies significantly across models, and in many cases, higher environmental cost yields little performance benefit.

Conclusion: SafeMIL方法有效解决了离线安全模仿学习问题，通过利用非偏好轨迹学习安全约束，实现了安全性和性能的平衡。

Abstract: In this work, we study the problem of offline safe imitation learning (IL). In many real-world settings, online interactions can be risky, and accurately specifying the reward and the safety cost information at each timestep can be difficult. However, it is often feasible to collect trajectories reflecting undesirable or risky behavior, implicitly conveying the behavior the agent should avoid. We refer to these trajectories as non-preferred trajectories. Unlike standard IL, which aims to mimic demonstrations, our agent must also learn to avoid risky behavior using non-preferred trajectories. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, SafeMIL, to learn a parameterized cost that predicts if the state-action pair is risky via \textit{Multiple Instance Learning}. The learned cost is then used to avoid non-preferred behaviors, resulting in a policy that prioritizes safety. We empirically demonstrate that our approach can learn a safer policy that satisfies cost constraints without degrading the reward performance, thereby outperforming several baselines.

Motivation: 联邦学习虽然保证了负载分布和隐私，但未原生考虑基础设施效率，特别是在资源受限环境中的挑战。现有的基于强化学习的客户端选择方法未充分考虑资源限制、设备流失等基础设施问题，且缺乏通用性和能效优化。

Method: BIPPO是一种节能的多智能体强化学习解决方案，采用改进的采样器，在高度预算受限的环境中运行，处理非独立同分布数据的联邦学习客户端训练。

Result: BIPPO在图像分类任务中相比非RL机制、传统PPO和IPPO提高了平均准确率，仅消耗预算的极小比例，且随着客户端数量增加保持稳定。

Conclusion: BIPPO为物联网-联邦学习中的客户端选择提供了高性能、稳定、可扩展和可持续的解决方案。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a promising machine learning solution in large-scale IoT systems, guaranteeing load distribution and privacy. However, FL does not natively consider infrastructure efficiency, a critical concern for systems operating in resource-constrained environments. Several Reinforcement Learning (RL) based solutions offer improved client selection for FL; however, they do not consider infrastructure challenges, such as resource limitations and device churn. Furthermore, the training of RL methods is often not designed for practical application, as these approaches frequently do not consider generalizability and are not optimized for energy efficiency. To fill this gap, we propose BIPPO (Budget-aware Independent Proximal Policy Optimization), which is an energy-efficient multi-agent RL solution that improves performance. We evaluate BIPPO on two image classification tasks run in a highly budget-constrained setting, with FL clients training on non-IID data, a challenging context for vanilla FL. The improved sampler of BIPPO enables it to increase the mean accuracy compared to non-RL mechanisms, traditional PPO, and IPPO. In addition, BIPPO only consumes a negligible proportion of the budget, which stays consistent even if the number of clients increases. Overall, BIPPO delivers a performant, stable, scalable, and sustainable solution for client selection in IoT-FL.

Conclusion: 所提出的神经CFR算法成功克服了现有方法在近似高级CFR变体方面的局限性，为大规模非完全信息游戏提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Counterfactual regret minimization (CFR) is a family of algorithms for effectively solving imperfect-information games. To enhance CFR's applicability in large games, researchers use neural networks to approximate its behavior. However, existing methods are mainly based on vanilla CFR and struggle to effectively integrate more advanced CFR variants. In this work, we propose an efficient model-free neural CFR algorithm, overcoming the limitations of existing methods in approximating advanced CFR variants. At each iteration, it collects variance-reduced sampled advantages based on a value network, fits cumulative advantages by bootstrapping, and applies discounting and clipping operations to simulate the update mechanisms of advanced CFR variants. Experimental results show that, compared with model-free neural algorithms, it exhibits faster convergence in typical imperfect-information games and demonstrates stronger adversarial performance in a large poker game.

Abstract: Learning to simulate complex physical systems from data has emerged as a promising way to overcome the limitations of traditional numerical solvers, which often require prohibitive computational costs for high-fidelity solutions. Recent Graph Neural Simulators (GNSs) accelerate simulations by learning dynamics on graph-structured data, yet often struggle to capture long-range interactions and suffer from error accumulation under autoregressive rollouts. To address these challenges, we propose Information-preserving Graph Neural Simulators (IGNS), a graph-based neural simulator built on the principles of Hamiltonian dynamics. This structure guarantees preservation of information across the graph, while extending to port-Hamiltonian systems allows the model to capture a broader class of dynamics, including non-conservative effects. IGNS further incorporates a warmup phase to initialize global context, geometric encoding to handle irregular meshes, and a multi-step training objective to reduce rollout error. To evaluate these properties systematically, we introduce new benchmarks that target long-range dependencies and challenging external forcing scenarios. Across all tasks, IGNS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GNSs, achieving higher accuracy and stability under challenging and complex dynamical systems.

Conclusion: 在线数据集压缩可能是实现完全无偏持续学习的必要条件，OPRE方法仅需对数据做出最小且可解释的假设。

Abstract: In order to achieve Continual Learning (CL), the problem of catastrophic forgetting, one that has plagued neural networks since their inception, must be overcome. The evaluation of continual learning methods relies on splitting a known homogeneous dataset and learning the associated tasks one after the other. We argue that most CL methods introduce a priori information about the data to come and cannot be considered agnostic. We exemplify this point with the case of methods relying on pretrained feature extractors, which are still used in CL. After showing that pretrained feature extractors imply a loss of generality with respect to the data that can be learned by the model, we then discuss other kinds of a priori information introduced in other CL methods. We then present the Online Patch Redundancy Eliminator (OPRE), an online dataset compression algorithm, which, along with the training of a classifier at test time, yields performance on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 superior to a number of other state-of-the-art online continual learning methods. Additionally, OPRE requires only minimal and interpretable hypothesis on the data to come. We suggest that online dataset compression could well be necessary to achieve fully agnostic CL.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is critical for decision-making across dynamic domains such as energy, finance, transportation, and cloud computing. However, real-world time series often exhibit non-stationarity, including temporal distribution shifts and spectral variability, which pose significant challenges for long-term time series forecasting. In this paper, we propose DTAF, a dual-branch framework that addresses non-stationarity in both the temporal and frequency domains. For the temporal domain, the Temporal Stabilizing Fusion (TFS) module employs a non-stationary mix of experts (MOE) filter to disentangle and suppress temporal non-stationary patterns while preserving long-term dependencies. For the frequency domain, the Frequency Wave Modeling (FWM) module applies frequency differencing to dynamically highlight components with significant spectral shifts. By fusing the complementary outputs of TFS and FWM, DTAF generates robust forecasts that adapt to both temporal and frequency domain non-stationarity. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmarks demonstrate that DTAF outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, yielding significant improvements in forecasting accuracy under non-stationary conditions.

*Zhihao Lin,Lin Wu,Zhen Tian,Jianglin Lan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PrefPoE是一个基于偏好-专家乘积的新探索框架，通过优势引导的智能探索来平衡探索与利用，在多种控制任务中显著提升性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习中的探索仍然是一个关键挑战，朴素的熵最大化通常会导致高方差和低效的策略更新。需要一种更智能的探索方法来稳定策略更新并提高样本效率。

Method: PrefPoE框架训练一个偏好网络来集中概率质量于高优势动作，并通过专家乘积(PoE)融合将其与主策略结合，创建一个软信任区域来稳定策略更新同时保持定向探索。

Result: 在连续和离散动作空间的多样化控制任务中，PrefPoE表现出持续改进：HalfCheetah-v4提升321%(1276→5375)，Ant-v4提升69%，LunarLander-v2提升276%，同时增强了训练稳定性和样本效率。

Conclusion: 通过优势引导的偏好学习探索位置与学习如何行动同样重要，PrefPoE为增强策略梯度方法提供了一个通用框架，能够防止过早收敛并实现更优性能。

Abstract: Exploration in reinforcement learning remains a critical challenge, as naive entropy maximization often results in high variance and inefficient policy updates. We introduce \textbf{PrefPoE}, a novel \textit{Preference-Product-of-Experts} framework that performs intelligent, advantage-guided exploration via the first principled application of product-of-experts (PoE) fusion for single-task exploration-exploitation balancing. By training a preference network to concentrate probability mass on high-advantage actions and fusing it with the main policy through PoE, PrefPoE creates a \textbf{soft trust region} that stabilizes policy updates while maintaining targeted exploration. Across diverse control tasks spanning both continuous and discrete action spaces, PrefPoE demonstrates consistent improvements: +321\% on HalfCheetah-v4 (1276~$\rightarrow$~5375), +69\% on Ant-v4, +276\% on LunarLander-v2, with consistently enhanced training stability and sample efficiency. Unlike standard PPO, which suffers from entropy collapse, PrefPoE sustains adaptive exploration through its unique dynamics, thereby preventing premature convergence and enabling superior performance. Our results establish that learning \textit{where to explore} through advantage-guided preferences is as crucial as learning how to act, offering a general framework for enhancing policy gradient methods across the full spectrum of reinforcement learning domains. Code and pretrained models are available in supplementary materials.

Motivation: Transformer架构虽然在各领域取得了巨大成功，但其核心组件（位置编码和注意力机制）缺乏统一的物理或数学解释，需要建立理论框架来深入理解。

Method: 将离散位置映射到连续流形上的空间函数，从场论角度将Transformer层解释为嵌入流形上的核调制算子。

Result: 建立了一个结构化的理论框架，统一了位置编码、核积分算子和注意力机制，为Transformer提供了数学和物理解释。

Abstract: The Transformer architecture has achieved tremendous success in natural language processing, computer vision, and scientific computing through its self-attention mechanism. However, its core components-positional encoding and attention mechanisms-have lacked a unified physical or mathematical interpretation. This paper proposes a structural theoretical framework that integrates positional encoding, kernel integral operators, and attention mechanisms for in-depth theoretical investigation. We map discrete positions (such as text token indices and image pixel coordinates) to spatial functions on continuous manifolds, enabling a field-theoretic interpretation of Transformer layers as kernel-modulated operators acting over embedded manifolds.

Conclusion: 该方法能够数据驱动地发现任务相关的变量关系，提升临床预测任务的性能，同时保持可解释性。

Abstract: Clinical time series data are critical for patient monitoring and predictive modeling. These time series are typically multivariate and often comprise hundreds of heterogeneous features from different data sources. The grouping of features based on similarity and relevance to the prediction task has been shown to enhance the performance of deep learning architectures. However, defining these groups a priori using only semantic knowledge is challenging, even for domain experts. To address this, we propose a novel method that learns feature groups by clustering weights of feature-wise embedding layers. This approach seamlessly integrates into standard supervised training and discovers the groups that directly improve downstream performance on clinically relevant tasks. We demonstrate that our method outperforms static clustering approaches on synthetic data and achieves performance comparable to expert-defined groups on real-world medical data. Moreover, the learned feature groups are clinically interpretable, enabling data-driven discovery of task-relevant relationships between variables.

Abstract: Feature attribution has gained prominence as a tool for explaining model decisions, yet evaluating explanation quality remains challenging due to the absence of ground-truth explanations. To circumvent this, explanation-guided input manipulation has emerged as an indirect evaluation strategy, measuring explanation effectiveness through the impact of input modifications on model outcomes during inference. Despite the widespread use, a major concern with inference-based schemes is the distribution shift caused by such manipulations, which undermines the reliability of their assessments. The retraining-based scheme ROAR overcomes this issue by adapting the model to the altered data distribution. However, its evaluation results often contradict the theoretical foundations of widely accepted explainers. This work investigates this misalignment between empirical observations and theoretical expectations. In particular, we identify the sign issue as a key factor responsible for residual information that ultimately distorts retraining-based evaluation. Based on the analysis, we show that a straightforward reframing of the evaluation process can effectively resolve the identified issue. Building on the existing framework, we further propose novel variants that jointly structure a comprehensive perspective on explanation evaluation. These variants largely improve evaluation efficiency over the standard retraining protocol, thereby enhancing practical applicability for explainer selection and benchmarking. Following our proposed schemes, empirical results across various data scales provide deeper insights into the performance of carefully selected explainers, revealing open challenges and future directions in explainability research.

Conclusion: 所提出的高效图对比学习框架成功解决了大规模图上的可扩展性问题，在保持强泛化性能的同时显著提升了训练和推理效率。

Abstract: Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in the absence of task-specific labels. However, its scalability on large-scale graphs is hindered by the intensive message passing mechanism of GNN and the quadratic computational complexity of contrastive loss over positive and negative node pairs. To address these issues, we propose an efficient GCL framework that transforms the input graph into a compact network of interconnected node sets while preserving structural information across communities. We firstly introduce a kernelized graph community contrastive loss with linear complexity, enabling effective information transfer among node sets to capture hierarchical structural information of the graph. We then incorporate a knowledge distillation technique into the decoupled GNN architecture to accelerate inference while maintaining strong generalization performance. Extensive experiments on sixteen real-world datasets of varying scales demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art GCL baselines in both effectiveness and scalability.

Result: 在流行的数学基准测试中，该方法在生成多样性和解决方案准确性方面优于普通采样技术。

Conclusion: 测试时黎曼激活引导策略能有效提升语言模型在复杂任务中的推理多样性和准确性。

Abstract: Best-of-$N$ reasoning improves the accuracy of language models in solving complex tasks by sampling multiple candidate solutions and then selecting the best one based on some criteria. A critical bottleneck for this strategy is the output diversity limit, which occurs when the model generates similar outputs despite stochastic sampling, and hence recites the same error. To address this lack of variance in reasoning paths, we propose a novel unsupervised activation steering strategy that simultaneously optimizes the steering vectors for multiple reasoning trajectories at test time. At any synchronization anchor along the batch generation process, we find the steering vectors that maximize the total volume spanned by all possible intervened activation subsets. We demonstrate that these steering vectors can be determined by solving a Riemannian optimization problem over the product of spheres with a log-determinant objective function. We then use a Riemannian block-coordinate descent algorithm with a well-tuned learning rate to obtain a stationary point of the problem, and we apply these steering vectors until the generation process reaches the subsequent synchronization anchor. Empirical evaluations on popular mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that our test-time Riemannian activation steering strategy outperforms vanilla sampling techniques in terms of generative diversity and solution accuracy.

TL;DR: MolRuleLoss是一个基于子结构替换规则的框架，通过将SSR的偏导数约束整合到分子性质回归模型的损失函数中，显著提升了多个分子性质预测模型的准确性和泛化能力。

Motivation: AI辅助药物发现中，分子性质预测模型在回归任务中准确性差，且对分布外分子预测性能严重下降，需要提升模型的准确性和泛化能力。

Method: 提出MolRuleLoss框架，将子结构替换规则的偏导数约束整合到分子性质回归模型的损失函数中，利用SSR的数量和质量来提升预测性能。

Result: 在多个分子性质预测任务中，MolRuleLoss显著降低了RMSE值（提升2.6-33.3%），改善了模型对'活性悬崖'分子和分布外分子的泛化能力，在分子量预测任务中将RMSE从29.507降至0.007。

Conclusion: MolRuleLoss作为附加组件能够有效提升多种分子性质回归模型的预测准确性和泛化能力，支持化学信息学和AI辅助药物发现等领域的应用。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI)-aided drug discovery is an active research field, yet AI models often exhibit poor accuracy in regression tasks for molecular property prediction, and perform catastrophically poorly for out-of-distribution (OOD) molecules. Here, we present MolRuleLoss, a substructure-substitution-rule-informed framework that improves the accuracy and generalizability of multiple molecular property regression models (MPRMs) such as GEM and UniMol for diverse molecular property prediction tasks. MolRuleLoss incorporates partial derivative constraints for substructure substitution rules (SSRs) into an MPRM's loss function. When using GEM models for predicting lipophilicity, water solubility, and solvation-free energy (using lipophilicity, ESOL, and freeSolv datasets from MoleculeNet), the root mean squared error (RMSE) values with and without MolRuleLoss were 0.587 vs. 0.660, 0.777 vs. 0.798, and 1.252 vs. 1.877, respectively, representing 2.6-33.3% performance improvements. We show that both the number and the quality of SSRs contribute to the magnitude of prediction accuracy gains obtained upon adding MolRuleLoss to an MPRM. MolRuleLoss improved the generalizability of MPRMs for "activity cliff" molecules in a lipophilicity prediction task and improved the generalizability of MPRMs for OOD molecules in a melting point prediction task. In a molecular weight prediction task for OOD molecules, MolRuleLoss reduced the RMSE value of a GEM model from 29.507 to 0.007. We also provide a formal demonstration that the upper bound of the variation for property change of SSRs is positively correlated with an MPRM's error. Together, we show that using the MolRuleLoss framework as a bolt-on boosts the prediction accuracy and generalizability of multiple MPRMs, supporting diverse applications in areas like cheminformatics and AI-aided drug discovery.

Motivation: 大语言模型推理需要大量计算资源，动态剪枝虽然比静态方法更高效，但会加剧对齐退化问题，因为只保留输入相关的安全关键电路。解决这些增强的对齐漏洞至关重要。

Method: 基于Probe Pruning，提出Alignment-Aware Probe Pruning (AAPP)方法，在推理过程中自适应地保留对齐相关电路。

Conclusion: AAPP实现了高效且安全保持的LLM部署，解决了动态剪枝带来的对齐退化问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models require substantial computational resources for inference, posing deployment challenges. While dynamic pruning offers superior efficiency over static methods through adaptive circuit selection, it exacerbates alignment degradation by retaining only input-dependent safety-critical circuit preservation across diverse inputs. As a result, addressing these heightened alignment vulnerabilities remains critical. We introduce Alignment-Aware Probe Pruning (AAPP), a dynamic structured pruning method that adaptively preserves alignment-relevant circuits during inference, building upon Probe Pruning. Experiments on LLaMA 2-7B, Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct, and Gemma-3-12B-IT show AAPP improves refusal rates by 50\% at matched compute, enabling efficient yet safety-preserving LLM deployment.

Abstract: With the growing adoption of AI and machine learning systems in real-world applications, ensuring their fairness has become increasingly critical. The majority of the work in algorithmic fairness focus on assessing and improving the fairness of machine learning systems. There is relatively little research on fairness vulnerability, i.e., how an AI system's fairness can be intentionally compromised. In this work, we first provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that a simple adversarial poisoning strategy is sufficient to induce maximally unfair behavior in naive Bayes classifiers. Our key idea is to strategically inject a small fraction of carefully crafted adversarial data points into the training set, biasing the model's decision boundary to disproportionately affect a protected group while preserving generalizable performance. To illustrate the practical effectiveness of our method, we conduct experiments across several benchmark datasets and models. We find that our attack significantly outperforms existing methods in degrading fairness metrics across multiple models and datasets, often achieving substantially higher levels of unfairness with a comparable or only slightly worse impact on accuracy. Notably, our method proves effective on a wide range of models, in contrast to prior work, demonstrating a robust and potent approach to compromising the fairness of machine learning systems.

Motivation: 机器学习系统存在多种失败模式（不公平性、对虚假相关性的脆弱性、少数子群体性能差等），这些通常被不同研究社区孤立研究。需要统一框架来理解这些偏差机制之间的内在联系。

Method: 使用信息论方法将偏差形式化为条件独立性违反，通过理论推导证明不同偏差机制之间的等价条件。在6个数据集和3种架构上进行实证验证。

Result: 理论预测虚假相关性强度α与子群体不平衡比率r≈(1+α)/(1-α)在最坏组精度下降上等效。实证验证显示预测等价关系在最坏组精度3%范围内成立，使去偏差方法能够在不同问题领域间迁移。

Conclusion: 该工作将公平性、鲁棒性和分布偏移的文献统一在共同视角下，为跨问题领域的偏差理解和缓解提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Machine learning systems exhibit diverse failure modes: unfairness toward protected groups, brittleness to spurious correlations, poor performance on minority sub-populations, which are typically studied in isolation by distinct research communities. We propose a unifying theoretical framework that characterizes when different bias mechanisms produce quantitatively equivalent effects on model performance. By formalizing biases as violations of conditional independence through information-theoretic measures, we prove formal equivalence conditions relating spurious correlations, subpopulation shift, class imbalance, and fairness violations. Our theory predicts that a spurious correlation of strength $α$ produces equivalent worst-group accuracy degradation as a sub-population imbalance ratio $r \approx (1+α)/(1-α)$ under feature overlap assumptions. Empirical validation in six datasets and three architectures confirms that predicted equivalences hold within the accuracy of the worst group 3\%, enabling the principled transfer of debiasing methods across problem domains. This work bridges the literature on fairness, robustness, and distribution shifts under a common perspective.

Conclusion: LPPG-RL是一个广泛兼容所有策略梯度算法的框架，能有效解决连续空间中的词典序多目标强化学习问题。

Abstract: Lexicographic multi-objective problems, which consist of multiple conflicting subtasks with explicit priorities, are common in real-world applications. Despite the advantages of Reinforcement Learning (RL) in single tasks, extending conventional RL methods to prioritized multiple objectives remains challenging. In particular, traditional Safe RL and Multi-Objective RL (MORL) methods have difficulty enforcing priority orderings efficiently. Therefore, Lexicographic Multi-Objective RL (LMORL) methods have been developed to address these challenges. However, existing LMORL methods either rely on heuristic threshold tuning with prior knowledge or are restricted to discrete domains. To overcome these limitations, we propose Lexicographically Projected Policy Gradient RL (LPPG-RL), a novel LMORL framework which leverages sequential gradient projections to identify feasible policy update directions, thereby enabling LPPG-RL broadly compatible with all policy gradient algorithms in continuous spaces. LPPG-RL reformulates the projection step as an optimization problem, and utilizes Dykstra's projection rather than generic solvers to deliver great speedups, especially for small- to medium-scale instances. In addition, LPPG-RL introduces Subproblem Exploration (SE) to prevent gradient vanishing, accelerate convergence and enhance stability. We provide theoretical guarantees for convergence and establish a lower bound on policy improvement. Finally, through extensive experiments in a 2D navigation environment, we demonstrate the effectiveness of LPPG-RL, showing that it outperforms existing state-of-the-art continuous LMORL methods.

Conclusion: 超网络驱动的参数化为在复杂场景中增强现有预测技术提供了一个有前景的方向。

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of multivariate time series data remains a formidable challenge, particularly due to the growing complexity of temporal dependencies in real-world scenarios. While neural network-based models have achieved notable success in this domain, complex channel-dependent models often suffer from performance degradation compared to channel-independent models that do not consider the relationship between components but provide high robustness due to small capacity. In this work, we propose HN-MVTS, a novel architecture that integrates a hypernetwork-based generative prior with an arbitrary neural network forecasting model. The input of this hypernetwork is a learnable embedding matrix of time series components. To restrict the number of new parameters, the hypernetwork learns to generate the weights of the last layer of the target forecasting networks, serving as a data-adaptive regularizer that improves generalization and long-range predictive accuracy. The hypernetwork is used only during the training, so it does not increase the inference time compared to the base forecasting model. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that application of HN-MVTS to the state-of-the-art models (DLinear, PatchTST, TSMixer, etc.) typically improves their performance. Our findings suggest that hypernetwork-driven parameterization offers a promising direction for enhancing existing forecasting techniques in complex scenarios.

Abstract: The complexity and opacity of neural networks (NNs) pose significant challenges, particularly in high-stakes fields such as healthcare, finance, and law, where understanding decision-making processes is crucial. To address these issues, the field of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has developed various methods aimed at clarifying AI decision-making, thereby facilitating appropriate trust and validating the fairness of outcomes. Among these methods, prototype-based explanations offer a promising approach that uses representative examples to elucidate model behavior. However, a critical gap exists regarding standardized benchmarks to objectively compare prototype-based XAI methods, especially in the context of time series data. This lack of reliable benchmarks results in subjective evaluations, hindering progress in the field. We aim to establish a robust framework, ProtoScore, for assessing prototype-based XAI methods across different data types with a focus on time series data, facilitating fair and comprehensive evaluations. By integrating the Co-12 properties of Nauta et al., this framework allows for effectively comparing prototype methods against each other and against other XAI methods, ultimately assisting practitioners in selecting appropriate explanation methods while minimizing the costs associated with user studies.

### [129] [One Router to Route Them All: Homogeneous Expert Routing for Heterogeneous Graph Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07603)
*Georgiy Shakirov,Albert Arakelov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Homogeneous Expert Routing (HER)方法，在异质图神经网络中集成混合专家模型，通过随机掩码类型嵌入实现类型无关的专家专业化，提升链接预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统异质图神经网络过度依赖节点/边类型标签，阻碍跨类型知识迁移，需要探索更有效的专家路由机制。

Method: 在Heterogeneous Graph Transformers中引入MoE层，使用随机掩码类型嵌入的Homogeneous Expert Routing，鼓励专家按语义模式而非类型进行专业化。

Result: 在IMDB、ACM和DBLP数据集上的链接预测任务中，HER持续优于标准HGT和类型分离的MoE基线，专家按语义模式（如电影类型）而非节点类型进行专业化。

Conclusion: 通过正则化专家路由中的类型依赖性，可以获得更具泛化性、高效性和可解释性的表示，为异质图学习提供了新的设计原则。

Abstract: A common practice in heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) is to condition parameters on node/edge types, assuming types reflect semantic roles. However, this can cause overreliance on surface-level labels and impede cross-type knowledge transfer. We explore integrating Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) into HGNNs--a direction underexplored despite MoE's success in homogeneous settings. Crucially, we question the need for type-specific experts. We propose Homogeneous Expert Routing (HER), an MoE layer for Heterogeneous Graph Transformers (HGT) that stochastically masks type embeddings during routing to encourage type-agnostic specialization. Evaluated on IMDB, ACM, and DBLP for link prediction, HER consistently outperforms standard HGT and a type-separated MoE baseline. Analysis on IMDB shows HER experts specialize by semantic patterns (e.g., movie genres) rather than node types, confirming routing is driven by latent semantics. Our work demonstrates that regularizing type dependence in expert routing yields more generalizable, efficient, and interpretable representations--a new design principle for heterogeneous graph learning.

*Soham Basu,Frank Hutter,Danny Stoll*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PriMO是首个能够整合多目标用户先验知识的超参数优化算法，在单目标和多目标设置下均达到最先进性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的超参数优化算法很少能利用专家的先验知识，且没有算法能整合多目标先验知识，而深度学习实践者通常需要优化多个目标

Method: 开发了PriMO算法，能够整合多目标用户信念

Result: 在8个深度学习基准测试中，PriMO在单目标和多目标设置下均达到最先进性能

Conclusion: PriMO成为深度学习实践者的新首选超参数优化算法

Abstract: While Deep Learning (DL) experts often have prior knowledge about which hyperparameter settings yield strong performance, only few Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) algorithms can leverage such prior knowledge and none incorporate priors over multiple objectives. As DL practitioners often need to optimize not just one but many objectives, this is a blind spot in the algorithmic landscape of HPO. To address this shortcoming, we introduce PriMO, the first HPO algorithm that can integrate multi-objective user beliefs. We show PriMO achieves state-of-the-art performance across 8 DL benchmarks in the multi-objective and single-objective setting, clearly positioning itself as the new go-to HPO algorithm for DL practitioners.

*Zhiwei Zhang,Xinyi Du,Xuanchi Guo,Weihao Wang,Wenjuan Han*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EMAformer通过引入三个关键归纳偏置来增强Transformer架构，在多元时间序列预测任务中实现了最先进的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Transformer架构在多元时间序列预测中表现仍落后于最新的MLP模型，作者认为这是由于不稳定的通道间关系导致的。

Method: 提出EMAformer模型，通过引入全局稳定性、相位敏感性和跨轴特异性三个归纳偏置来增强Transformer，类似于为其配备强化装甲。

Result: 在12个真实世界基准测试中达到最先进性能，平均将预测误差在MSE上降低2.73%，在MAE上降低5.15%。

Conclusion: EMAformer显著推进了基于Transformer的方法在多元时间序列预测中的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting is crucial across a wide range of domains. While presenting notable progress for the Transformer architecture, iTransformer still lags behind the latest MLP-based models. We attribute this performance gap to unstable inter-channel relationships. To bridge this gap, we propose EMAformer, a simple yet effective model that enhances the Transformer with an auxiliary embedding suite, akin to armor that reinforces its ability. By introducing three key inductive biases, i.e., \textit{global stability}, \textit{phase sensitivity}, and \textit{cross-axis specificity}, EMAformer unlocks the further potential of the Transformer architecture, achieving state-of-the-art performance on 12 real-world benchmarks and reducing forecasting errors by an average of 2.73\% in MSE and 5.15\% in MAE. This significantly advances the practical applicability of Transformer-based approaches for multivariate time series forecasting. The code is available on https://github.com/PlanckChang/EMAformer.

### [132] [Private-RAG: Answering Multiple Queries with LLMs while Keeping Your Data Private](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07637)
*Ruihan Wu,Erchi Wang,Zhiyuan Zhang,Yu-Xiang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了两种多查询差分隐私RAG算法：MURAG和MURAG-ADA，能够在数百次查询中保护敏感信息，同时保持实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的差分隐私RAG方法仅适用于单查询场景，无法满足实际使用需求，需要开发能够处理多查询场景的隐私保护方案。

Method: MURAG使用个体隐私过滤器，使累积隐私损失仅取决于文档被检索的频率而非查询总数；MURAG-ADA通过私有发布查询特定阈值，进一步提高了文档选择精度。

Result: 在多个LLM和数据集上的实验表明，所提方法能在实用DP预算（ε≈10）下扩展到数百次查询，同时保持有意义的实用性。

Conclusion: 提出的多查询DP-RAG算法为实际应用场景提供了可行的隐私保护解决方案，在保护敏感信息的同时维持了系统效用。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by retrieving documents from an external corpus at inference time. When this corpus contains sensitive information, however, unprotected RAG systems are at risk of leaking private information. Prior work has introduced differential privacy (DP) guarantees for RAG, but only in single-query settings, which fall short of realistic usage. In this paper, we study the more practical multi-query setting and propose two DP-RAG algorithms. The first, MURAG, leverages an individual privacy filter so that the accumulated privacy loss only depends on how frequently each document is retrieved rather than the total number of queries. The second, MURAG-ADA, further improves utility by privately releasing query-specific thresholds, enabling more precise selection of relevant documents. Our experiments across multiple LLMs and datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods scale to hundreds of queries within a practical DP budget ($\varepsilon\approx10$), while preserving meaningful utility.

*Hua Ye,Hang Ding,Siyuan Chen,Yiyang Jiang,Changyuan Zhang,Xuan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BACL是一个轻量级模块，通过边界感知课程学习和对比局部注意力，将多模态模型中的模糊负样本转化为课程信号，显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大多数多模态模型对所有负样本一视同仁，忽略了那些与正样本仅存在微小差异的模糊负样本。这些边界案例包含重要的学习信号。

Method: 提出边界感知课程学习与局部注意力（BACL），包含边界感知负采样器和对比局部注意力损失。前者逐步增加难度，后者突出不匹配位置。两个模块完全可微分，可与任何现成的双编码器配合使用。

Result: 理论预测误差率为O(1/n)；实践显示在四个大规模基准测试中，相比CLIP提升高达32%的R@1，并创造了新的SOTA，且无需额外标签。

Conclusion: BACL通过有效利用模糊负样本作为课程信号，显著提升了多模态模型的性能，在理论和实践上都取得了优异成果。

Abstract: Most multimodal models treat every negative pair alike, ignoring the ambiguous negatives that differ from the positive by only a small detail. We propose Boundary-Aware Curriculum with Local Attention (BACL), a lightweight add-on that turns these borderline cases into a curriculum signal. A Boundary-aware Negative Sampler gradually raises difficulty, while a Contrastive Local Attention loss highlights where the mismatch occurs. The two modules are fully differentiable and work with any off-the-shelf dual encoder. Theory predicts a fast O(1/n) error rate; practice shows up to +32% R@1 over CLIP and new SOTA on four large-scale benchmarks, all without extra labels.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了ARAC算法，结合注意力图神经网络和自适应发散正则化机制，解决图结构多智能体强化学习中的稀疏奖励问题，在追捕和对抗任务中表现出更好的收敛性和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在图结构多智能体强化学习的对抗任务中，稀疏奖励阻碍了策略学习效率，需要协调高度动态的智能体交互。

Method: 使用注意力图神经网络建模智能体依赖关系，结合自适应发散正则化机制：早期利用参考策略进行高效探索，后期减少依赖以避免继承其局限性。

Result: 在追捕和对抗场景中，ARAC相比基线方法实现了更快的收敛速度、更高的最终成功率，并在不同智能体数量下表现出更强的可扩展性。

Conclusion: ARAC在复杂图结构环境中有效解决了稀疏奖励问题，通过自适应正则化机制平衡了探索效率和策略优化。

Abstract: In graph-structured multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) adversarial tasks such as pursuit and confrontation, agents must coordinate under highly dynamic interactions, where sparse rewards hinder efficient policy learning. We propose Adaptive Regularized Multi-Agent Soft Actor-Critic (ARAC), which integrates an attention-based graph neural network (GNN) for modeling agent dependencies with an adaptive divergence regularization mechanism. The GNN enables expressive representation of spatial relations and state features in graph environments. Divergence regularization can serve as policy guidance to alleviate the sparse reward problem, but it may lead to suboptimal convergence when the reference policy itself is imperfect. The adaptive divergence regularization mechanism enables the framework to exploit reference policies for efficient exploration in the early stages, while gradually reducing reliance on them as training progresses to avoid inheriting their limitations. Experiments in pursuit and confrontation scenarios demonstrate that ARAC achieves faster convergence, higher final success rates, and stronger scalability across varying numbers of agents compared with MARL baselines, highlighting its effectiveness in complex graph-structured environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NeuCLIP提出了一种新的优化框架，通过凸分析和变分分析将对比损失重新表述，使用紧凑神经网络预测对数归一化因子，解决了CLIP训练中归一化项估计的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CLIP训练方法依赖大批次来估计归一化项，计算资源需求高。现有方法存在优化误差随数据集大小与批次大小比例缩放的问题，限制了在大数据集或小批次下的有效性。

Method: 通过凸分析将每个样本的对比损失重新表述为带辅助变量的最小化问题，然后通过变分分析将n个辅助变量的最小化转化为紧凑神经网络的最小化，设计交替优化算法联合训练CLIP模型和辅助网络。

Result: 在从数百万到数十亿样本的大规模CLIP训练实验中，NeuCLIP相比先前方法实现了更准确的归一化因子估计，获得了更好的性能表现。

Conclusion: NeuCLIP通过创新的优化框架和专门的网络架构，有效解决了CLIP训练中的归一化项估计问题，在大规模数据集上表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Accurately estimating the normalization term (also known as the partition function) in the contrastive loss is a central challenge for training Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models. Conventional methods rely on large batches for approximation, demanding substantial computational resources. To mitigate this issue, prior works introduced per-sample normalizer estimators, which are updated at each epoch in a blockwise coordinate manner to keep track of updated encoders. However, this scheme incurs optimization error that scales with the ratio of dataset size to batch size, limiting effectiveness for large datasets or small batches. To overcome this limitation, we propose NeuCLIP, a novel and elegant optimization framework based on two key ideas: (i) $\textbf{reformulating}$ the contrastive loss for each sample $\textbf{via convex analysis}$ into a minimization problem with an auxiliary variable representing its log-normalizer; and (ii) $\textbf{transforming}$ the resulting minimization over $n$ auxiliary variables (where $n$ is the dataset size) via $\textbf{variational analysis}$ into the minimization over a compact neural network that predicts the log-normalizers. We design an alternating optimization algorithm that jointly trains the CLIP model and the auxiliary network. By employing a tailored architecture and acceleration techniques for the auxiliary network, NeuCLIP achieves more accurate normalizer estimation, leading to improved performance compared with previous methods. Extensive experiments on large-scale CLIP training, spanning datasets from millions to billions of samples, demonstrate that NeuCLIP outperforms previous methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于物理信息的神经算子（PINO）方法来解决心脏电生理学中的PDE问题，相比传统数值求解器和PINNs，PINO能够泛化到多种网格分辨率和初始条件，实现长期稳定预测和零样本评估。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数值求解器计算成本高且对离散化敏感，深度学习模型需要大量数据且难以处理混沌动力学和长期预测，PINNs受限于网格分辨率和长期预测稳定性。

Method: 使用物理信息神经算子（PINO）方法，学习函数空间之间的映射关系，能够处理多种网格分辨率和初始条件。

Conclusion: PINO方法为高效、可扩展的心脏电生理模拟提供了有前景的解决方案，具有泛化能力强、预测稳定和计算效率高的优势。

Abstract: Accurately simulating systems governed by PDEs, such as voltage fields in cardiac electrophysiology (EP) modelling, remains a significant modelling challenge. Traditional numerical solvers are computationally expensive and sensitive to discretisation, while canonical deep learning methods are data-hungry and struggle with chaotic dynamics and long-term predictions. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) mitigate some of these issues by incorporating physical constraints in the learning process, yet they remain limited by mesh resolution and long-term predictive stability. In this work, we propose a Physics-Informed Neural Operator (PINO) approach to solve PDE problems in cardiac EP. Unlike PINNs, PINO models learn mappings between function spaces, allowing them to generalise to multiple mesh resolutions and initial conditions. Our results show that PINO models can accurately reproduce cardiac EP dynamics over extended time horizons and across multiple propagation scenarios, including zero-shot evaluations on scenarios unseen during training. Additionally, our PINO models maintain high predictive quality in long roll-outs (where predictions are recursively fed back as inputs), and can scale their predictive resolution by up to 10x the training resolution. These advantages come with a significant reduction in simulation time compared to numerical PDE solvers, highlighting the potential of PINO-based approaches for efficient and scalable cardiac EP simulations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于投影的方法在整个采样路径上施加约束过于严格，会降低样本质量，而许多下游应用需要在生成样本上强制执行硬约束

Method: 利用流匹配模型的结构和模型预测控制技术，将复杂约束优化问题转化为可高效求解的替代问题，通过轨迹优化在终端时间满足约束

Result: 在机器人规划、偏微分方程边界控制和文本引导图像编辑等领域的实验表明，HardFlow在约束满足和样本质量方面显著优于现有方法

Conclusion: 该框架不仅能够精确满足硬约束，还提供了超越约束满足的灵活性，可以包含积分成本来最小化分布偏移和终端目标来进一步提高样本质量

Abstract: Diffusion and flow-matching have emerged as powerful methodologies for generative modeling, with remarkable success in capturing complex data distributions and enabling flexible guidance at inference time. Many downstream applications, however, demand enforcing hard constraints on generated samples (for example, robot trajectories must avoid obstacles), a requirement that goes beyond simple guidance. Prevailing projection-based approaches constrain the entire sampling path to the constraint manifold, which is overly restrictive and degrades sample quality. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework that reformulates hard-constrained sampling as a trajectory optimization problem. Our key insight is to leverage numerical optimal control to steer the sampling trajectory so that constraints are satisfied precisely at the terminal time. By exploiting the underlying structure of flow-matching models and adopting techniques from model predictive control, we transform this otherwise complex constrained optimization problem into a tractable surrogate that can be solved efficiently and effectively. Furthermore, this trajectory optimization perspective offers significant flexibility beyond mere constraint satisfaction, allowing for the inclusion of integral costs to minimize distribution shift and terminal objectives to further enhance sample quality, all within a unified framework. We provide a control-theoretic analysis of our method, establishing bounds on the approximation error between our tractable surrogate and the ideal formulation. Extensive experiments across diverse domains, including robotics (planning), partial differential equations (boundary control), and vision (text-guided image editing), demonstrate that our algorithm, which we name $\textit{HardFlow}$, substantially outperforms existing methods in both constraint satisfaction and sample quality.

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于连贯性概念的自我改进原则框架，通过投影机制更新模型使其在任务保持变换下保持输出一致性，并提供理论保证实现单调改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自我改进方法主要依赖经验启发式方法，缺乏形式化保证，需要建立一个具有理论保证的原则性自我改进框架。

Method: 使用基于投影的机制，通过更新基线模型使其在任务保持变换下保持连贯性，同时尽可能接近原始行为，包括直接投影和两步投影方法。

Result: 提供了严格的单调改进理论保证，通过预期Bregman散度的减少来衡量改进，并在不可实现设置、经验分布和松弛连贯性约束下扩展了这些保证。

Conclusion: 建立了特征化定理，表明任何具有类似可证明改进保证的机制都必须符合基于连贯性的结构，确立了连贯性作为可证明自我改进的基本和必要原则。

Abstract: Self-improvement is a critical capability for large language models and other intelligent systems, enabling them to refine their behavior and internal consistency without external supervision. Despite its importance, prior approaches largely rely on empirical heuristics and lack formal guarantees. In this paper, we propose a principled framework for self-improvement based on the concept of \emph{coherence}, which requires that a model's outputs remain consistent under task-preserving transformations of the input.
  We formalize this concept using projection-based mechanisms that update a baseline model to be coherent while remaining as close as possible to its original behavior. We provide rigorous theoretical guarantees that these mechanisms achieve \emph{monotonic improvement}, measured by a reduction in expected Bregman divergence. Our analysis is comprehensive, covering both \emph{direct} and \emph{two-step} projection methods, and robustly extends these guarantees to non-realizable settings, empirical (finite-sample) distributions, and relaxed coherence constraints.
  Furthermore, we establish a general \emph{characterization theorem}, showing that any mechanism with similar provable improvement guarantees must inherently conform to a coherence-based structure. This culminates in rigidity results under the demand for universal improvement, establishing coherence as a fundamental and, in a formal sense, necessary principle for provable self-improvement.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出'One Model for All'通用预训练框架，通过解耦学习为单变量预训练和多变量微调两阶段，在EEG情感识别中实现跨数据集的最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG情感识别面临数据集异构性（通道/被试变异性）的挑战，现有方法难以有效迁移知识，需要开发通用模型。

Method: 使用统一通道模式(UCS)进行单变量自监督对比预训练，然后采用ART(自适应重采样Transformer)和GAT(图注意力网络)架构进行多变量微调，捕捉复杂时空依赖关系。

Result: 在SEED(99.27%)、DEAP(93.69%)和DREAMER(93.93%)数据集上实现新的SOTA性能，跨数据集迁移在未见DREAMER数据集上达到94.08%(交集)和93.05%(UCS)。

Conclusion: 该框架为多样化EEG分析任务提供了更通用、可扩展和有效的预训练模型路径。

Abstract: EEG-based emotion recognition is hampered by profound dataset heterogeneity (channel/subject variability), hindering generalizable models. Existing approaches struggle to transfer knowledge effectively. We propose 'One Model for All', a universal pre-training framework for EEG analysis across disparate datasets. Our paradigm decouples learning into two stages: (1) Univariate pre-training via self-supervised contrastive learning on individual channels, enabled by a Unified Channel Schema (UCS) that leverages the channel union (e.g., SEED-62ch, DEAP-32ch); (2) Multivariate fine-tuning with a novel 'ART' (Adaptive Resampling Transformer) and 'GAT' (Graph Attention Network) architecture to capture complex spatio-temporal dependencies. Experiments show universal pre-training is an essential stabilizer, preventing collapse on SEED (vs. scratch) and yielding substantial gains on DEAP (+7.65%) and DREAMER (+3.55%). Our framework achieves new SOTA performance on all within-subject benchmarks: SEED (99.27%), DEAP (93.69%), and DREAMER (93.93%). We also show SOTA cross-dataset transfer, achieving 94.08% (intersection) and 93.05% (UCS) on the unseen DREAMER dataset, with the former surpassing the within-domain pre-training benchmark. Ablation studies validate our architecture: the GAT module is critical, yielding a +22.19% gain over GCN on the high-noise DEAP dataset, and its removal causes a catastrophic -16.44% performance drop. This work paves the way for more universal, scalable, and effective pre-trained models for diverse EEG analysis tasks.

Abstract: In the context of the Classification and Regression Trees (CART) algorithm, the efficient splitting of categorical features using standard criteria like GINI and Entropy is well-established. However, using the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) criterion for categorical features has traditionally relied on various numerical encoding methods. This paper demonstrates that unsupervised numerical encoding methods are not viable for the MAE criteria. Furthermore, we present a novel and efficient splitting algorithm that addresses the challenges of handling categorical features with the MAE criterion. Our findings underscore the limitations of existing approaches and offer a promising solution to enhance the handling of categorical data in CART algorithms.

Abstract: Transmitter localization in Molecular Communication via Diffusion is a critical topic with many applications. However, accurate localization of multiple transmitters is a challenging problem due to the stochastic nature of diffusion and overlapping molecule distributions at the receiver surface. To address these issues, we introduce clustering-based centroid correction methods that enhance robustness against density variations, and outliers. In addition, we propose two clusteringguided Residual Neural Networks, namely AngleNN for direction refinement and SizeNN for cluster size estimation. Experimental results show that both approaches provide significant improvements with reducing localization error between 69% (2-Tx) and 43% (4-Tx) compared to the K-means.

Abstract: Learning manipulable representations of the world and its dynamics is central to AI. Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs) offer a promising blueprint, but lack of practical guidance and theory has led to ad-hoc R&D. We present a comprehensive theory of JEPAs and instantiate it in {\bf LeJEPA}, a lean, scalable, and theoretically grounded training objective. First, we identify the isotropic Gaussian as the optimal distribution that JEPAs' embeddings should follow to minimize downstream prediction risk. Second, we introduce a novel objective--{\bf Sketched Isotropic Gaussian Regularization} (SIGReg)--to constrain embeddings to reach that ideal distribution. Combining the JEPA predictive loss with SIGReg yields LeJEPA with numerous theoretical and practical benefits: (i) single trade-off hyperparameter, (ii) linear time and memory complexity, (iii) stability across hyper-parameters, architectures (ResNets, ViTs, ConvNets) and domains, (iv) heuristics-free, e.g., no stop-gradient, no teacher-student, no hyper-parameter schedulers, and (v) distributed training-friendly implementation requiring only $\approx$50 lines of code. Our empirical validation covers 10+ datasets, 60+ architectures, all with varying scales and domains. As an example, using imagenet-1k for pretraining and linear evaluation with frozen backbone, LeJEPA reaches 79\% with a ViT-H/14. We hope that the simplicity and theory-friendly ecosystem offered by LeJEPA will reestablish self-supervised pre-training as a core pillar of AI research (\href{git@github.com:rbalestr-lab/lejepa.git}{GitHub repo}).

Motivation: 传统的互信息估计方法使用分类器来区分联合分布和边际分布，但这种方法在计算效率和精度方面存在局限，特别是在高维数据和广泛互信息值范围内。

Method: 学习一个归一化流，将联合分布转换为边际分布，从而直接估计互信息，而不是训练分类器进行区分。

Result: 该方法计算效率高、精度好，能够很好地扩展到高维数据，并在广泛的真实互信息值范围内表现良好。

Conclusion: 通过重新构建互信息估计问题，使用归一化流方法提供了一种计算高效且精确的互信息估计解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce a novel Mutual Information (MI) estimator that fundamentally reframes the discriminative approach. Instead of training a classifier to discriminate between joint and marginal distributions, we learn a normalizing flow that transforms one into the other. This technique produces a computationally efficient and precise MI estimate that scales well to high dimensions and across a wide range of ground-truth MI values.

TL;DR: RLVR（带可验证奖励的强化学习）通过非主方向权重更新实现性能提升，其参数稀疏性是模型条件优化偏差的表面现象，而非真实稀疏性。

Motivation: 解释RLVR中看似参数稀疏的悖论，揭示其背后的优化动态机制，理解RL与SFT在参数空间中的本质差异。

Method: 提出三门理论：KL锚定门约束KL散度，模型几何门引导更新到低曲率子空间，精度门隐藏非偏好区域的微更新。通过参数级分析验证理论。

Result: RLVR在权重空间的非主方向学习，通过最小谱漂移、减少主子空间旋转和非主方向更新对齐实现性能增益，与SFT的主权重目标形成鲜明对比。

Conclusion: RL在优化机制上与SFT存在本质差异，直接套用SFT时代的参数高效微调方法存在缺陷，需要设计几何感知的RLVR原生学习算法。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) reliably improves the reasoning performance of large language models, yet it appears to modify only a small fraction of parameters. We revisit this paradox and show that sparsity is a surface artifact of a model-conditioned optimization bias: for a fixed pretrained model, updates consistently localize to preferred parameter regions, highly consistent across runs and largely invariant to datasets and RL recipes. We mechanistically explain these dynamics with a Three-Gate Theory: Gate I (KL Anchor) imposes a KL-constrained update; Gate II (Model Geometry) steers the step off principal directions into low-curvature, spectrum-preserving subspaces; and Gate III (Precision) hides micro-updates in non-preferred regions, making the off-principal bias appear as sparsity. We then validate this theory and, for the first time, provide a parameter-level characterization of RLVR's learning dynamics: RLVR learns off principal directions in weight space, achieving gains via minimal spectral drift, reduced principal-subspace rotation, and off-principal update alignment. In contrast, SFT targets principal weights, distorts the spectrum, and even lags RLVR.
  Together, these results provide the first parameter-space account of RLVR's training dynamics, revealing clear regularities in how parameters evolve. Crucially, we show that RL operates in a distinct optimization regime from SFT, so directly adapting SFT-era parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods can be flawed, as evidenced by our case studies on advanced sparse fine-tuning and LoRA variants. We hope this work charts a path toward a white-box understanding of RLVR and the design of geometry-aware, RLVR-native learning algorithms, rather than repurposed SFT-era heuristics.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原KAN架构需要在训练过程中手动调整域网格，给用户带来额外负担，且标准KAN层无法根据前层输出范围的变化自主更新其域。

Method: 提出AdaptKAN，采用数据驱动的方式自动调整域网格，该直方图算法还可用于检测各种设置中的分布外输入。

Result: 在四个任务中表现优异：学习Feynman数据集中的科学方程、基于冻结特征的图像分类、学习控制Lyapunov函数、以及在OpenOOD v1.5基准上检测OOD输入。

Conclusion: AdaptKAN在多个任务中达到或超越了先前KAN架构和MLPs的性能，同时解决了域网格调整的问题。

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) are a class of neural networks that have received increased attention in recent literature. In contrast to MLPs, KANs leverage parameterized, trainable activation functions and offer several benefits including improved interpretability and higher accuracy on learning symbolic equations. However, the original KAN architecture requires adjustments to the domain discretization of the network (called the "domain grid") during training, creating extra overhead for the user in the training process. Typical KAN layers are not designed with the ability to autonomously update their domains in a data-driven manner informed by the changing output ranges of previous layers. As an added benefit, this histogram algorithm may also be applied towards detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs in a variety of settings. We demonstrate that AdaptKAN exceeds or matches the performance of prior KAN architectures and MLPs on four different tasks: learning scientific equations from the Feynman dataset, image classification from frozen features, learning a control Lyapunov function, and detecting OOD inputs on the OpenOOD v1.5 benchmark.
