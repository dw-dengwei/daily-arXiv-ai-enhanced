TL;DR: DreamGym是一个统一的框架，通过基于推理的经验模型合成多样化经验数据，解决RL训练中昂贵的环境交互、任务多样性不足和奖励信号不可靠等问题，显著提升自主代理的在线强化学习训练效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前强化学习在大语言模型代理中的实际应用面临挑战：环境交互成本高、任务多样性有限、奖励信号不可靠、基础设施复杂，这些都阻碍了可扩展经验数据的收集。

Method: DreamGym通过三个关键组件：1) 基于推理的经验模型，通过逐步推理推导一致的状态转移和反馈信号；2) 经验回放缓冲区，用离线真实数据初始化并持续丰富新鲜交互；3) 自适应任务生成，挑战当前代理策略实现有效在线课程学习。

Result: 在多样化环境和代理骨干上的实验表明：在非RL就绪任务如WebArena上，DreamGym比所有基线方法性能提升超过30%；在RL就绪但成本高昂的设置中，仅使用合成交互就能匹配GRPO和PPO性能；在纯合成经验训练的策略转移到真实环境RL时，DreamGym带来显著额外性能提升，同时大幅减少真实世界交互需求。

Conclusion: DreamGym为通用强化学习提供了一个可扩展的热启动策略，通过合成经验数据有效解决了RL训练中的关键瓶颈问题。

Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) can empower large language model (LLM)
agents by enabling self-improvement through interaction, its practical adoption
remains challenging due to costly rollouts, limited task diversity, unreliable
reward signals, and infrastructure complexity, all of which obstruct the
collection of scalable experience data. To address these challenges, we
introduce DreamGym, the first unified framework designed to synthesize diverse
experiences with scalability in mind to enable effective online RL training for
autonomous agents. Rather than relying on expensive real-environment rollouts,
DreamGym distills environment dynamics into a reasoning-based experience model
that derives consistent state transitions and feedback signals through
step-by-step reasoning, enabling scalable agent rollout collection for RL. To
improve the stability and quality of transitions, DreamGym leverages an
experience replay buffer initialized with offline real-world data and
continuously enriched with fresh interactions to actively support agent
training. To improve knowledge acquisition, DreamGym adaptively generates new
tasks that challenge the current agent policy, enabling more effective online
curriculum learning. Experiments across diverse environments and agent
backbones demonstrate that DreamGym substantially improves RL training, both in
fully synthetic settings and in sim-to-real transfer scenarios. On non-RL-ready
tasks like WebArena, DreamGym outperforms all baselines by over 30%. And in
RL-ready but costly settings, it matches GRPO and PPO performance using only
synthetic interactions. When transferring a policy trained purely on synthetic
experiences to real-environment RL, DreamGym yields significant additional
performance gains while requiring far fewer real-world interactions, providing
a scalable warm-start strategy for general-purpose RL.

### [2] [How Different Tokenization Algorithms Impact LLMs and Transformer Models for Binary Code Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03825)
*Ahmed Mostafa,Raisul Arefin Nahid,Samuel Mulder*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 评估NLP分词模型在汇编代码分析中的内在特性，包括词汇量大小、语义覆盖等，并研究其对下游任务（如函数签名预测）的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 汇编代码分词在代码分析中至关重要，但目前研究不足。本研究旨在填补这一空白，探索适合汇编代码特性的分词方法和预处理策略。

Method: 系统研究多种分词模型，通过内在评估比较分词效率、词汇压缩和表示保真度。使用Llama 3.2、BERT和BART等预训练模型评估分词器在多个性能指标上的有效性。

Result: 分词器选择显著影响下游性能，内在指标只能部分预测外在评估结果。研究揭示了内在分词器特性与实际汇编代码任务效用之间的复杂权衡关系。

Conclusion: 本研究为低级代码分析中的分词模型优化提供了宝贵见解，有助于提升基于自然语言模型的二进制分析工作流程的鲁棒性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Tokenization is fundamental in assembly code analysis, impacting intrinsic
characteristics like vocabulary size, semantic coverage, and extrinsic
performance in downstream tasks. Despite its significance, tokenization in the
context of assembly code remains an underexplored area. This study aims to
address this gap by evaluating the intrinsic properties of Natural Language
Processing (NLP) tokenization models and parameter choices, such as vocabulary
size. We explore preprocessing customization options and pre-tokenization rules
tailored to the unique characteristics of assembly code. Additionally, we
assess their impact on downstream tasks like function signature prediction -- a
critical problem in binary code analysis.
  To this end, we conduct a thorough study on various tokenization models,
systematically analyzing their efficiency in encoding assembly instructions and
capturing semantic nuances. Through intrinsic evaluations, we compare
tokenizers based on tokenization efficiency, vocabulary compression, and
representational fidelity for assembly code. Using state-of-the-art pre-trained
models such as the decoder-only Large Language Model (LLM) Llama 3.2, the
encoder-only transformer BERT, and the encoder-decoder model BART, we evaluate
the effectiveness of these tokenizers across multiple performance metrics.
Preliminary findings indicate that tokenizer choice significantly influences
downstream performance, with intrinsic metrics providing partial but incomplete
predictability of extrinsic evaluation outcomes. These results reveal complex
trade-offs between intrinsic tokenizer properties and their utility in
practical assembly code tasks. Ultimately, this study provides valuable
insights into optimizing tokenization models for low-level code analysis,
contributing to the robustness and scalability of Natural Language Model
(NLM)-based binary analysis workflows.

### [3] [To See or To Read: User Behavior Reasoning in Multimodal LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03845)
*Tianning Dong,Luyi Ma,Varun Vasudevan,Jason Cho,Sushant Kumar,Kannan Achan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BehaviorLens框架系统评估了用户行为数据的文本与图像表示对多模态大语言模型性能的影响，发现图像表示能显著提升预测准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索文本和图像表示用户行为数据哪种更有效，以最大化多模态大语言模型在用户行为推理中的性能。

Method: 开发BehaviorLens基准框架，在6个MLLMs上评估三种数据表示方式：文本段落、散点图和流程图，使用真实购买序列数据集。

Result: 当数据表示为图像时，MLLMs的下一次购买预测准确率比等效文本表示提高了87.5%，且无需额外计算成本。

Conclusion: 图像表示用户行为数据比文本表示更有效，能显著提升MLLMs的预测性能。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are reshaping how modern agentic
systems reason over sequential user-behavior data. However, whether textual or
image representations of user behavior data are more effective for maximizing
MLLM performance remains underexplored. We present \texttt{BehaviorLens}, a
systematic benchmarking framework for assessing modality trade-offs in
user-behavior reasoning across six MLLMs by representing transaction data as
(1) a text paragraph, (2) a scatter plot, and (3) a flowchart. Using a
real-world purchase-sequence dataset, we find that when data is represented as
images, MLLMs next-purchase prediction accuracy is improved by 87.5% compared
with an equivalent textual representation without any additional computational
cost.

*Suraj Prasai,Mengnan Du,Ying Zhang,Fan Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: KnowThyself是一个基于聊天的LLM可解释性工具，通过自然语言界面整合现有碎片化工具，降低技术门槛，提供交互式可视化和解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM可解释性工具分散且代码密集，技术门槛高，需要整合为更易用的平台。

Method: 使用编排器LLM重述用户查询，通过代理路由器分配到专门模块，最后将输出整合为连贯解释，嵌入对话工作流中。

Result: 开发了KnowThyself系统，提供聊天界面、模型上传、自然语言提问和交互式可视化功能。

Conclusion: KnowThyself为LLM可解释性提供了可访问且可扩展的平台，降低了技术障碍。

Abstract: We develop KnowThyself, an agentic assistant that advances large language
model (LLM) interpretability. Existing tools provide useful insights but remain
fragmented and code-intensive. KnowThyself consolidates these capabilities into
a chat-based interface, where users can upload models, pose natural language
questions, and obtain interactive visualizations with guided explanations. At
its core, an orchestrator LLM first reformulates user queries, an agent router
further directs them to specialized modules, and the outputs are finally
contextualized into coherent explanations. This design lowers technical
barriers and provides an extensible platform for LLM inspection. By embedding
the whole process into a conversational workflow, KnowThyself offers a robust
foundation for accessible LLM interpretability.

### [5] [Extracting Causal Relations in Deep Knowledge Tracing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03948)
*Kevin Hong,Kia Karbasi,Gregory Pottie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文挑战了深度知识追踪(DKT)模型性能源于双向关系建模的传统观点，证明DKT的真正优势在于其隐式建模先决条件因果关系的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长期以来，计算教育研究的目标是开发可解释的知识追踪模型。DKT被认为是传统KT方法的重大进步，但对其性能来源的解释存在争议。

Method: 通过将练习关系图修剪为有向无环图(DAGs)，并在Assistments数据集的因果子集上训练DKT，分析其预测能力与因果结构的一致性。

Result: 实验表明DKT的预测能力与因果结构高度一致，并提出了基于DKT学习表示提取练习关系DAGs的替代方法。

Conclusion: DKT的有效性主要源于其近似知识组件间因果依赖关系的能力，而非简单的关系映射。

Abstract: A longstanding goal in computational educational research is to develop
explainable knowledge tracing (KT) models. Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT), which
leverages a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to predict student knowledge and
performance on exercises, has been proposed as a major advancement over
traditional KT methods. Several studies suggest that its performance gains stem
from its ability to model bidirectional relationships between different
knowledge components (KCs) within a course, enabling the inference of a
student's understanding of one KC from their performance on others. In this
paper, we challenge this prevailing explanation and demonstrate that DKT's
strength lies in its implicit ability to model prerequisite relationships as a
causal structure, rather than bidirectional relationships. By pruning exercise
relation graphs into Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and training DKT on causal
subsets of the Assistments dataset, we show that DKT's predictive capabilities
align strongly with these causal structures. Furthermore, we propose an
alternative method for extracting exercise relation DAGs using DKT's learned
representations and provide empirical evidence supporting our claim. Our
findings suggest that DKT's effectiveness is largely driven by its capacity to
approximate causal dependencies between KCs rather than simple relational
mappings.

### [6] [LLMs and Cultural Values: the Impact of Prompt Language and Explicit Cultural Framing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03980)
*Bram Bulté,Ayla Rigouts Terryn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs对提示语言和文化框架有响应，但存在系统性偏见，偏向荷兰、德国、美国和日本等少数国家的价值观，无法充分代表文化多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs是否能代表其广泛用户群体的文化多样性，因为训练数据和优化目标存在已知的不平衡问题。

Method: 使用63个来自霍夫斯泰德价值观调查模块和世界价值观调查的项目，翻译成11种语言，以带和不带明确文化视角的提示形式测试10个LLMs。

Result: 提示语言和文化视角都会导致LLM输出变化，但模型存在系统性偏见，偏向特定国家的价值观。文化视角比针对性提示语言更能提高与人类受访者文化价值观的一致性。

Conclusion: LLMs处于一个尴尬的中间地带：对提示变化足够敏感以产生变化，但又过于固守特定文化默认值，无法充分代表文化多样性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly being adopted by users across the
globe, who interact with them in a diverse range of languages. At the same
time, there are well-documented imbalances in the training data and
optimisation objectives of this technology, raising doubts as to whether LLMs
can represent the cultural diversity of their broad user base. In this study,
we look at LLMs and cultural values and examine how prompt language and
cultural framing influence model responses and their alignment with human
values in different countries. We probe 10 LLMs with 63 items from the Hofstede
Values Survey Module and World Values Survey, translated into 11 languages, and
formulated as prompts with and without different explicit cultural
perspectives. Our study confirms that both prompt language and cultural
perspective produce variation in LLM outputs, but with an important caveat:
While targeted prompting can, to a certain extent, steer LLM responses in the
direction of the predominant values of the corresponding countries, it does not
overcome the models' systematic bias toward the values associated with a
restricted set of countries in our dataset: the Netherlands, Germany, the US,
and Japan. All tested models, regardless of their origin, exhibit remarkably
similar patterns: They produce fairly neutral responses on most topics, with
selective progressive stances on issues such as social tolerance. Alignment
with cultural values of human respondents is improved more with an explicit
cultural perspective than with a targeted prompt language. Unexpectedly,
combining both approaches is no more effective than cultural framing with an
English prompt. These findings reveal that LLMs occupy an uncomfortable middle
ground: They are responsive enough to changes in prompts to produce variation,
but too firmly anchored to specific cultural defaults to adequately represent
cultural diversity.

### [7] [ArchPilot: A Proxy-Guided Multi-Agent Approach for Machine Learning Engineering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03985)
*Zhuowen Yuan,Tao Liu,Yang Yang,Yang Wang,Feng Qi,Kaushik Rangadurai,Bo Li,Shuang Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ArchPilot是一个多代理系统，通过集成架构生成、基于代理的评估和自适应搜索来解决LLM代理在自动ML工程中计算开销大、可扩展性差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的代理在自动ML工程中严重依赖重复的完整训练来评估候选方案，导致计算开销大、搜索空间受限和迭代周期慢。

Method: 采用三代理协作框架：编排代理协调MCTS启发式搜索过程，生成代理迭代生成和改进架构，评估代理执行代理训练并生成保真度感知性能指标。

Result: 在MLE-Bench上的实验表明，ArchPilot优于AIDE和ML-Master等最先进基线方法。

Conclusion: ArchPilot通过多代理协作，能够在有限预算下优先考虑高潜力候选方案，实现高效的ML工程。

Abstract: Recent LLM-based agents have demonstrated strong capabilities in automated ML
engineering. However, they heavily rely on repeated full training runs to
evaluate candidate solutions, resulting in significant computational overhead,
limited scalability to large search spaces, and slow iteration cycles. To
address these challenges, we introduce ArchPilot, a multi-agent system that
integrates architecture generation, proxy-based evaluation, and adaptive search
into a unified framework. ArchPilot consists of three specialized agents: an
orchestration agent that coordinates the search process using a Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS)-inspired novel algorithm with a restart mechanism and
manages memory of previous candidates; a generation agent that iteratively
generates, improves, and debugs candidate architectures; and an evaluation
agent that executes proxy training runs, generates and optimizes proxy
functions, and aggregates the proxy scores into a fidelity-aware performance
metric. This multi-agent collaboration allows ArchPilot to prioritize
high-potential candidates with minimal reliance on expensive full training
runs, facilitating efficient ML engineering under limited budgets. Experiments
on MLE-Bench demonstrate that ArchPilot outperforms SOTA baselines such as AIDE
and ML-Master, validating the effectiveness of our multi-agent system.

### [8] [Detecting Silent Failures in Multi-Agentic AI Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04032)
*Divya Pathak,Harshit Kumar,Anuska Roy,Felix George,Mudit Verma,Pratibha Moogi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了多智能体AI系统中的异常检测任务，创建了两个包含4,275和894条轨迹的数据集，展示了监督和半监督方法分别达到98%和96%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体AI系统具有非确定性和易发生静默故障（如漂移、循环、输出细节缺失）的特点，这些故障难以检测。

Method: 开发了数据集构建流程，捕捉用户行为、智能体非确定性和LLM变化，并基于此构建了两个基准数据集。

Result: 在数据集上评估异常检测方法，监督方法（XGBoost）和半监督方法（SVDD）分别达到98%和96%的准确率。

Conclusion: 这是首个系统研究多智能体AI系统异常检测的工作，提供了数据集、基准测试和见解来指导未来研究。

Abstract: Multi-Agentic AI systems, powered by large language models (LLMs), are
inherently non-deterministic and prone to silent failures such as drift,
cycles, and missing details in outputs, which are difficult to detect. We
introduce the task of anomaly detection in agentic trajectories to identify
these failures and present a dataset curation pipeline that captures user
behavior, agent non-determinism, and LLM variation. Using this pipeline, we
curate and label two benchmark datasets comprising \textbf{4,275 and 894}
trajectories from Multi-Agentic AI systems. Benchmarking anomaly detection
methods on these datasets, we show that supervised (XGBoost) and
semi-supervised (SVDD) approaches perform comparably, achieving accuracies up
to 98% and 96%, respectively. This work provides the first systematic study of
anomaly detection in Multi-Agentic AI systems, offering datasets, benchmarks,
and insights to guide future research.

### [9] [Interpreting Multi-Attribute Confounding through Numerical Attributes in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04053)
*Hirohane Takagi,Gouki Minegishi,Shota Kizawa,Issey Sukeda,Hitomi Yanaka*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs在数值推理中存在系统性的错误，研究发现它们会放大真实世界中的数值相关性，且无关的数值上下文会干扰模型的表示和决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管行为研究已记录LLMs在数值推理中的错误，但其底层的表示机制尚不明确。本文旨在探究LLMs如何整合实体的多个数值属性，以及无关数值上下文如何干扰这些表示。

Method: 结合线性探测与偏相关分析，以及基于提示的脆弱性测试，在不同规模的模型上进行实验。

Result: LLMs编码了真实世界的数值相关性但会系统性地放大它们；无关上下文会引起数值表示的一致偏移，且下游影响因模型规模而异。

Conclusion: 这些发现揭示了LLM决策中的一个脆弱性，为在多属性纠缠下实现更公平、表示感知的控制奠定了基础。

Abstract: Although behavioral studies have documented numerical reasoning errors in
large language models (LLMs), the underlying representational mechanisms remain
unclear. We hypothesize that numerical attributes occupy shared latent
subspaces and investigate two questions:(1) How do LLMs internally integrate
multiple numerical attributes of a single entity? (2)How does irrelevant
numerical context perturb these representations and their downstream outputs?
To address these questions, we combine linear probing with partial correlation
analysis and prompt-based vulnerability tests across models of varying sizes.
Our results show that LLMs encode real-world numerical correlations but tend to
systematically amplify them. Moreover, irrelevant context induces consistent
shifts in magnitude representations, with downstream effects that vary by model
size. These findings reveal a vulnerability in LLM decision-making and lay the
groundwork for fairer, representation-aware control under multi-attribute
entanglement.

### [10] [Agentmandering: A Game-Theoretic Framework for Fair Redistricting via Large Language Model Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04076)
*Hao Li,Haotian Chen,Ruoyuan Gong,Juanjuan Wang,Hao Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为Agentmandering的框架，将选区重划重新构想为两个代表对立政治利益的智能体之间的回合制谈判，通过嵌入战略互动来减少党派偏见和不公平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的选区重划计算方法主要关注生成大量法律上有效的选区划分方案，但忽视了选择过程中的战略动态，这为党派行为者挑选政治上有利的地图创造了机会。

Method: 基于博弈论思想，特别是"选择并冻结"协议，使用大型语言模型智能体进行回合制谈判，智能体从少量候选地图中交替选择和冻结选区，通过受约束且可解释的选择逐步划分州。

Result: 在2020年美国人口普查数据上的评估显示，Agentmandering显著减少了党派偏见和不公平，同时实现了比标准基线低2到3个数量级的方差。

Conclusion: 该方法在摇摆州场景中表现出公平性和稳定性，为选区重划过程提供了更公平和稳定的解决方案。

Abstract: Redistricting plays a central role in shaping how votes are translated into
political power. While existing computational methods primarily aim to generate
large ensembles of legally valid districting plans, they often neglect the
strategic dynamics involved in the selection process. This oversight creates
opportunities for partisan actors to cherry-pick maps that, while technically
compliant, are politically advantageous. Simply satisfying formal constraints
does not ensure fairness when the selection process itself can be manipulated.
We propose \textbf{Agentmandering}, a framework that reimagines redistricting
as a turn-based negotiation between two agents representing opposing political
interests. Drawing inspiration from game-theoretic ideas, particularly the
\textit{Choose-and-Freeze} protocol, our method embeds strategic interaction
into the redistricting process via large language model (LLM) agents. Agents
alternate between selecting and freezing districts from a small set of
candidate maps, gradually partitioning the state through constrained and
interpretable choices. Evaluation on post-2020 U.S. Census data across all
states shows that Agentmandering significantly reduces partisan bias and
unfairness, while achieving 2 to 3 orders of magnitude lower variance than
standard baselines. These results demonstrate both fairness and stability,
especially in swing-state scenarios. Our code is available at
https://github.com/Lihaogx/AgentMandering.

### [11] [KGFR: A Foundation Retriever for Generalized Knowledge Graph Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04093)
*Yuanning Cui,Zequn Sun,Wei Hu,Zhangjie Fu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM-KGFR框架通过结合大语言模型和知识图谱基础检索器，解决LLM在知识密集型问题上的局限性，实现零样本泛化和高效处理大规模图谱。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖微调LLM或GNN检索器，存在数据集特定调整和在大规模或未见图谱上扩展性不足的问题。

Method: 使用LLM生成关系描述编码，基于问题角色初始化实体，采用非对称渐进传播进行高效扩展，通过节点、边和路径级接口形成可控推理循环。

Result: 实验表明LLM-KGFR在保持可扩展性和泛化性的同时实现强性能。

Conclusion: 该框架为知识图谱增强推理提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at reasoning but struggle with
knowledge-intensive questions due to limited context and parametric knowledge.
However, existing methods that rely on finetuned LLMs or GNN retrievers are
limited by dataset-specific tuning and scalability on large or unseen graphs.
We propose the LLM-KGFR collaborative framework, where an LLM works with a
structured retriever, the Knowledge Graph Foundation Retriever (KGFR). KGFR
encodes relations using LLM-generated descriptions and initializes entities
based on their roles in the question, enabling zero-shot generalization to
unseen KGs. To handle large graphs efficiently, it employs Asymmetric
Progressive Propagation (APP)- a stepwise expansion that selectively limits
high-degree nodes while retaining informative paths. Through node-, edge-, and
path-level interfaces, the LLM iteratively requests candidate answers,
supporting facts, and reasoning paths, forming a controllable reasoning loop.
Experiments demonstrate that LLM-KGFR achieves strong performance while
maintaining scalability and generalization, providing a practical solution for
KG-augmented reasoning.

*Miguel E. Andres,Vadim Fedorov,Rida Sadek,Enric Spagnolo-Arrizabalaga,Nadescha Trudel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了首个系统化框架来评估语音AI测试质量，通过人类中心化基准测试解决测试平台的双重挑战：生成真实测试对话和准确评估代理响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语音AI代理快速部署到生产环境，缺乏系统化方法来确保测试可靠性，组织无法客观评估测试方法是否有效，在语音AI扩展到数十亿日常交互时产生了关键的测量差距。

Method: 结合成熟的心理测量技术（成对比较产生Elo评分、bootstrap置信区间和置换检验）与严格的统计验证，提供可复现的度量标准，适用于任何测试方法。

Result: 对三个领先商业平台进行了全面实证评估，使用21,600个人类判断，结果显示性能存在统计显著差异，表现最佳的平台Evalion在评估质量上达到0.92 F1分数，模拟质量达到0.61。

Conclusion: 该框架使研究人员和组织能够经验性地验证任何平台的测试能力，为大规模语音AI部署提供必要的测量基础。

Abstract: Voice AI agents are rapidly transitioning to production deployments, yet
systematic methods for ensuring testing reliability remain underdeveloped.
Organizations cannot objectively assess whether their testing approaches
(internal tools or external platforms) actually work, creating a critical
measurement gap as voice AI scales to billions of daily interactions.
  We present the first systematic framework for evaluating voice AI testing
quality through human-centered benchmarking. Our methodology addresses the
fundamental dual challenge of testing platforms: generating realistic test
conversations (simulation quality) and accurately evaluating agent responses
(evaluation quality). The framework combines established psychometric
techniques (pairwise comparisons yielding Elo ratings, bootstrap confidence
intervals, and permutation tests) with rigorous statistical validation to
provide reproducible metrics applicable to any testing approach.
  To validate the framework and demonstrate its utility, we conducted
comprehensive empirical evaluation of three leading commercial platforms
focused on Voice AI Testing using 21,600 human judgments across 45 simulations
and ground truth validation on 60 conversations. Results reveal statistically
significant performance differences with the proposed framework, with the
top-performing platform, Evalion, achieving 0.92 evaluation quality measured as
f1-score versus 0.73 for others, and 0.61 simulation quality using a league
based scoring system (including ties) vs 0.43 for other platforms.
  This framework enables researchers and organizations to empirically validate
the testing capabilities of any platform, providing essential measurement
foundations for confident voice AI deployment at scale. Supporting materials
are made available to facilitate reproducibility and adoption.

### [13] [When Empowerment Disempowers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04177)
*Claire Yang,Maya Cakmak,Max Kleiman-Weiner*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文研究了在多人类环境中，基于赋权（empowerment）的AI辅助行为可能导致对其他人类的环境影响和奖励减少的现象，称为"去赋权"（disempowerment）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 赋权作为AI代理的通用目标无关目标，在单人类环境中已被证明有效，但在多人类环境（如家庭、医院）中，为一个人优化的赋权目标可能会损害其他人的利益。

Method: 开发了开源的多人类网格世界测试套件Disempower-Grid，通过实验研究辅助RL代理在不同情境下的行为，并分析联合赋权作为缓解策略。

Result: 实验表明，优化单人类赋权的辅助代理会显著减少其他人类的环境影响和奖励；联合赋权可以缓解去赋权现象，但会以用户奖励为代价。

Conclusion: 在单智能体环境中看似对齐的目标无关目标，在多智能体环境中可能变得不对齐，这对AI对齐社区提出了更广泛的挑战。

Abstract: Empowerment, a measure of an agent's ability to control its environment, has
been proposed as a universal goal-agnostic objective for motivating assistive
behavior in AI agents. While multi-human settings like homes and hospitals are
promising for AI assistance, prior work on empowerment-based assistance assumes
that the agent assists one human in isolation. We introduce an open source
multi-human gridworld test suite Disempower-Grid. Using Disempower-Grid, we
empirically show that assistive RL agents optimizing for one human's
empowerment can significantly reduce another human's environmental influence
and rewards - a phenomenon we formalize as disempowerment. We characterize when
disempowerment occurs in these environments and show that joint empowerment
mitigates disempowerment at the cost of the user's reward. Our work reveals a
broader challenge for the AI alignment community: goal-agnostic objectives that
seem aligned in single-agent settings can become misaligned in multi-agent
contexts.

*Alan Seroul,Théo Fagnoni,Inès Adnani,Dana O. Mohamed,Phillip Kingston*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Opus工作流评估框架：一个概率-规范化的数学框架，用于量化工作流质量和效率，结合正确性、可靠性和成本，支持工作流的比较、评分和优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要一种系统化的方法来评估和优化工作流的质量和效率，特别是在现代自动化系统中，传统方法难以量化工作流的性能指标。

Method: 结合Opus工作流奖励（概率函数估计预期性能）和Opus工作流规范惩罚（测量结构性和信息质量），形成一个统一的数学模型。

Result: 提出了一个支持自动化工作流评估、排名和优化的框架，可集成到强化学习循环中指导工作流发现和优化。

Conclusion: 该框架为工作流质量评估提供了数学基础，能够直接比较和优化工作流，在现代自动化系统中具有实用价值。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Opus Workflow Evaluation Framework, a
probabilistic-normative formulation for quantifying Workflow quality and
efficiency. It integrates notions of correctness, reliability, and cost into a
coherent mathematical model that enables direct comparison, scoring, and
optimization of Workflows. The framework combines the Opus Workflow Reward, a
probabilistic function estimating expected performance through success
likelihood, resource usage, and output gain, with the Opus Workflow Normative
Penalties, a set of measurable functions capturing structural and informational
quality across Cohesion, Coupling, Observability, and Information Hygiene. It
supports automated Workflow assessment, ranking, and optimization within modern
automation systems such as Opus and can be integrated into Reinforcement
Learning loops to guide Workflow discovery and refinement. In this paper, we
introduce the Opus Workflow Reward model that formalizes Workflow success as a

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个多智能体预测编码框架，通过最小化智能体间的相互不确定性来解决协调问题，在带宽受限条件下表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多智能体系统中由于部分可观测性和有限带宽导致的空间记忆共享和协调失败问题。

Method: 使用信息瓶颈目标，让智能体学习何时、与谁、以及通信什么内容；基于网格细胞状的空间编码，发展出带宽高效的通信机制和类似海马体社会位置细胞的神经群体；采用分层强化学习策略主动探索以减少联合不确定性。

Result: 在Memory-Maze基准测试中，当带宽从128位/步缩减到4位/步时，成功率从73.5%优雅下降到64.4%，而全广播基线从67.6%崩溃到28.6%。

Conclusion: 建立了一个理论上严谨且生物学合理的框架，展示了复杂社会表征如何从统一的预测驱动中涌现，从而实现社会集体智能。

Abstract: Sharing and reconstructing a consistent spatial memory is a critical
challenge in multi-agent systems, where partial observability and limited
bandwidth often lead to catastrophic failures in coordination. We introduce a
multi-agent predictive coding framework that formulate coordination as the
minimization of mutual uncertainty among agents. Instantiated as an information
bottleneck objective, it prompts agents to learn not only who and what to
communicate but also when. At the foundation of this framework lies a
grid-cell-like metric as internal spatial coding for self-localization,
emerging spontaneously from self-supervised motion prediction. Building upon
this internal spatial code, agents gradually develop a bandwidth-efficient
communication mechanism and specialized neural populations that encode
partners' locations: an artificial analogue of hippocampal social place cells
(SPCs). These social representations are further enacted by a hierarchical
reinforcement learning policy that actively explores to reduce joint
uncertainty. On the Memory-Maze benchmark, our approach shows exceptional
resilience to bandwidth constraints: success degrades gracefully from 73.5% to
64.4% as bandwidth shrinks from 128 to 4 bits/step, whereas a full-broadcast
baseline collapses from 67.6% to 28.6%. Our findings establish a theoretically
principled and biologically plausible basis for how complex social
representations emerge from a unified predictive drive, leading to social
collective intelligence.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RLoop是一个自改进框架，通过迭代策略初始化解决RL训练中的过拟合问题，将训练过程转化为探索和利用的良性循环，显著提升泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习在训练大型推理模型时存在过拟合问题，模型获得训练奖励但失去泛化能力，这由策略过专业化和灾难性遗忘引起。

Method: RLoop框架包含迭代策略初始化：先用RL从给定策略探索解空间，然后过滤成功轨迹创建专家数据集，通过拒绝采样微调(RFT)来优化初始策略，为下一轮迭代提供更好的起点。

Result: RLoop显著缓解遗忘问题并大幅提升泛化能力，相比原始RL方法，平均准确率提升9%，pass@32提升超过15%。

Conclusion: RLoop通过将瞬态策略变化转化为稳健性能增益，有效解决了RL训练中的过拟合和泛化问题。

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning for Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is powerful for
training large reasoning models, its training dynamics harbor a critical
challenge: RL overfitting, where models gain training rewards but lose
generalization. Our analysis reveals this is driven by policy
over-specialization and catastrophic forgetting of diverse solutions generated
during training. Standard optimization discards this valuable inter-step policy
diversity. To address this, we introduce RLoop, a self-improving framework
built on iterative policy initialization. RLoop transforms the standard
training process into a virtuous cycle: it first uses RL to explore the
solution space from a given policy, then filters the successful trajectories to
create an expert dataset. This dataset is used via Rejection-sampling
Fine-Tuning (RFT) to refine the initial policy, creating a superior starting
point for the next iteration. This loop of exploration and exploitation via
iterative re-initialization effectively converts transient policy variations
into robust performance gains. Our experiments show RLoop mitigates forgetting
and substantially improves generalization, boosting average accuracy by 9% and
pass@32 by over 15% compared to vanilla RL.

TL;DR: GUI-360°是一个大规模数据集和基准套件，用于推进计算机使用代理(CUAs)的研究，包含120万+执行动作步骤，支持GUI定位、屏幕解析和动作预测三个核心任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决计算机使用代理研究中的三个关键缺口：真实世界CUA任务稀缺、多模态轨迹自动收集标注流程缺乏、以及缺乏统一评估GUI定位、屏幕解析和动作预测的基准。

Method: 采用LLM增强的自动化流程，包括查询来源、环境模板构建、任务实例化、批量执行和LLM驱动的质量过滤，在Windows办公应用中收集数千条轨迹。

Result: 基准测试显示现有视觉-语言模型在定位和动作预测方面存在显著不足，监督微调和强化学习虽有改进但未达到人类可靠性水平。

Conclusion: GUI-360°为可重复研究和稳健桌面CUAs的进展提供了重要资源，数据集和代码已公开发布。

Abstract: We introduce GUI-360$^\circ$, a large-scale, comprehensive dataset and
benchmark suite designed to advance computer-using agents (CUAs). CUAs present
unique challenges and is constrained by three persistent gaps: a scarcity of
real-world CUA tasks, the lack of automated collection-and-annotation pipelines
for multi-modal trajectories, and the absence of a unified benchmark that
jointly evaluates GUI grounding, screen parsing, and action prediction.
  GUI-360$^\circ$ addresses these gaps with an LLM-augmented, largely automated
pipeline for query sourcing, environment-template construction, task
instantiation, batched execution, and LLM-driven quality filtering. The
released corpus contains over 1.2M executed action steps across thousands of
trajectories in popular Windows office applications, and includes
full-resolution screenshots, accessibility metadata when available,
instantiated goals, intermediate reasoning traces, and both successful and
failed action trajectories. The dataset supports three canonical tasks, GUI
grounding, screen parsing, and action prediction, and a hybrid GUI+API action
space that reflects modern agent designs. Benchmarking state-of-the-art
vision--language models on GUI-360$^\circ$ reveals substantial out-of-the-box
shortcomings in grounding and action prediction; supervised fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning yield significant gains but do not close the gap to
human-level reliability. We release GUI-360$^\circ$ and accompanying code to
facilitate reproducible research and accelerate progress on robust desktop
CUAs.

TL;DR: 本文指出概念激活向量(CAV)的线性分类器探针准确率不能可靠反映概念对齐度，探针更可能捕捉虚假相关性而非目标概念。作者提出基于空间线性归因的新概念定位方法，并引入三类概念对齐评估指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前可解释AI中广泛假设高探针准确率意味着CAV能忠实表示目标概念，但作者发现这种假设不可靠，探针容易捕捉虚假相关性而非真正概念。

Method: 提出基于空间线性归因的概念定位方法，与现有特征可视化技术进行对比，并引入三类评估指标：硬准确率、分割分数和增强鲁棒性。

Result: 研究表明，具有平移不变性和空间对齐的探针能持续提高概念对齐度。故意构建的错位探针利用虚假相关性也能达到接近标准探针的准确率。

Conclusion: 需要基于对齐度的评估指标而非探针准确率，探针设计应考虑模型架构和目标概念性质，平移不变性和空间对齐能提升概念对齐效果。

Abstract: In explainable AI, Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) are typically obtained
by training linear classifier probes to detect human-understandable concepts as
directions in the activation space of deep neural networks. It is widely
assumed that a high probe accuracy indicates a CAV faithfully representing its
target concept. However, we show that the probe's classification accuracy alone
is an unreliable measure of concept alignment, i.e., the degree to which a CAV
captures the intended concept. In fact, we argue that probes are more likely to
capture spurious correlations than they are to represent only the intended
concept. As part of our analysis, we demonstrate that deliberately misaligned
probes constructed to exploit spurious correlations, achieve an accuracy close
to that of standard probes. To address this severe problem, we introduce a
novel concept localization method based on spatial linear attribution, and
provide a comprehensive comparison of it to existing feature visualization
techniques for detecting and mitigating concept misalignment. We further
propose three classes of metrics for quantitatively assessing concept
alignment: hard accuracy, segmentation scores, and augmentation robustness. Our
analysis shows that probes with translation invariance and spatial alignment
consistently increase concept alignment. These findings highlight the need for
alignment-based evaluation metrics rather than probe accuracy, and the
importance of tailoring probes to both the model architecture and the nature of
the target concept.

Conclusion: AdversariaLLM为LLM安全研究提供了一个强大的基础，解决了当前研究生态系统的碎片化问题，促进了该领域的透明、可比较和可复现研究。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of research on Large Language Model (LLM) safety and
robustness has produced a fragmented and oftentimes buggy ecosystem of
implementations, datasets, and evaluation methods. This fragmentation makes
reproducibility and comparability across studies challenging, hindering
meaningful progress. To address these issues, we introduce AdversariaLLM, a
toolbox for conducting LLM jailbreak robustness research. Its design centers on
reproducibility, correctness, and extensibility. The framework implements
twelve adversarial attack algorithms, integrates seven benchmark datasets
spanning harmfulness, over-refusal, and utility evaluation, and provides access
to a wide range of open-weight LLMs via Hugging Face. The implementation
includes advanced features for comparability and reproducibility such as
compute-resource tracking, deterministic results, and distributional evaluation
techniques. \name also integrates judging through the companion package
JudgeZoo, which can also be used independently. Together, these components aim
to establish a robust foundation for transparent, comparable, and reproducible
research in LLM safety.

TL;DR: 提出了RxSafeBench框架，通过模拟临床咨询来评估LLMs的药物安全性能力，包含6,725种禁忌症、28,781种药物相互作用和14,906种适应症-药物对，构建了2,443个高质量咨询场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于LLMs的医疗系统在药物安全性方面的研究有限，缺乏真实世界数据集，且在真实临床咨询环境中的评估不足。

Method: 开发了模拟临床咨询的框架，生成包含药物风险的诊断对话，采用两阶段过滤策略确保临床真实性和专业质量，使用结构化多选题评估LLMs推荐安全药物的能力。

Result: 当前LLMs在整合禁忌症和相互作用知识方面存在困难，特别是当风险是隐含而非明确时表现不佳。

Conclusion: RxSafeBench提供了首个评估LLMs药物安全性的综合基准，为改进AI驱动的临床决策支持系统的可靠性提供了见解。

Abstract: Numerous medical systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have
achieved remarkable progress in diverse healthcare tasks. However, research on
their medication safety remains limited due to the lack of real world datasets,
constrained by privacy and accessibility issues. Moreover, evaluation of LLMs
in realistic clinical consultation settings, particularly regarding medication
safety, is still underexplored. To address these gaps, we propose a framework
that simulates and evaluates clinical consultations to systematically assess
the medication safety capabilities of LLMs. Within this framework, we generate
inquiry diagnosis dialogues with embedded medication risks and construct a
dedicated medication safety database, RxRisk DB, containing 6,725
contraindications, 28,781 drug interactions, and 14,906 indication-drug pairs.
A two-stage filtering strategy ensures clinical realism and professional
quality, resulting in the benchmark RxSafeBench with 2,443 high-quality
consultation scenarios. We evaluate leading open-source and proprietary LLMs
using structured multiple choice questions that test their ability to recommend
safe medications under simulated patient contexts. Results show that current
LLMs struggle to integrate contraindication and interaction knowledge,
especially when risks are implied rather than explicit. Our findings highlight
key challenges in ensuring medication safety in LLM-based systems and provide
insights into improving reliability through better prompting and task-specific
tuning. RxSafeBench offers the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
medication safety in LLMs, advancing safer and more trustworthy AI-driven
clinical decision support.

*Nick Oh,Fernand Gobet*

TL;DR: 该论文提出了Monitor-Generate-Verify (MGV)框架，通过在Generate-Verify范式前添加显式监控过程来解决模型早期承诺次优推理路径的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的测试时推理架构缺乏监控过程，导致模型陷入前缀支配陷阱，即过早承诺次优推理路径且难以恢复，造成约20%的准确率损失。

Method: 将Flavell以及Nelson和Narens的元认知理论形式化为计算规范，提出MGV框架，在生成开始前添加显式监控来捕获元认知体验，并通过验证反馈改进未来监控。

Result: 虽然未提供实证验证，但这是首次系统地将基础元认知理论转化为计算规范，为理解推理系统失败提供了原则性词汇。

Conclusion: MGV框架为解决测试时推理架构中的监控缺失问题提供了理论基础，并为未来设计指明了具体的架构干预方向。

Abstract: Test-time reasoning architectures such as those following the Generate-Verify
paradigm -- where a model iteratively refines or verifies its own generated
outputs -- prioritise generation and verification but exclude the monitoring
processes that determine when and how reasoning should begin. This omission may
contribute to the prefix dominance trap, in which models commit early to
suboptimal reasoning paths and seldom recover, yielding roughly 20% accuracy
loss. We address this architectural gap by formalising Flavell's and Nelson and
Narens' metacognitive theories into computational specifications, proposing the
Monitor-Generate-Verify (MGV) framework. MGV extends the Generate-Verify
paradigm by adding explicit monitoring that captures metacognitive experiences
(from difficulty assessments to confidence judgements) before generation begins
and refines future monitoring through verification feedback. Though we present
no empirical validation, this work provides the first systematic computational
translation of foundational metacognitive theories, offering a principled
vocabulary for understanding reasoning system failures and suggesting specific
architectural interventions for future test-time reasoning designs.

*Chanwoo Park,Ziyang Chen,Asuman Ozdaglar,Kaiqing Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Iterative RMFT方法，通过迭代蒸馏低后悔决策轨迹来增强LLMs的决策能力，无需依赖已知算法或人工模板。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在交互动态环境中作为决策代理时表现不佳，难以实现低后悔或有效的探索-利用权衡。

Method: 迭代后悔最小化微调：模型多次生成决策轨迹，选择k个最低后悔轨迹进行自我微调，利用后悔度量激发模型自身的决策能力和推理逻辑。

Result: Iterative RMFT显著提升了多种LLMs的决策性能，包括Transformer、开源LLMs和GPT-4o mini等闭源模型，在多样化任务中展现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: Iterative RMFT提供了一个原则性且通用的后训练框架，可有效增强LLMs的决策能力，理论分析表明在简化设置下单层Transformer可实现无后悔学习。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as "agents" for
decision-making (DM) in interactive and dynamic environments. Yet, since they
were not originally designed for DM, recent studies show that LLMs can struggle
even in basic online DM problems, failing to achieve low regret or an effective
exploration-exploitation tradeoff. To address this, we introduce Iterative
Regret-Minimization Fine-Tuning (Iterative RMFT), a post-training procedure
that repeatedly distills low-regret decision trajectories back into the base
model. At each iteration, the model rolls out multiple decision trajectories,
selects the k-lowest regret ones, and fine-tunes itself on them. Unlike prior
methods that (a) distill action sequences from known DM algorithms or (b) rely
on manually crafted chain-of-thought templates, our approach leverages the
regret metric to elicit the model's own DM ability and reasoning rationales.
This reliance on model-generated reasoning avoids rigid output engineering and
provides more flexible, natural-language training signals. Empirical results
show that Iterative RMFT improves LLMs' DM performance across diverse models -
from Transformers with numerical input/output, to open-weight LLMs, and
advanced closed-weight models like GPT-4o mini. Its flexibility in output and
reasoning formats enables generalization across tasks with varying horizons,
action spaces, reward processes, and natural-language contexts. Finally, we
provide theoretical insight showing that a single-layer Transformer under this
paradigm can act as a no-regret learner in a simplified setting. Overall,
Iterative RMFT offers a principled and general post-training framework for
enhancing LLMs' decision-making capabilities.

*Anisha Garg,Ganesh Venkatesh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CoRPO是一种改进的强化学习方法，解决了GRPO在使用序数奖励时对失败轨迹进行错误强化的问题，通过自适应基线确保失败解决方案不被正向强化，并在达到质量阈值后转向相对偏好模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO的简单性使其在适应LLM特定任务时很受欢迎，但在使用序数奖励提供部分信用时存在问题，其组平均基线经常对失败轨迹分配正优势并强化错误行为。

Method: CoRPO使用自适应基线强制执行最低质量阈值，确保失败解决方案永远不会被正向强化。一旦策略持续满足此阈值，基线自动转换为相对偏好模式，推动模型寻找最优解决方案而非仅可接受的方案。

Result: 在代码验证任务上的实证验证显示，CoRPO表现出更稳定的收敛性和更好的域外泛化能力。

Conclusion: 这项工作是在LLM通过强化学习获得真正新能力的研究计划中的关键一步，通过从二元奖励扩展到序数奖励，为更密集的逐步监督铺平了道路。

Abstract: Group-relative Policy Optimization's (GRPO) simplicity makes it highly
desirable for adapting LLMs to become experts at specific tasks. But this
simplicity also makes it ill-specified as we seek to enhance RL training with
richer, non-binary feedback. When using ordinal rewards to give partial credit,
GRPO's simplicity starts to hurt, as its group-average baseline often assigns a
positive advantage to failed trajectories and reinforces incorrect behavior.
  We introduce Correctness Relative Policy Optimization (CoRPO), a new
formulation that solves this flaw. CoRPO uses an adaptive baseline that
enforces a minimum quality threshold, ensuring failed solutions are never
positively reinforced. Once the policy consistently meets this threshold, the
baseline automatically transitions to a relative preference mode, pushing the
model to find optimal solutions rather than just "acceptable" ones. We
empirically validate CoRPO on a code verification task, where it demonstrates
more stable convergence and better out-of-domain generalization.
  This work represents a critical step in our broader research program to
enable LLMs to learn genuinely new capabilities through reinforcement learning.
We achieve this by enabling LLMs to learn from rich, multi-dimensional feedback
- progressing from binary to ordinal rewards in this work, and onward to
denser, per-step supervision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统车辆路径系统只能优化单一指标（如时间或距离），无法理解人类驾驶员的复杂语义和动态上下文（如多步骤任务、情境约束、紧急需求），需要能够集成语义推理的智能路径规划系统。

Method: 使用多目标（时间、CO2）Dijkstra算法生成候选路线集，然后通过LLM代理结合预处理的POI地理空间缓存，评估路线是否符合用户任务、偏好和规避规则。

Result: 在真实城市场景测试中，PAVe成功将复杂用户意图转化为适当的路线修改，使用本地模型时初始路线选择准确率超过88%。

Conclusion: 将经典路由算法与基于LLM的语义推理层相结合，是创建个性化、自适应和可扩展城市移动优化解决方案的稳健有效方法。

Abstract: Traditional vehicle routing systems efficiently optimize singular metrics
like time or distance, and when considering multiple metrics, they need more
processes to optimize . However, they lack the capability to interpret and
integrate the complex, semantic, and dynamic contexts of human drivers, such as
multi-step tasks, situational constraints, or urgent needs. This paper
introduces and evaluates PAVe (Personalized Agentic Vehicular Routing), a
hybrid agentic assistant designed to augment classical pathfinding algorithms
with contextual reasoning. Our approach employs a Large Language Model (LLM)
agent that operates on a candidate set of routes generated by a multi-objective
(time, CO2) Dijkstra algorithm. The agent evaluates these options against
user-provided tasks, preferences, and avoidance rules by leveraging a
pre-processed geospatial cache of urban Points of Interest (POIs). In a
benchmark of realistic urban scenarios, PAVe successfully used complex user
intent into appropriate route modifications, achieving over 88% accuracy in its
initial route selections with a local model. We conclude that combining
classical routing algorithms with an LLM-based semantic reasoning layer is a
robust and effective approach for creating personalized, adaptive, and scalable
solutions for urban mobility optimization.

Motivation: 尽管网络代理研究蓬勃发展，但其引发的可持续性问题仍未被充分探索。作者旨在揭示网络代理的能源和碳排放成本，以强调该问题的紧迫性。

Method: 从理论和实证两个角度进行研究：理论方面通过估算，实证方面通过基准测试来评估网络代理的能源消耗。

Result: 研究发现不同网络代理设计理念会严重影响能耗，且高能耗不一定对应更好结果。同时指出某些网络代理缺乏模型参数和流程透明度，限制了能耗估算。

Conclusion: 需要改变评估网络代理的方式，在基准测试中加入专门的能耗测量指标，以促进更可持续的网络代理发展。

Abstract: Web agents, like OpenAI's Operator and Google's Project Mariner, are powerful
agentic systems pushing the boundaries of Large Language Models (LLM). They can
autonomously interact with the internet at the user's behest, such as
navigating websites, filling search masks, and comparing price lists. Though
web agent research is thriving, induced sustainability issues remain largely
unexplored. To highlight the urgency of this issue, we provide an initial
exploration of the energy and $CO_2$ cost associated with web agents from both
a theoretical -via estimation- and an empirical perspective -by benchmarking.
Our results show how different philosophies in web agent creation can severely
impact the associated expended energy, and that more energy consumed does not
necessarily equate to better results. We highlight a lack of transparency
regarding disclosing model parameters and processes used for some web agents as
a limiting factor when estimating energy consumption. Our work contributes
towards a change in thinking of how we evaluate web agents, advocating for
dedicated metrics measuring energy consumption in benchmarks.

Motivation: 理解LLMs与人类决策的相似度至关重要，因为不匹配可能导致实际应用中的有害结果，而无法复制人类行为会使LLMs在社会模拟中无效。

Method: 开发博弈论实验的数字孪生，引入系统提示和探测框架进行机器行为评估，测试三个开源模型（Llama、Mistral和Qwen）。

Result: Llama能高保真复制人类合作模式，捕捉人类偏离理性选择理论的行为；Qwen与纳什均衡预测高度一致；无需基于角色的提示即可实现群体级行为复制。

Conclusion: 适当校准的LLMs可以复制人类行为模式，为社会科学研究提供补充方法，生成关于人类社交决策的新实证预测。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used both to make decisions in
domains such as health, education and law, and to simulate human behavior. Yet
how closely LLMs mirror actual human decision-making remains poorly understood.
This gap is critical: misalignment could produce harmful outcomes in practical
applications, while failure to replicate human behavior renders LLMs
ineffective for social simulations. Here, we address this gap by developing a
digital twin of game-theoretic experiments and introducing a systematic
prompting and probing framework for machine-behavioral evaluation. Testing
three open-source models (Llama, Mistral and Qwen), we find that Llama
reproduces human cooperation patterns with high fidelity, capturing human
deviations from rational choice theory, while Qwen aligns closely with Nash
equilibrium predictions. Notably, we achieved population-level behavioral
replication without persona-based prompting, simplifying the simulation
process. Extending beyond the original human-tested games, we generate and
preregister testable hypotheses for novel game configurations outside the
original parameter grid. Our findings demonstrate that appropriately calibrated
LLMs can replicate aggregate human behavioral patterns and enable systematic
exploration of unexplored experimental spaces, offering a complementary
approach to traditional research in the social and behavioral sciences that
generates new empirical predictions about human social decision-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市地表水洪水日益频繁，但高时空分辨率的洪水预测和监测受到时间、预算和技术限制，如何在资源受限条件下监测城市排水网络和预测流量状况是一个主要挑战。

Method: 使用SWMM模型生成峰值流量训练数据集，应用数据驱动稀疏传感框架，通过奇异值分解降维和QR分解进行传感器分配，识别最优监测节点。

Result: 在77个节点中仅需3个优化布置的传感器，即可实现满意的重建性能（NSE值0.92-0.95），模型对测量不确定性具有良好的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该框架平衡了计算效率和物理可解释性，能够以最少的传感器实现高精度流量重建，可进一步与预测模型集成，在有限传感资源下实现洪水预警和实时控制。

Abstract: Urban surface water flooding, triggered by intense rainfall overwhelming
drainage systems, is increasingly frequent and widespread. While flood
prediction and monitoring in high spatial-temporal resolution are desired,
practical constraints in time, budget, and technology hinder its full
implementation. How to monitor urban drainage networks and predict flow
conditions under constrained resource is a major challenge. This study presents
a data-driven sparse sensing (DSS) framework, integrated with EPA-SWMM, to
optimize sensor placement and reconstruct peak flowrates in a stormwater
system, using the Woodland Avenue catchment in Duluth, Minnesota, as a case
study. We utilized a SWMM model to generate a training dataset of peak flowrate
profiles across the stormwater network. Furthermore, we applied DSS -
leveraging singular value decomposition for dimensionality reduction and QR
factorization for sensor allocation - to identify the optimal monitoring nodes
based on the simulated training dataset. We then validated the
representativeness of these identified monitoring nodes by comparing the
DSS-reconstructed peak flowrate profiles with those obtained from SWMM. Three
optimally placed sensors among 77 nodes achieved satisfactory reconstruction
performance with Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) values of 0.92-0.95 (25th to
75th percentiles). In addition, the model showed good robustness to uncertainty
in measurements. Its robustness to sensor failures is location-dependent and
improves with the number of sensors deployed. The framework balances
computational efficiency and physical interpretability, enabling high-accuracy
flow reconstruction with minimal sensors. This DSS framework can be further
integrated with predictive models to realize flood early warning and real-time
control under limited sensing and monitoring resource.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 开发了Jr. AI Scientist系统，这是一个模拟学生研究流程的自主AI科学家系统，能够分析论文局限性、提出假设、实验验证并撰写论文，在评估中表现优于现有全自动系统，但仍有重要局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解当前AI科学家系统的能力和风险对于确保可信赖和可持续的AI驱动科学进步至关重要，同时需要维护学术生态系统的完整性。

Method: 开发Jr. AI Scientist系统，模拟新手学生研究者的核心研究流程：分析基线论文局限性、制定改进假设、通过严格实验验证、撰写结果论文。利用现代编码代理处理复杂的多文件实现。

Result: 通过AI评审员自动评估、作者主导评估和向Agents4Science投稿进行评估。结果显示Jr. AI Scientist生成的论文评分高于现有全自动系统，但作者评估和Agents4Science评审都发现了重要局限性。

Conclusion: 当前AI科学家系统存在直接应用的风险和关键挑战，需要进一步研究。报告了开发过程中识别的各种风险，希望加深对AI科学家发展现状和风险的理解。

Abstract: Understanding the current capabilities and risks of AI Scientist systems is
essential for ensuring trustworthy and sustainable AI-driven scientific
progress while preserving the integrity of the academic ecosystem. To this end,
we develop Jr. AI Scientist, a state-of-the-art autonomous AI scientist system
that mimics the core research workflow of a novice student researcher: Given
the baseline paper from the human mentor, it analyzes its limitations,
formulates novel hypotheses for improvement, validates them through rigorous
experimentation, and writes a paper with the results. Unlike previous
approaches that assume full automation or operate on small-scale code, Jr. AI
Scientist follows a well-defined research workflow and leverages modern coding
agents to handle complex, multi-file implementations, leading to scientifically
valuable contributions. For evaluation, we conducted automated assessments
using AI Reviewers, author-led evaluations, and submissions to Agents4Science,
a venue dedicated to AI-driven scientific contributions. The findings
demonstrate that Jr. AI Scientist generates papers receiving higher review
scores than existing fully automated systems. Nevertheless, we identify
important limitations from both the author evaluation and the Agents4Science
reviews, indicating the potential risks of directly applying current AI
Scientist systems and key challenges for future research. Finally, we
comprehensively report various risks identified during development. We hope
these insights will deepen understanding of current progress and risks in AI
Scientist development.

### [29] [Are We Asking the Right Questions? On Ambiguity in Natural Language Queries for Tabular Data Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04584)
*Daniel Gomm,Cornelius Wolff,Madelon Hulsebos*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出将自然语言查询中的歧义视为合作交互的特征而非缺陷，开发了一个区分可解决查询与不可解决查询的框架，并分析了15个流行数据集中查询类型的混合问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将查询歧义视为缺陷，本文重新将其定义为合作交互的特征，认为查询规范的责任应由用户和系统共同承担。

Method: 开发了一个原则性框架来区分合作查询（可解决的查询）和非合作查询（无法解决的查询），并将该框架应用于15个流行数据集的评估分析。

Result: 发现这些数据集中的查询类型混合不当，既不适合评估系统执行准确性，也不适合评估解释能力。

Conclusion: 该框架和分析将视角从修复歧义转向在解决查询中拥抱合作，为表格数据的自然语言界面提供了更明智的设计和评估方向。

Abstract: Natural language interfaces to tabular data must handle ambiguities inherent
to queries. Instead of treating ambiguity as a deficiency, we reframe it as a
feature of cooperative interaction, where the responsibility of query
specification is shared among the user and the system. We develop a principled
framework distinguishing cooperative queries, i.e., queries that yield a
resolvable interpretation, from uncooperative queries that cannot be resolved.
Applying the framework to evaluations for tabular question answering and
analysis, we analyze the queries in 15 popular datasets, and observe an
uncontrolled mixing of query types neither adequate for evaluating a system's
execution accuracy nor for evaluating interpretation capabilities. Our
framework and analysis of queries shifts the perspective from fixing ambiguity
to embracing cooperation in resolving queries. This reflection enables more
informed design and evaluation for natural language interfaces for tabular
data, for which we outline implications and directions for future research.

*Soham De,Lodewijk Gelauff,Ashish Goel,Smitha Milli,Ariel Procaccia,Alice Siu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于合理代表(JR)概念的审计框架，用于衡量专家问答环节中问题选择的代表性，并开发了高效的审计算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在公民大会等审议过程中，参与者可以向专家提问，但由于时间限制只能选择少量问题，需要确保所选问题能充分代表所有参与者的利益。

Method: 开发了在一般效用设置下审计合理代表(JR)的算法，最有效算法的时间复杂度为O(mn log n)，其中n是参与者数量，m是问题数量。

Result: 应用审计方法比较了历史审议中三种问题选择方式的代表性：(a)主持人选择的问题，(b)整数线性规划选择的问题，(c)大语言模型生成的摘要问题。

Conclusion: 研究结果凸显了大语言模型在支持审议过程中的潜力和当前局限性，通过将方法集成到在线审议平台，使实践者能够审计和改进未来审议的代表性。

Abstract: A central feature of many deliberative processes, such as citizens'
assemblies and deliberative polls, is the opportunity for participants to
engage directly with experts. While participants are typically invited to
propose questions for expert panels, only a limited number can be selected due
to time constraints. This raises the challenge of how to choose a small set of
questions that best represent the interests of all participants. We introduce
an auditing framework for measuring the level of representation provided by a
slate of questions, based on the social choice concept known as justified
representation (JR). We present the first algorithms for auditing JR in the
general utility setting, with our most efficient algorithm achieving a runtime
of $O(mn\log n)$, where $n$ is the number of participants and $m$ is the number
of proposed questions. We apply our auditing methods to historical
deliberations, comparing the representativeness of (a) the actual questions
posed to the expert panel (chosen by a moderator), (b) participants' questions
chosen via integer linear programming, (c) summary questions generated by large
language models (LLMs). Our results highlight both the promise and current
limitations of LLMs in supporting deliberative processes. By integrating our
methods into an online deliberation platform that has been used for over
hundreds of deliberations across more than 50 countries, we make it easy for
practitioners to audit and improve representation in future deliberations.

*Narjes Nourzad,Hanqing Yang,Shiyu Chen,Carlee Joe-Wong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DR.WELL是一个去中心化的神经符号框架，用于协作多智能体规划，通过两阶段协商协议和符号规划避免轨迹级协调的脆弱性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多智能体在部分信息和有限通信下进行联合决策的挑战，避免轨迹级协调因微小偏差导致冲突的问题。

Method: 采用两阶段协商协议：智能体首先提出候选角色并推理，然后在共识和环境约束下承诺联合分配；之后每个智能体独立生成和执行符号计划，通过共享世界模型进行执行结果落地。

Result: 在协作推块任务实验中，智能体能够跨episode适应，动态世界模型捕获可重用模式，提高了任务完成率和效率。

Conclusion: 通过符号规划而非原始轨迹推理，DR.WELL避免了脆弱的步级对齐，实现了可重用、可同步和可解释的高层操作，以时间开销换取演化出更高效的协作策略。

Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent planning requires agents to make joint decisions with
partial information and limited communication. Coordination at the trajectory
level often fails, as small deviations in timing or movement cascade into
conflicts. Symbolic planning mitigates this challenge by raising the level of
abstraction and providing a minimal vocabulary of actions that enable
synchronization and collective progress. We present DR. WELL, a decentralized
neurosymbolic framework for cooperative multi-agent planning. Cooperation
unfolds through a two-phase negotiation protocol: agents first propose
candidate roles with reasoning and then commit to a joint allocation under
consensus and environment constraints. After commitment, each agent
independently generates and executes a symbolic plan for its role without
revealing detailed trajectories. Plans are grounded in execution outcomes via a
shared world model that encodes the current state and is updated as agents act.
By reasoning over symbolic plans rather than raw trajectories, DR. WELL avoids
brittle step-level alignment and enables higher-level operations that are
reusable, synchronizable, and interpretable. Experiments on cooperative
block-push tasks show that agents adapt across episodes, with the dynamic world
model capturing reusable patterns and improving task completion rates and
efficiency. Experiments on cooperative block-push tasks show that our dynamic
world model improves task completion and efficiency through negotiation and
self-refinement, trading a time overhead for evolving, more efficient
collaboration strategies.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VeriCoT是一个神经符号方法，从CoT推理中提取并验证形式逻辑论证，通过一阶逻辑形式化推理步骤，使用自动求解器验证逻辑有效性，提高推理可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs通过CoT进行多步推理，但无法可靠验证自身逻辑，即使在正确答案下底层推理也可能存在缺陷，这在高风险场景中削弱了信任。

Method: VeriCoT将每个CoT推理步骤形式化为一级逻辑，识别基于源上下文、常识知识或先前推理步骤的前提，使用符号表示和自动求解器验证逻辑有效性。

Result: 在ProofWriter、LegalBench和BioASQ数据集上的实验显示，VeriCoT能有效识别有缺陷的推理，并作为最终答案正确性的强预测器。

Conclusion: VeriCoT的验证信号可用于推理时自我反思、监督微调和偏好微调，进一步提高了推理有效性和准确性。

Abstract: LLMs can perform multi-step reasoning through Chain-of-Thought (CoT), but
they cannot reliably verify their own logic. Even when they reach correct
answers, the underlying reasoning may be flawed, undermining trust in
high-stakes scenarios. To mitigate this issue, we introduce VeriCoT, a
neuro-symbolic method that extracts and verifies formal logical arguments from
CoT reasoning. VeriCoT formalizes each CoT reasoning step into first-order
logic and identifies premises that ground the argument in source context,
commonsense knowledge, or prior reasoning steps. The symbolic representation
enables automated solvers to verify logical validity while the NL premises
allow humans and systems to identify ungrounded or fallacious reasoning steps.
Experiments on the ProofWriter, LegalBench, and BioASQ datasets show VeriCoT
effectively identifies flawed reasoning, and serves as a strong predictor of
final answer correctness. We also leverage VeriCoT's verification signal for
(1) inference-time self-reflection, (2) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on
VeriCoT-distilled datasets and (3) preference fine-tuning (PFT) with direct
preference optimization (DPO) using verification-based pairwise rewards,
further improving reasoning validity and accuracy.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了排队系统中到达率和服务率的联合控制问题，旨在最小化长期期望成本减去收益。尽管目标函数是非凸的，但通过变量变换揭示了隐藏的凸性结构，证明了PLK条件，确保了一阶方法的全局收敛性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然排队系统的联合控制目标函数是非凸的，但一阶方法在实践中被观察到能收敛到全局最优解。本文旨在为这一经验现象提供理论解释。

Method: 通过适当的变量变换，将原问题转化为凸优化问题，建立了Polyak-Lojasiewicz-Kurdyka (PLK)条件，并证明了交通强度平方根变换下期望队列长度的凸性。

Result: 证明了原控制问题满足PLK条件，排除了虚假局部最小值，确保了一阶方法的全局收敛性。分析适用于广泛的GI/GI/1排队模型，包括Gamma分布的情况。

Conclusion: 排队系统的联合控制问题具有隐藏的凸性结构，通过适当的数学变换可以揭示这一特性，为一阶方法的全局收敛性提供了理论保证。

Abstract: We study the joint control of arrival and service rates in queueing systems
with the objective of minimizing long-run expected cost minus revenue. Although
the objective function is non-convex, first-order methods have been empirically
observed to converge to globally optimal solutions. This paper provides a
theoretical foundation for this empirical phenomenon by characterizing the
optimization landscape and identifying a hidden convexity: the problem admits a
convex reformulation after an appropriate change of variables. Leveraging this
hidden convexity, we establish the Polyak-Lojasiewicz-Kurdyka (PLK) condition
for the original control problem, which excludes spurious local minima and
ensures global convergence for first-order methods. Our analysis applies to a
broad class of $GI/GI/1$ queueing models, including those with
Gamma-distributed interarrival and service times. As a key ingredient in the
proof, we establish a new convexity property of the expected queue length under
a square-root transformation of the traffic intensity.

Conclusion: 研究结果为离散时间系统集合的最优控制奠定了坚实基础，为未来研究开辟了许多有趣的方向。

Abstract: The control of ensembles of dynamical systems is an intriguing and
challenging problem, arising for example in quantum control. We initiate the
investigation of optimal control of ensembles of discrete-time systems,
focusing on minimising the average finite horizon cost over the ensemble. For
very general nonlinear control systems and stage and terminal costs, we
establish existence of minimisers under mild assumptions. Furthermore, we
provide a $\Gamma$-convergence result which enables consistent approximation of
the challenging ensemble optimal control problem, for example, by using
empirical probability measures over the ensemble. Our results form a solid
foundation for discrete-time optimal control of ensembles, with many
interesting avenues for future research.

accelerates optimization convergence. Experimental results on public datasets
demonstrate that the final model achieves competitive localization accuracy and
exhibits remarkable generalization capability. This study provides new insights
for developing high-performance offline positioning systems.

Motivation: 研究桥梁路面在有真实和人工障碍物情况下的优化问题，真实障碍物需要避免碰撞，人工障碍物用于增强结构稳定性。

Method: 针对真实障碍物建立最坏情况优化问题，最小化相对于密度分布的振荡幅度；针对人工障碍物，最小化量化板长边位移间隙函数的最大值。

Result: 为两个问题提供了存在性结果，并讨论了最优密度分布和障碍物的定性性质。

Conclusion: 成功建立了两种不同类型障碍物下的板结构优化问题，并获得了理论存在性结果和定性分析。

Abstract: We study optimization problems for partially hinged rectangular plates,
modeling bridge roadways, in the presence of real and artificial obstacles.
Real obstacles represent structural constraints to avoid, while artificial ones
are introduced to enhance stability. For the former, aiming to prevent
collisions, we set up a worst-case optimization problem in which we minimize
the amplitude of oscillations with respect to the density distribution; for the
latter, aiming to improve the torsional stability, we minimize, with respect to
the obstacles, the maximum of a gap function quantifying the displacement
between the long edges of the plate. For both problems, existence results are
provided, along with a discussion about qualitative properties of optimal
density distributions and obstacles.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 处理非Lipschitz非线性系统，传统线性化方法在大规模设置中不可行，需要一种维度仅随输入数量增长的高效逼近方法。

Method: 使用签名（rough paths理论中的迭代积分）构建通用双线性系统来逼近非线性系统，然后针对不稳定双线性系统开发模型降阶方法。

Result: 签名方法在大规模设置中可行，模型降阶方法能产生潜在低维双线性模型，仅需数据即可学习签名的线性映射。

Conclusion: 该方法在高效建模/数据拟合和非线性系统模型降阶方面具有重要应用价值，数值实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: This paper deals with non-Lipschitz nonlinear systems. Such systems can be
approximated by a linear map of so-called signatures, which play a crucial role
in the theory of rough paths and can be interpreted as collections of iterated
integrals involving the control process. As a consequence, we identify a
universal bilinear system, solved by the signature, that can approximate the
state or output of the original nonlinear dynamics arbitrarily well. In
contrast to other (bi)linearization techniques, the signature approach remains
feasible in large-scale settings, as the dimension of the associated bilinear
system grows only with the number of inputs. However, the signature model is
typically of high order, requiring an optimization process based on model order
reduction (MOR). We derive an MOR method for unstable bilinear systems with
non-zero initial states and apply it to the signature, yielding a potentially
low-dimensional bilinear model. An advantage of our method is that the original
nonlinear system need not be known explicitly, since only data are required to
learn the linear map of the signature. The subsequent MOR procedure is
model-oriented and specifically designed for the signature process.
Consequently, this work has two main applications: (1) efficient modeling/data
fitting using small-scale bilinear systems, and (2) MOR for nonlinear systems.
We illustrate the effectiveness of our approach in the second application
through numerical experiments.

Motivation: 探索最大熵采样和0/1 D最优性这两个基础非线性0/1优化问题之间的深层联系，以改进现有的上界估计方法和分支定界算法。

Method: 通过建立问题实例之间的映射关系，在不同问题间传输上界估计方法，分析分支定界方案的比较性能。

Result: 建立了新的支配关系和其他基本上界不等式，发现某些在直接应用于真实数据MESP实例时表现不佳的边界方法，在来自0/1 D最优性的MESP实例中变得有用。

Conclusion: 两个问题之间的映射关系为改进优化算法提供了新的途径，特别是在边界估计和分支定界策略方面取得了显著进展。

Abstract: We establish strong connections between two fundamental nonlinear 0/1
optimization problems coming from the area of experimental design, namely
maximum entropy sampling and 0/1 D-Optimality. The connections are based on
maps between instances, and we analyze the behavior of these maps. Using these
maps, we transport basic upper-bounding methods between these two problems, and
we are able to establish new domination results and other inequalities relating
various basic upper bounds. Further, we establish results relating how
different branch-and-bound schemes based on these maps compare. Additionally,
we observe some surprising numerical results, where bounding methods that did
not seem promising in their direct application to real-data MESP instances, are
now useful for MESP instances that come from 0/1 D-Optimality.

Conclusion: 通过计算方法成功确定了多种小图在不同拉姆齐设置下的精确数值，扩展了拉姆齐理论的应用范围。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate three extensions of Ramsey numbers to other
combinatorial settings.
  We first consider ordered Ramsey numbers. Here, we ask for a monochromatic
copy of a linearly ordered graph $G$ in every $2$-edge-coloring of a linearly
ordered complete graph $K_n$. The smallest such $n$ is denoted by $\vec{R}(G)$.
  Next, we study canonical Ramsey numbers. A canonical coloring of a linearly
ordered graph $G$ is an edge-coloring in which $G$ is monochromatic, rainbow,
or min/max-lexicographic. In the latter case, each pair of edges receives the
same color if and only if they share the same first (respectively, second)
vertex. Erd\H{o}s and Rado showed that for every $p$ there exists $n$ such that
every edge-coloring of a linearly ordered $K_n$ contains a canonical copy of
$K_p$; the smallest such $n$ is denoted by $ER(G)$.
  Finally, we examine unordered canonical Ramsey numbers, introduced by Richer.
An edge-coloring of $G$ is orderable if there exists a linear ordering of its
vertices such that the color of each edge is determined by its first vertex.
Unlike lexicographic colorings, this notion also includes monochromatic
colorings. Richer proved that for all $s$ and $t$, there exists $n$ such that
every edge-coloring of $K_n$ contains an orderable copy of $K_s$ or a rainbow
$K_t$. The smallest such $n$ is denoted by $CR(s,t)$.
  In all three settings, we focus on determining the corresponding Ramsey
numbers for small graphs $G$. We use tabu search and integer programming to
obtain lower bounds, and flag algebras or integer programming to establish
upper bounds. Among other results, we determine $\vec{R}(G)$ for all graphs $G$
on up to four vertices except $K_4^-$, $ER(P_4)$ for all orderings of $P_4$,
and the exact values $CR(6,3)=26$ and $CR(3,5)=13$.

Motivation: 解决在共同噪声不确定性下的多智能体系统优化问题，其中共同噪声影响所有智能体的状态动态，但其真实分布未知。

Method: 将鲁棒均值场控制问题与提升的鲁棒马尔可夫决策问题联系起来，建立动态规划原理和Bellman-Isaac不动点定理。

Conclusion: 该框架为处理共同噪声不确定性下的均值场控制问题提供了理论基础和实用方法，在分布规划和金融系统性风险中具有应用价值。

Abstract: We propose and analyze a framework for discrete-time robust mean-field
control problems under common noise uncertainty. In this framework, the
mean-field interaction describes the collective behavior of infinitely many
cooperative agents' state and action, while the common noise -- a random
disturbance affecting all agents' state dynamics -- is uncertain. A social
planner optimizes over open-loop controls on an infinite horizon to maximize
the representative agent's worst-case expected reward, where worst-case
corresponds to the most adverse probability measure among all candidates
inducing the unknown true law of the common noise process. We refer to this
optimization as a robust mean-field control problem under common noise
uncertainty. We first show that this problem arises as the asymptotic limit of
a cooperative $N$-agent robust optimization problem, commonly known as
propagation of chaos. We then prove the existence of an optimal open-loop
control by linking the robust mean field control problem to a lifted robust
Markov decision problem on the space of probability measures and by
establishing the dynamic programming principle and Bellman--Isaac fixed point
theorem for the lifted robust Markov decision problem. Finally, we complement
our theoretical results with numerical experiments motivated by distribution
planning and systemic risk in finance, highlighting the advantages of
accounting for common noise uncertainty.

TL;DR: 本文研究了广义逆线性规划的可行性问题，分析了在参数化目标函数和约束条件下，判断是否存在最优解属于目标集Y的复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究广义逆线性规划可行性问题的动机在于理解参数选择对最优解性质的影响，特别是在目标集约束下的决策复杂度。

Method: 通过分析目标集Y的结构、LP形式、可调参数和场景类型，研究不同情况下的计算复杂度，包括标准形式与自然形式的对比。

Result: 当Y为单点集时，标准形式LP问题可解但自然形式NP难；当给定目标基B时，乐观情况下NP完全但悲观情况可解；部分固定目标解时NP难但参数可解。

Conclusion: 广义逆线性规划可行性问题的复杂度高度依赖于目标集结构、LP形式和场景类型，证明了多类问题的NP成员性并讨论了扩展方法。

Abstract: We investigate the feasibility problem for generalized inverse linear
programs. Given an LP with affinely parametrized objective function and
right-hand side as well as a target set Y, the goal is to decide whether the
parameters can be chosen such that there exists an optimal solution that
belongs to Y (optimistic scenario) or such that all optimal solutions belong to
Y (pessimistic scenario). We study the complexity of this decision problem and
show how it depends on the structure of the set Y, the form of the LP, the
adjustable parameters, and the underlying scenario. For a target singleton Y =
{y}, we show that the problem is tractable if the given LP is in standard form,
but NP-hard if the LP is given in natural form. If instead we are given a
target basis B, the problem in standard form becomes NP-complete in the
optimistic case, while remaining tractable in the pessimistic case. For
partially fixed target solutions, the problem gets almost immediately NP-hard,
but we prove fixed-parameter tractability in the number of non-fixed variables.
Moreover, we give a rigorous proof of membership in NP for any polyhedral
target set, and discuss how this property can be extended to more general
target sets using an oracle-based approach.

Abstract: Variance reduction is a family of powerful mechanisms for stochastic
optimization that appears to be helpful in many machine learning tasks. It is
based on estimating the exact gradient with some recursive sequences.
Previously, many papers demonstrated that methods with unbiased
variance-reduction estimators can be described in a single framework. We
generalize this approach and show that the unbiasedness assumption is
excessive; hence, we include biased estimators in this analysis. But the main
contribution of our work is the proposition of new variance reduction methods
with adaptive step sizes that are adjusted throughout the algorithm iterations
and, moreover, do not need hyperparameter tuning. Our analysis covers finite-
sum problems, distributed optimization, and coordinate methods. Numerical
experiments in various tasks validate the effectiveness of our methods.

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 本文证明了Knothe-Rosenblatt重排可以通过带软约束的加权成本最优输运问题的松弛解序列的极限获得，并扩展至动态最优输运中的三角速度场构造。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Knothe-Rosenblatt重排在数学和统计学中有广泛应用，但现有方法将其作为加权二次成本最优输运映射序列的极限获得。本文旨在通过松弛问题扩展这一结果。

Method: 使用带软约束的加权成本最优输运问题的松弛解序列，证明KR映射可作为该序列的极限获得，并扩展至动态最优输运中的三角速度场构造。

Result: 成功证明了KR映射可通过松弛最优输运问题的解序列极限获得，为实际估计KR映射的变分方法提供了理论依据。

Conclusion: 该工作为KR映射的静态和动态最优输运估计器开辟了新可能性，并证明了现有变分方法的合理性。

Abstract: In the theory of optimal transport, the Knothe-Rosenblatt (KR) rearrangement
provides an explicit construction to map between two probability measures by
building one-dimensional transformations from the marginal conditionals of one
measure to the other. The KR map has shown to be useful in different realms of
mathematics and statistics, from proving functional inequalities to designing
methodologies for sampling conditional distributions. It is known that the KR
rearrangement can be obtained as the limit of a sequence of optimal transport
maps with a weighted quadratic cost. We extend these results in this work by
showing that one can obtain the KR map as a limit of maps that solve a
relaxation of the weighted-cost optimal transport problem with a
soft-constraint for the target distribution. In addition, we show that this
procedure also applies to the construction of triangular velocity fields via
dynamic optimal transport yielding optimal velocity fields. This justifies
various variational methodologies for estimating KR maps in practice by
minimizing a divergence between the target and pushforward measure through an
approximate map. Moreover, it opens the possibilities for novel static and
dynamic OT estimators for KR maps.

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个结合计算流体动力学模型和学习型自适应控制的框架，用于解决固体燃料冲压发动机的推力调节挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 固体燃料冲压发动机在长距离高速飞行中具有紧凑、能量密度高的优势，但由于强非线性、有限作动能力和复杂的多物理场耦合，推力调节面临重大挑战。

Method: 开发了包含热添加的CFD模型来表征推力响应，并应用基于回顾成本自适应控制算法的自适应PI控制器进行在线推力调节。

Result: 闭环仿真表明，基于RCAC的控制器在静态和动态操作条件下都能实现精确的推力调节，并对指令、超参数和进气道状态变化保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: RCAC非常适合SFRJ控制，特别是在难以获得精确降阶模型的情况下，学习型自适应控制有潜力在未来吸气式推进应用中实现SFRJ的稳健可靠运行。

Abstract: Solid-fuel ramjets offer a compact, energy-dense propulsion option for
long-range, high-speed flight but pose significant challenges for thrust
regulation due to strong nonlinearities, limited actuation authority, and
complex multi-physics coupling between fuel regression, combustion, and
compressible flow. This paper presents a computational and control framework
that combines a computational fluid dynamics model of an SFRJ with a
learning-based adaptive control approach. A CFD model incorporating heat
addition was developed to characterize thrust response, establish the
operational envelope, and identify the onset of inlet unstart. An adaptive
proportional-integral controller, updated online using the retrospective cost
adaptive control (RCAC) algorithm, was then applied to regulate thrust.
Closed-loop simulations demonstrate that the RCAC-based controller achieves
accurate thrust regulation under both static and dynamic operating conditions,
while remaining robust to variations in commands, hyperparameters, and inlet
states. The results highlight the suitability of RCAC for SFRJ control, where
accurate reduced-order models are challenging to obtain, and underscore the
potential of learning-based adaptive control to enable robust and reliable
operation of SFRJs in future air-breathing propulsion applications.

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 本文针对离散Wasserstein重心问题开发了多项式时间近似方案(PTAS)，将现有最佳近似比从2提升到任意接近1，并在等权重情况下获得更紧的近似保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离散Wasserstein重心问题是NP难的，现有最佳算法只能达到2-近似比，需要开发更精确的近似算法来解决这一在机器学习和运筹学中常见的问题。

Method: 开发了多项式时间近似方案(PTAS)，改进了现有的2-近似方法，并在等权重情况下获得了更紧的近似保证。

Result: 提出的算法在计算上高效，能产生接近最优的重心解，数值实验验证了其性能。

Conclusion: 本文成功缩小了离散Wasserstein重心问题的近似比差距，为实际应用提供了更精确高效的解决方案。

Abstract: The Wasserstein barycenter problem seeks a probability measure that minimizes
the weighted average of the Wasserstein distances to a given collection of
probability measures. We study the discrete setting, where each measure has
finite support-- a regime that frequently arises in machine learning and
operations research. The discrete Wasserstein barycenter problem is known to be
NP-hard, which motivates us to study approximation algorithms with provable
guarantees. The best-known algorithm to date achieves an approximation ratio of
two. We close this gap by developing a polynomial-time approximation scheme
(PTAS) for the discrete Wasserstein barycenter problem that generalizes and
improves upon the 2-approximation method. In addition, for the special case of
equally weighted measures, we obtain a strictly tighter approximation
guarantee. Numerical experiments show that the proposed algorithms are
computationally efficient and produce near-optimal barycenter solutions.

*Steffen Dereich,Arnulf Jentzen,Sebastian Kassing*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 本文通过ODE方法分析Adam优化器，在快慢尺度机制下证明Adam算法是特定向量场的渐近伪轨迹，并建立了收敛性结果。在一般设置下，Adam收敛时极限必须是Adam向量场的零点而非目标函数的临界点；但在过参数化经验风险最小化设置中，Adam能够局部找到最小值集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adam优化器是目前深度学习中最流行的优化方法，但对其收敛行为的理论理解仍不充分。本文旨在通过ODE方法在快慢尺度机制下系统研究Adam优化器的收敛性质。

Method: 开发基于ODE的方法，在固定动量参数和消失步长条件下，证明Adam算法是Adam向量场的渐近伪轨迹。利用渐近伪轨迹的性质建立收敛结果，并在过参数化经验风险最小化设置中分析局部收敛行为。

Result: 在一般设置下，如果Adam算法收敛，其极限必须是Adam向量场的零点，而非目标函数的局部极小值点或临界点。在过参数化经验风险最小化设置中，目标函数在全局最小值邻域内可作为Adam向量场诱导流的Lyapunov函数，如果Adam算法无限次进入该邻域，则收敛到全局最小值集。

Conclusion: Adam优化器的收敛行为依赖于问题设置：在一般情况下收敛到向量场零点，在过参数化经验风险最小化中能够找到全局最小值。这为理解Adam优化器的理论性质提供了重要见解。

Abstract: The Adam optimizer is currently presumably the most popular optimization
method in deep learning. In this article we develop an ODE based method to
study the Adam optimizer in a fast-slow scaling regime. For fixed momentum
parameters and vanishing step-sizes, we show that the Adam algorithm is an
asymptotic pseudo-trajectory of the flow of a particular vector field, which is
referred to as the Adam vector field. Leveraging properties of asymptotic
pseudo-trajectories, we establish convergence results for the Adam algorithm.
In particular, in a very general setting we show that if the Adam algorithm
converges, then the limit must be a zero of the Adam vector field, rather than
a local minimizer or critical point of the objective function.
  In contrast, in the overparametrized empirical risk minimization setting, the
Adam algorithm is able to locally find the set of minima. Specifically, we show
that in a neighborhood of the global minima, the objective function serves as a
Lyapunov function for the flow induced by the Adam vector field. As a
consequence, if the Adam algorithm enters a neighborhood of the global minima
infinitely often, it converges to the set of global minima.

Abstract: Grasslands, constituting the world's second-largest terrestrial carbon sink,
play a crucial role in biodiversity and the regulation of the carbon cycle.
Currently, the Irish dairy sector, a significant economic contributor, grapples
with challenges related to profitability and sustainability. Presently, grass
growth forecasting relies on impractical mechanistic models. In response, we

provides insights into optimal model configurations. This study enhances our
understanding of model behavior, thereby improving reliability in grass growth
forecasting and contributing to the advancement of sustainable dairy farming

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于联邦学习和GAF图像转换的隐私保护ECG分类框架，在IoT医疗环境中实现95.18%的高分类准确率，同时确保医疗数据本地化处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决IoT医疗环境中ECG分类的隐私保护问题，避免敏感医疗数据集中存储和传输，同时应对异构IoT设备的资源限制挑战。

Method: 将1D ECG信号转换为2D GAF图像，使用CNN进行特征提取，采用联邦学习框架在服务器、笔记本和树莓派4等异构设备上部署，实现数据本地化处理。

Result: 在多客户端设置下达到95.18%的分类准确率，显著优于单客户端基线，在准确率和训练时间上均有优势，同时保持高效的资源利用和通信开销。

Conclusion: 该框架展示了轻量级、隐私保护的AI在IoT医疗监测中的潜力，支持智能健康系统中可扩展且安全的边缘部署。

Abstract: This study presents a federated learning (FL) framework for
privacy-preserving electrocardiogram (ECG) classification in Internet of Things
(IoT) healthcare environments. By transforming 1D ECG signals into 2D Gramian
Angular Field (GAF) images, the proposed approach enables efficient feature
extraction through Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) while ensuring that
sensitive medical data remain local to each device. This work is among the
first to experimentally validate GAF-based federated ECG classification across
heterogeneous IoT devices, quantifying both performance and communication
efficiency. To evaluate feasibility in realistic IoT settings, we deployed the
framework across a server, a laptop, and a resource-constrained Raspberry Pi 4,
reflecting edge-cloud integration in IoT ecosystems. Experimental results
demonstrate that the FL-GAF model achieves a high classification accuracy of
95.18% in a multi-client setup, significantly outperforming a single-client
baseline in both accuracy and training time. Despite the added computational
complexity of GAF transformations, the framework maintains efficient resource
utilization and communication overhead. These findings highlight the potential
of lightweight, privacy-preserving AI for IoT-based healthcare monitoring,
supporting scalable and secure edge deployments in smart health systems.

TL;DR: LOLGORITHM是一个用于短视频评论生成的多智能体系统，支持六种不同风格的评论生成，在抖音和YouTube上获得了超过90%的用户偏好率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 短视频平台中评论对于促进社区参与和内容再创作至关重要，但生成既符合平台规范又具有风格多样性和上下文感知的评论仍然是一个挑战。

Method: 采用模块化多智能体系统，集成视频分割、上下文和情感分析、风格感知提示构建，使用多模态大语言模型直接处理视频输入，通过显式提示标记和少量示例实现细粒度风格控制。

Result: 在包含40个视频和105名参与者的大规模人类偏好研究中，LOLGORITHM显著优于基线模型，在抖音上获得超过90%的偏好率，在YouTube上获得87.55%的偏好率。

Conclusion: 这项工作为短视频平台上的风格化评论生成提供了一个可扩展和文化适应的框架，为增强用户参与度和创造性互动提供了有前景的路径。

Abstract: Short-video platforms have become a central medium in the modern Internet
landscape, where efficient information delivery and strong interactivity are
reshaping user engagement and cultural dissemination. Among the various forms
of user interaction, comments play a vital role in fostering community
participation and enabling content re-creation. However, generating comments
that are both compliant with platform guidelines and capable of exhibiting
stylistic diversity and contextual awareness remains a significant challenge.
We introduce LOLGORITHM, a modular multi-agent system (MAS) designed for
controllable short-video comment generation. The system integrates video
segmentation, contextual and affective analysis, and style-aware prompt
construction. It supports six distinct comment styles: puns (homophones),
rhyming, meme application, sarcasm (irony), plain humor, and content
extraction. Powered by a multimodal large language model (MLLM), LOLGORITHM
directly processes video inputs and achieves fine-grained style control through
explicit prompt markers and few-shot examples. To support development and
evaluation, we construct a bilingual dataset using official APIs from Douyin
(Chinese) and YouTube (English), covering five popular video genres: comedy
skits, daily life jokes, funny animal clips, humorous commentary, and talk
shows. Evaluation combines automated metrics originality, relevance, and style
conformity with a large-scale human preference study involving 40 videos and
105 participants. Results show that LOLGORITHM significantly outperforms
baseline models, achieving preference rates of over 90% on Douyin and 87.55% on
YouTube. This work presents a scalable and culturally adaptive framework for
stylized comment generation on short-video platforms, offering a promising path
to enhance user engagement and creative interaction.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为Common-O的新基准测试，用于评估多模态语言模型在真实场景中的推理能力，发现即使是最好的模型在跨场景推理方面仍然表现很差，特别是在复杂场景中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型虽然在感知基准测试上表现良好，但在真实世界场景推理中仍存在严重的幻觉问题，需要新的评估方法来填补这一差距。

Method: 构建了一个包含10,500多个样本的基准测试Common-O，使用网络训练数据中未出现过的新图像，通过"共同点是什么"的问题来测试跨场景推理能力。

Result: 最佳模型在Common-O上仅达到35%准确率，在更复杂的Common-O Complex上仅达到1%。模型在场景中存在相似物体时更容易产生幻觉。

Conclusion: 多图像训练可能提供改进，需要进一步研究来解决跨场景推理中的幻觉问题。

Abstract: Multimodal language models possess a remarkable ability to handle an
open-vocabulary's worth of objects. Yet the best models still suffer from
hallucinations when reasoning about scenes in the real world, revealing a gap
between their seemingly strong performance on existing perception benchmarks
that are saturating and their reasoning in the real world. To address this gap,
we build a novel benchmark of in-the-wild scenes that we call Common-O. With
more than 10.5k examples using exclusively new images not found in web training
data to avoid contamination, Common-O goes beyond just perception, inspired by
cognitive tests for humans, to probe reasoning across scenes by asking "what's
in common?". We evaluate leading multimodal language models, including models
specifically trained to perform chain-of-thought reasoning. We find that
perceiving objects in single images is tractable for most models, yet reasoning
across scenes is very challenging even for the best models, including reasoning
models. Despite saturating many leaderboards focusing on perception, the best
performing model only achieves 35% on Common-O -- and on Common-O Complex,
consisting of more complex scenes, the best model achieves only 1%. Curiously,
we find models are more prone to hallucinate when similar objects are present
in the scene, suggesting models may be relying on object co-occurrence seen
during training. Among the models we evaluated, we found scale can provide
modest improvements while models explicitly trained with multi-image inputs
show bigger improvements, suggesting scaled multi-image training may offer
promise. We make our benchmark publicly available to spur research into the
challenge of hallucination when reasoning across scenes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型使用互联网规模的预训练语料库，可能导致测试集泄漏造成的性能虚高，但现有的检测方法要么完全失效，要么表现不一致，需要开发更有效的检测方法。

Result: 提出的检测方法在多种现实污染策略下都表现良好，验证了其鲁棒性和有效性。

Conclusion: 多模态语义扰动是一种简单而有效的检测视觉语言模型测试集泄漏的方法，能够可靠地识别受污染的模型。

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved
state-of-the-art performance on numerous benchmark tasks. However, the use of
internet-scale, often proprietary, pretraining corpora raises a critical
concern for both practitioners and users: inflated performance due to test-set
leakage. While prior works have proposed mitigation strategies such as
decontamination of pretraining data and benchmark redesign for LLMs, the
complementary direction of developing detection methods for contaminated VLMs
remains underexplored. To address this gap, we deliberately contaminate
open-source VLMs on popular benchmarks and show that existing detection
approaches either fail outright or exhibit inconsistent behavior. We then
propose a novel simple yet effective detection method based on multi-modal
semantic perturbation, demonstrating that contaminated models fail to
generalize under controlled perturbations. Finally, we validate our approach
across multiple realistic contamination strategies, confirming its robustness
and effectiveness. The code and perturbed dataset will be released publicly.

TL;DR: FusionDP是一个特征级差分隐私框架，通过利用基础模型对敏感特征进行估算，在保护隐私的同时提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DP-SGD对所有特征统一施加隐私保护，导致过度噪声注入和性能下降。现实中只有部分特征需要隐私保护，如ICU数据中的人口统计特征比实验室结果更敏感。

Method: 1) 使用基础模型根据非敏感特征估算敏感特征，作为外部先验；2) 改进的DP-SGD算法，在原始特征和估算特征上训练模型，同时保护原始敏感特征的隐私。

Result: 在PhysioNet败血症预测和MIMIC-III临床笔记分类任务上，FusionDP相比隐私保护基线显著提升了模型性能，同时保持了严格的特征级隐私保护。

Conclusion: FusionDP证明了基础模型驱动的估算方法能够有效改善各种模态数据的隐私-效用权衡。

Abstract: Ensuring the privacy of sensitive training data is crucial in
privacy-preserving machine learning. However, in practical scenarios, privacy
protection may be required for only a subset of features. For instance, in ICU
data, demographic attributes like age and gender pose higher privacy risks due
to their re-identification potential, whereas raw lab results are generally
less sensitive. Traditional DP-SGD enforces privacy protection on all features
in one sample, leading to excessive noise injection and significant utility
degradation. We propose FusionDP, a two-step framework that enhances model
utility under feature-level differential privacy. First, FusionDP leverages
large foundation models to impute sensitive features given non-sensitive
features, treating them as external priors that provide high-quality estimates
of sensitive attributes without accessing the true values during model
training. Second, we introduce a modified DP-SGD algorithm that trains models
on both original and imputed features while formally preserving the privacy of
the original sensitive features. We evaluate FusionDP on two modalities: a
sepsis prediction task on tabular data from PhysioNet and a clinical note
classification task from MIMIC-III. By comparing against privacy-preserving
baselines, our results show that FusionDP significantly improves model
performance while maintaining rigorous feature-level privacy, demonstrating the
potential of foundation model-driven imputation to enhance the privacy-utility
trade-off for various modalities.

Motivation: 传统可解释性技术假设静态数据和固定背景分布，当概念漂移发生时，其解释会变得不稳定且可能不公平。

Method: 集成XGBoost预测建模与三种自适应SHAP变体：按切片重新加权、漂移感知重新基准化和在线代理校准。

Conclusion: 自适应可解释性是维持数据驱动信用系统透明度、问责制和伦理可靠性的实用机制。

Abstract: Evolving borrower behaviors, shifting economic conditions, and changing
regulatory landscapes continuously reshape the data distributions underlying
modern credit-scoring systems. Conventional explainability techniques, such as
SHAP, assume static data and fixed background distributions, making their
explanations unstable and potentially unfair when concept drift occurs. This
study addresses that challenge by developing adaptive explanation frameworks
that recalibrate interpretability and fairness in dynamically evolving credit
models. Using a multi-year credit dataset, we integrate predictive modeling via
XGBoost with three adaptive SHAP variants: (A) per-slice explanation
reweighting that adjusts for feature distribution shifts, (B) drift-aware SHAP
rebaselining with sliding-window background samples, and (C) online surrogate
calibration using incremental Ridge regression. Each method is benchmarked
against static SHAP explanations using metrics of predictive performance (AUC,
F1), directional and rank stability (cosine, Kendall tau), and fairness
(demographic parity and recalibration). Results show that adaptive methods,
particularly rebaselined and surrogate-based explanations, substantially
improve temporal stability and reduce disparate impact across demographic
groups without degrading predictive accuracy. Robustness tests, including
counterfactual perturbations, background sensitivity analysis, and
proxy-variable detection, confirm the resilience of adaptive explanations under
real-world drift conditions. These findings establish adaptive explainability
as a practical mechanism for sustaining transparency, accountability, and
ethical reliability in data-driven credit systems, and more broadly, in any
domain where decision models evolve with population change.

Motivation: 推理语言模型在复杂任务上表现良好，但由于其规模和长推理轨迹，部署成本高昂。

Method: 使用s1.1-32B的中间表示训练轻量级预测器，预测问题难度或模型正确性，以指导在推理模型池中的路由分配。

Result: 在多样化数学基准测试中，路由方法比随机分配更高效，匹配s1.1-32B的性能，同时显著减少计算量。

Conclusion: 难度感知路由对于推理模型的成本高效部署是有效的。

Abstract: Reasoning language models perform well on complex tasks but are costly to
deploy due to their size and long reasoning traces. We propose a routing
approach that assigns each problem to the smallest model likely to solve it,
reducing compute without sacrificing accuracy. Using intermediate
representations from s1.1-32B, we train lightweight predictors of problem
difficulty or model correctness to guide routing across a pool of reasoning
models. On diverse math benchmarks, routing improves efficiency over random
assignment and matches s1.1-32B's performance while using significantly less
compute. Our results demonstrate that difficulty-aware routing is effective for
cost-efficient deployment of reasoning models.

TL;DR: DEBA是一种自适应批次大小调度器，通过监测梯度方差、梯度范数变化和损失变化来指导批次大小调整。研究发现架构决定适应效果：轻量级架构获得45-62%速度提升和1-7%精度提升，ResNet-18有稳定增益，ResNet-50表现不稳定，ViT-B16受益最小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自适应批次大小方法对所有架构采用相同策略，假设通用解决方案。但不同神经网络架构可能对批次大小适应有不同的响应，需要架构感知的设计。

Method: 引入DEBA自适应批次调度器，监测梯度方差、梯度范数变化和损失变化。使用滑动窗口统计而非完整历史，设置足够冷却期（5+轮次）。在6种架构上系统评估，每种配置5个随机种子。

Result: 轻量级和中深度架构获得45-62%训练加速和1-7%精度提升；ResNet-18精度提升2.4-4.0%，速度提升36-43%；ResNet-50表现高方差；ViT-B16仅6%速度提升。梯度稳定性指标可预测架构受益程度。

Conclusion: 自适应方法不能跨架构通用，批次大小适应需要架构感知设计。滑动窗口统计和足够冷却期是关键设计选择，挑战了现有假设。

Abstract: Adaptive batch size methods aim to accelerate neural network training, but
existing approaches apply identical adaptation strategies across all
architectures, assuming a one-size-fits-all solution. We introduce DEBA
(Dynamic Efficient Batch Adaptation), an adaptive batch scheduler that monitors
gradient variance, gradient norm variation and loss variation to guide batch
size adaptations. Through systematic evaluation across six architectures
(ResNet-18/50, DenseNet-121, EfficientNet-B0, MobileNet-V3, ViT-B16) on
CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, with five random seeds per configuration, we
demonstrate that the architecture fundamentally determines adaptation efficacy.
Our findings reveal that: (1) lightweight and medium-depth architectures
(MobileNet-V3, DenseNet-121, EfficientNet-B0) achieve a 45-62% training speedup
with simultaneous accuracy improvements of 1-7%; (2) shallow residual networks
(ResNet-18) show consistent gains of +2.4 - 4.0% in accuracy, 36 - 43% in
speedup, while deep residual networks (ResNet-50) exhibit high variance and
occasional degradation; (3) already-stable architectures (ViT-B16) show minimal
speedup (6%) despite maintaining accuracy, indicating that adaptation benefits
vary with baseline optimization characteristics. We introduce a baseline
characterization framework using gradient stability metrics (stability score,
gradient norm variation) that predicts which architectures will benefit from
adaptive scheduling. Our ablation studies reveal critical design choices often
overlooked in prior work: sliding window statistics (vs. full history) and
sufficient cooldown periods (5+ epochs) between adaptations are essential for
success. This work challenges the prevailing assumption that adaptive methods
generalize across architectures and provides the first systematic evidence that
batch size adaptation requires an architecture-aware design.

*Ryien Hosseini,Filippo Simini,Venkatram Vishwanath,Rebecca Willett,Henry Hoffmann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为"Sketched Random Features"的方法，通过向标准GNN注入随机全局节点特征嵌入，有效解决GNN的长距离信息压缩、节点表示过度平滑和表达能力受限等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNN在聚合局部邻域信息时面临三个关键挑战：(i)长距离信息压缩，(ii)节点表示过度平滑，(iii)表达能力有限。需要一种高效捕捉长距离依赖关系的方法。

Method: 向标准GNN注入随机全局节点特征嵌入（Sketched Random Features），这些嵌入具有唯一性、距离敏感性和拓扑无关性。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法在真实世界图学习任务中持续提升基线GNN性能，既可独立使用也可作为图位置编码等现有技术的补充增强。

Conclusion: Sketched Random Features方法能有效缓解GNN的固有局限性，为图神经网络提供了捕捉长距离依赖关系的高效解决方案。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks learn on graph-structured data by iteratively
aggregating local neighborhood information. While this local message passing
paradigm imparts a powerful inductive bias and exploits graph sparsity, it also
yields three key challenges: (i) oversquashing of long-range information, (ii)
oversmoothing of node representations, and (iii) limited expressive power. In
this work we inject randomized global embeddings of node features, which we
term \textit{Sketched Random Features}, into standard GNNs, enabling them to
efficiently capture long-range dependencies. The embeddings are unique,
distance-sensitive, and topology-agnostic -- properties which we analytically
and empirically show alleviate the aforementioned limitations when injected
into GNNs. Experimental results on real-world graph learning tasks confirm that
this strategy consistently improves performance over baseline GNNs, offering
both a standalone solution and a complementary enhancement to existing
techniques such as graph positional encodings. Our source code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: StratDiff是一种创新的离线到在线强化学习方法，通过扩散模型学习离线数据先验知识，利用能量函数改进策略模仿，并通过KL散度将训练样本分层为离线类和在线类，分别采用不同的学习策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决离线到在线强化学习中由于固定行为策略与演化策略之间的分布偏移问题，现有方法很少明确评估或利用离线数据的分布结构，存在适应不同样本类型的学习策略研究空白。

Method: 使用扩散模型学习离线数据集先验知识，通过能量函数改进策略模仿并生成离线类动作，计算生成动作与采样动作的KL散度来分层训练批次，离线类样本使用离线目标更新，在线类样本采用在线学习策略。

Result: 在D4RL基准测试上的广泛实证评估表明，StratDiff显著优于现有方法，与Cal-QL和IQL集成后实现了增强的适应性和更稳定的性能。

Conclusion: StratDiff通过显式利用离线数据的分布结构，有效解决了离线到在线强化学习中的分布偏移问题，为不同样本类型提供了适应性的学习策略。

Abstract: Transitioning from offline to online reinforcement learning (RL) poses
critical challenges due to distributional shifts between the fixed behavior
policy in the offline dataset and the evolving policy during online learning.
Although this issue is widely recognized, few methods attempt to explicitly
assess or utilize the distributional structure of the offline data itself,
leaving a research gap in adapting learning strategies to different types of
samples. To address this challenge, we propose an innovative method,
Energy-Guided Diffusion Stratification (StratDiff), which facilitates smoother
transitions in offline-to-online RL. StratDiff deploys a diffusion model to
learn prior knowledge from the offline dataset. It then refines this knowledge
through energy-based functions to improve policy imitation and generate
offline-like actions during online fine-tuning. The KL divergence between the
generated action and the corresponding sampled action is computed for each
sample and used to stratify the training batch into offline-like and
online-like subsets. Offline-like samples are updated using offline objectives,
while online-like samples follow online learning strategies. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of StratDiff by integrating it with off-the-shelf methods Cal-QL
and IQL. Extensive empirical evaluations on D4RL benchmarks show that StratDiff
significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving enhanced adaptability and
more stable performance across diverse RL settings.

TL;DR: 本文扩展了因果加性模型(CAM)以处理高阶交互作用，引入了有向无环超图(hyper DAG)来表示这种结构，提供了可识别性理论结果，并开发了相应的学习算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的许多过程都表现出高阶机制，但因果发现中对交互作用的显式处理却很少受到关注。本文旨在将因果加性模型扩展到包含高阶交互作用的加性模型。

Method: 扩展因果加性模型(CAM)到包含高阶交互作用的加性模型，使用有向无环超图表示结构，提供理论可识别性结果，并开发了贪婪CAM算法的扩展版本。

Result: 证明了更复杂超图结构的学习可能带来更好的实证结果，限制性更强的假设如CAM对应于更容易学习的超DAG和更好的有限样本复杂度。

Conclusion: 通过引入有向无环超图扩展了因果结构学习框架，为处理高阶交互作用提供了理论基础和实用算法，在合成实验中展示了其经验价值。

Abstract: Causal structure learning has long been the central task of inferring causal
insights from data. Despite the abundance of real-world processes exhibiting
higher-order mechanisms, however, an explicit treatment of interactions in
causal discovery has received little attention. In this work, we focus on
extending the causal additive model (CAM) to additive models with higher-order
interactions. This second level of modularity we introduce to the structure
learning problem is most easily represented by a directed acyclic hypergraph
which extends the DAG. We introduce the necessary definitions and theoretical
tools to handle the novel structure we introduce and then provide
identifiability results for the hyper DAG, extending the typical Markov
equivalence classes. We next provide insights into why learning the more
complex hypergraph structure may actually lead to better empirical results. In
particular, more restrictive assumptions like CAM correspond to easier-to-learn
hyper DAGs and better finite sample complexity. We finally develop an extension
of the greedy CAM algorithm which can handle the more complex hyper DAG search
space and demonstrate its empirical usefulness in synthetic experiments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出SADQ方法，通过建模环境动态和整合后继状态分布来改进DQN，解决目标更新中因使用过时策略生成的状态导致的高方差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DQN从回放缓冲区采样转换进行学习，但目标更新依赖过去次优策略生成的下一个状态，这些状态可能无法提供有效的学习信号，导致更新过程方差高，特别是在采样转换与当前策略不匹配时问题更严重。

Method: 提出SADQ方法，使用随机转移模型显式建模环境动态，将后继状态分布整合到Q值估计过程中，实现更稳定和策略对齐的价值更新，并探索基于建模转移结构的更有效动作选择策略。

Result: 理论证明SADQ保持无偏价值估计同时减少训练方差，在标准RL基准和真实世界向量控制任务上的广泛实验表明，SADQ在稳定性和学习效率方面持续优于DQN变体。

Conclusion: SADQ通过显式建模环境动态和整合后继状态分布，有效解决了DQN中因使用过时策略状态导致的高方差问题，实现了更稳定和高效的学习。

Abstract: Deep Q-Networks (DQNs) estimate future returns by learning from transitions
sampled from a replay buffer. However, the target updates in DQN often rely on
next states generated by actions from past, potentially suboptimal, policy. As
a result, these states may not provide informative learning signals, causing
high variance into the update process. This issue is exacerbated when the
sampled transitions are poorly aligned with the agent's current policy. To
address this limitation, we propose the Successor-state Aggregation Deep
Q-Network (SADQ), which explicitly models environment dynamics using a
stochastic transition model. SADQ integrates successor-state distributions into
the Q-value estimation process, enabling more stable and policy-aligned value
updates. Additionally, it explores a more efficient action selection strategy
with the modeled transition structure. We provide theoretical guarantees that
SADQ maintains unbiased value estimates while reducing training variance. Our
extensive empirical results across standard RL benchmarks and real-world
vector-based control tasks demonstrate that SADQ consistently outperforms DQN
variants in both stability and learning efficiency.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了领先-滞后预测（LLF）这一新的预测范式，用于预测社交和协作平台中早期互动（如浏览量、点赞）与后期高影响力结果（如引用、销售）之间的时间延迟关系，并提供了arXiv和GitHub两个大规模基准数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交和协作平台中存在早期互动与后期高影响力结果之间的时间延迟关系，但LLF尚未被时间序列社区作为一个统一的预测问题来研究，主要原因是缺乏标准化数据集。

Method: 提出了领先-滞后预测（LLF）框架，收集并整理了arXiv（230万论文的访问量→引用量）和GitHub（300万仓库的推送/星标→分支）两个大规模数据集，通过统计和分类测试验证了领先-滞后动态的存在，并建立了参数和非参数回归基线模型。

Result: 创建了两个高质量基准数据集，验证了领先-滞后动态的存在，为LLF研究提供了实证基础，并建立了可复现的基线模型。

Conclusion: 该研究确立了LLF作为一个新的预测范式，为在社交和使用数据中系统探索领先-滞后预测奠定了实证基础，数据集和文档可通过数据门户网站获取。

Abstract: Social and collaborative platforms emit multivariate time-series traces in
which early interactions-such as views, likes, or downloads-are followed,
sometimes months or years later, by higher impact like citations, sales, or
reviews. We formalize this setting as Lead-Lag Forecasting (LLF): given an
early usage channel (the lead), predict a correlated but temporally shifted
outcome channel (the lag). Despite the ubiquity of such patterns, LLF has not
been treated as a unified forecasting problem within the time-series community,
largely due to the absence of standardized datasets. To anchor research in LLF,
here we present two high-volume benchmark datasets-arXiv (accesses -> citations
of 2.3M papers) and GitHub (pushes/stars -> forks of 3M repositories)-and
outline additional domains with analogous lead-lag dynamics, including
Wikipedia (page views -> edits), Spotify (streams -> concert attendance),
e-commerce (click-throughs -> purchases), and LinkedIn profile (views ->
messages). Our datasets provide ideal testbeds for lead-lag forecasting, by
capturing long-horizon dynamics across years, spanning the full spectrum of
outcomes, and avoiding survivorship bias in sampling. We documented all
technical details of data curation and cleaning, verified the presence of
lead-lag dynamics through statistical and classification tests, and benchmarked
parametric and non-parametric baselines for regression. Our study establishes
LLF as a novel forecasting paradigm and lays an empirical foundation for its
systematic exploration in social and usage data. Our data portal with downloads

### [61] [DecoHD: Decomposed Hyperdimensional Classification under Extreme Memory Budgets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03911)
*Sanggeon Yun,Hyunwoo Oh,Ryozo Masukawa,Mohsen Imani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Decomposition is a proven way to shrink deep networks without changing I/O. We bring this idea to hyperdimensional computing (HDC), where footprint cuts usually shrink the feature axis and erode concentration and robustness. Prior HDC decompositions decode via fixed atomic hypervectors, which are ill-suited for compressing learned class prototypes. We introduce DecoHD, which learns directly in a decomposed HDC parameterization: a small, shared set of per-layer channels with multiplicative binding across layers and bundling at the end, yielding a large representational space from compact factors. DecoHD compresses along the class axis via a lightweight bundling head while preserving native bind-bundle-score; training is end-to-end, and inference remains pure HDC, aligning with in/near-memory accelerators. In evaluation, DecoHD attains extreme memory savings with only minor accuracy degradation under tight deployment budgets. On average it stays within about 0.1-0.15% of a strong non-reduced HDC baseline (worst case 5.7%), is more robust to random bit-flip noise, reaches its accuracy plateau with up to ~97% fewer trainable parameters, and -- in hardware -- delivers roughly 277x/35x energy/speed gains over a CPU (AMD Ryzen 9 9950X), 13.5x/3.7x over a GPU (NVIDIA RTX 4090), and 2.0x/2.4x over a baseline HDC ASIC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将分解方法引入超维计算(HDC)，解决传统HDC压缩方法会缩小特征轴并损害集中性和鲁棒性的问题。现有的HDC分解方法使用固定的原子超向量解码，不适合压缩学习到的类别原型。

Method: 提出DecoHD方法，直接在分解的HDC参数化中学习：使用少量共享的每层通道，通过跨层乘法绑定和最终捆绑，从紧凑因子产生大的表示空间。通过轻量级捆绑头沿类别轴压缩，同时保持原生绑定-捆绑-评分操作；训练是端到端的，推理保持纯HDC，与内存/近内存加速器对齐。

Result: 在评估中，DecoHD实现了极度的内存节省，在严格部署预算下仅有轻微精度下降。平均精度保持在强非缩减HDC基线的约0.1-0.15%范围内（最差情况5.7%），对随机比特翻转噪声更鲁棒，使用多达约97%更少的可训练参数达到精度平台，在硬件上相比CPU（AMD Ryzen 9 9950X）实现约277倍/35倍的能量/速度增益，相比GPU（NVIDIA RTX 4090）实现13.5倍/3.7倍增益，相比基线HDC ASIC实现2.0倍/2.4倍增益。

Conclusion: DecoHD成功将分解方法应用于HDC，实现了显著的模型压缩和硬件效率提升，同时保持了HDC的核心优势，为资源受限环境下的HDC部署提供了有效解决方案。

Motivation: 从移动数据推断社会人口属性有助于交通规划，但由于移动模式与社会人口特征关系弱且不一致，以及跨情境泛化能力有限，这项任务仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 1) 引入基于有向移动图的高阶移动描述符；2) 开发模型置信度与准确性的均衡度量和可视化诊断工具；3) 构建多任务学习框架，从共享表示中联合预测多个社会人口属性。

Result: 该方法在预测年龄、性别、收入和家庭结构方面显著优于基线特征，多任务学习框架在训练数据有限或测试集分布与训练集不同时表现尤其出色。

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过行为基础特征、不确定性量化和多任务学习，有效解决了从移动数据推断社会人口属性的挑战，为交通规划提供了更好的工具。

Abstract: Inferring sociodemographic attributes from mobility data could help
transportation planners better leverage passively collected datasets, but this
task remains difficult due to weak and inconsistent relationships between
mobility patterns and sociodemographic traits, as well as limited
generalization across contexts. We address these challenges from three angles.
First, to improve predictive accuracy while retaining interpretability, we
introduce a behaviorally grounded set of higher-order mobility descriptors
based on directed mobility graphs. These features capture structured patterns
in trip sequences, travel modes, and social co-travel, and significantly
improve prediction of age, gender, income, and household structure over
baselines features. Second, we introduce metrics and visual diagnostic tools
that encourage evenness between model confidence and accuracy, enabling
planners to quantify uncertainty. Third, to improve generalization and sample
efficiency, we develop a multitask learning framework that jointly predicts
multiple sociodemographic attributes from a shared representation. This
approach outperforms single-task models, particularly when training data are
limited or when applying models across different time periods (i.e., when the
test set distribution differs from the training set).

Motivation: 解决在数据稀缺（收集成本高或隐私限制）情况下，如何选择高质量合成数据集用于训练的问题。

Method: 建立了首个SynQuE基准测试，提出了基于分布和多样性距离的代理指标，并针对复杂规划任务设计了LENS代理指标，利用大语言模型推理能力。

Result: SynQuE代理指标与真实任务性能相关，在情感分析、Text2SQL、网页导航和图像分类等任务上有效。LENS在复杂任务上表现最佳，如在Text2SQL解析任务中，使用SynQuE选择的前3个合成数据集可将准确率从30.4%提升至38.4%。

Conclusion: SynQuE为数据稀缺情况下的合成数据选择提供了实用框架，推动了基于基础模型的数据表征和细粒度数据选择的未来研究。

Abstract: We introduce and formalize the Synthetic Dataset Quality Estimation (SynQuE)
problem: ranking synthetic datasets by their expected real-world task
performance using only limited unannotated real data. This addresses a critical
and open challenge where data is scarce due to collection costs or privacy
constraints. We establish the first comprehensive benchmarks for this problem
by introducing and evaluating proxy metrics that choose synthetic data for
training to maximize task performance on real data. We introduce the first
proxy metrics for SynQuE by adapting distribution and diversity-based distance
measures to our context via embedding models. To address the shortcomings of
these metrics on complex planning tasks, we propose LENS, a novel proxy that
leverages large language model reasoning. Our results show that SynQuE proxies
correlate with real task performance across diverse tasks, including sentiment
analysis, Text2SQL, web navigation, and image classification, with LENS
consistently outperforming others on complex tasks by capturing nuanced
characteristics. For instance, on text-to-SQL parsing, training on the top-3
synthetic datasets selected via SynQuE proxies can raise accuracy from 30.4% to
38.4 (+8.1)% on average compared to selecting data indiscriminately. This work
establishes SynQuE as a practical framework for synthetic data selection under
real-data scarcity and motivates future research on foundation model-based data
characterization and fine-grained data selection.

Motivation: 研究高阶优化方法如何影响深度学习中的泛化性能，特别是在过参数化深度神经网络训练中随机高斯-牛顿方法的作用。

Method: 使用带Levenberg-Marquardt阻尼和mini-batch采样的随机高斯-牛顿方法，在回归设置中训练具有平滑激活函数的过参数化深度神经网络。

Result: 建立了参数空间中变量度量分析的有限时间收敛界，以及基于均匀稳定性的非渐近泛化界，发现高斯-牛顿矩阵最小特征值越大，稳定性界越紧。

Conclusion: 识别了SGN的有利泛化机制，其中优化路径上高斯-牛顿矩阵的最小特征值越大，泛化性能越好。

Abstract: An important question in deep learning is how higher-order optimization
methods affect generalization. In this work, we analyze a stochastic
Gauss-Newton (SGN) method with Levenberg-Marquardt damping and mini-batch
sampling for training overparameterized deep neural networks with smooth
activations in a regression setting. Our theoretical contributions are twofold.
First, we establish finite-time convergence bounds via a variable-metric
analysis in parameter space, with explicit dependencies on the batch size,
network width and depth. Second, we derive non-asymptotic generalization bounds
for SGN using uniform stability in the overparameterized regime, characterizing
the impact of curvature, batch size, and overparameterization on generalization
performance. Our theoretical results identify a favorable generalization regime
for SGN in which a larger minimum eigenvalue of the Gauss-Newton matrix along
the optimization path yields tighter stability bounds.

TL;DR: LogHD是一种超维计算压缩方法，通过类轴对数压缩将内存需求从O(CD)降至O(Dlog_k C)，同时保持维度D不变，在保持准确性的同时提高了鲁棒性和能效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准超维计算中每个类别一个原型的方案需要O(CD)内存，现有压缩方法主要减少特征维度D，但会削弱鲁棒性。需要一种既能减少内存占用又能保持鲁棒性的压缩方法。

Method: 使用对数类轴压缩，用n≈⌈log_k C⌉个捆绑超向量替换C个类别原型，在n维激活空间中进行解码，结合容量感知码本和基于配置文件的解码，可与特征轴稀疏化结合使用。

Result: 在各种数据集和注入比特翻转的情况下，LogHD以更小的模型实现了竞争性准确性，在相同内存下比特征轴压缩方法能承受2.5-3.0倍的比特翻转率。ASIC实现相比AMD Ryzen 9 9950X有498倍能效提升和62.6倍加速，相比NVIDIA RTX 4090有24.3倍/6.58倍优势。

Conclusion: LogHD通过类轴对数压缩有效解决了超维计算的内存效率问题，在保持准确性的同时显著提高了鲁棒性和硬件效率，为资源受限系统提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Hyperdimensional computing (HDC) suits memory, energy, and
reliability-constrained systems, yet the standard "one prototype per class"
design requires $O(CD)$ memory (with $C$ classes and dimensionality $D$). Prior
compaction reduces $D$ (feature axis), improving storage/compute but weakening
robustness. We introduce LogHD, a logarithmic class-axis reduction that
replaces the $C$ per-class prototypes with $n\!\approx\!\lceil\log_k C\rceil$
bundle hypervectors (alphabet size $k$) and decodes in an $n$-dimensional
activation space, cutting memory to $O(D\log_k C)$ while preserving $D$. LogHD
uses a capacity-aware codebook and profile-based decoding, and composes with
feature-axis sparsification. Across datasets and injected bit flips, LogHD
attains competitive accuracy with smaller models and higher resilience at
matched memory. Under equal memory, it sustains target accuracy at roughly
$2.5$-$3.0\times$ higher bit-flip rates than feature-axis compression; an ASIC
instantiation delivers $498\times$ energy efficiency and $62.6\times$ speedup
over an AMD Ryzen 9 9950X and $24.3\times$/$6.58\times$ over an NVIDIA RTX
4090, and is $4.06\times$ more energy-efficient and $2.19\times$ faster than a
feature-axis HDC ASIC baseline.

Method: TwIST采用分布式训练框架，并行训练多个子网络，定期聚合它们的参数，并在训练过程中重新采样新的子网络。这种方法能够在训练过程中识别出高质量的稀疏子网络。

Result: 在50%+的高稀疏度下，TwIST显著优于基线方法（23.14 PPL vs 31.64 PPL）。与无结构剪枝不同，TwIST生成结构化密集矩阵，在普通硬件上提供实际推理加速和内存减少。

Conclusion: TwIST提供了一种高效的训练时路径，无需额外微调或恢复开销即可获得可部署的稀疏大语言模型，在保持竞争力的困惑度同时实现零成本部署时剪枝。

Abstract: We introduce TwIST, a distributed training framework for efficient large
language model (LLM) sparsification. TwIST trains multiple subnetworks in
parallel, periodically aggregates their parameters, and resamples new
subnetworks during training. This process identifies high-quality subnetworks
("golden tickets") without requiring post-training procedures such as
calibration or Hessian-based recovery. As a result, TwIST enables zero-cost
pruning at deployment time while achieving perplexity competitive with
state-of-the-art post-training sparsification methods. The benefits are most
pronounced under aggressive sparsity (e.g., 50%+), where TwIST significantly
outperforms baseline methods; for example, reaching 23.14 PPL compared to 31.64
for the closest prior approach. Unlike unstructured pruning, TwIST produces
structured, dense matrices that offer practical inference speedups and memory
reductions on commodity hardware (e.g., CPUs) that do not support efficient
sparse computation. TwIST provides an efficient training-time path to
deployable sparse LLMs without additional fine-tuning or recovery overhead.

*Ipsita Ghosh,Ethan Nguyen,Christian Kümmerle*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Q3R（二次重加权秩正则化器），一种基于IRLS框架的低秩诱导训练策略，能够在保持低秩结构的同时实现与密集模型相当的预测性能，显著减少参数数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有参数高效训练方法在低秩预训练任务中难以同时保持低秩结构和目标性能，需要一种能够训练指定低目标秩权重矩阵的新方法。

Method: 基于IRLS框架，使用二次正则化项作为秩替代目标，通过平滑对数行列式来诱导低秩结构，与现有架构完全兼容。

Result: 在ViT-Tiny模型上，能够截断60%和80%的参数，CIFAR-10准确率仅下降约1.3%和4%；在图像和语言任务的Transformer模型上均验证了有效性。

Conclusion: Q3R是一种有效的低秩训练技术，能够在显著减少参数的同时保持模型性能，适用于低秩微调和预训练任务。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient training, based on low-rank optimization, has become a
highly successful tool for fine-tuning large deep-learning models. However,
these methods fail at low-rank pre-training tasks where maintaining the
low-rank structure and the objective remains a challenging task. We propose the
Quadratic Reweighted Rank Regularizer dubbed Q3R, which leads to a novel
low-rank inducing training strategy inspired by the iteratively reweighted
least squares (IRLS) framework. Q3R is based on a quadratic regularizer term
which majorizes a smoothed log determinant serving as rank surrogate objective.
Unlike other low-rank training techniques, Q3R is able to train weight matrices
with prescribed, low target ranks of models that achieve comparable predictive
performance as dense models, with small computational overhead, while remaining
fully compatible with existing architectures. For example, we demonstrated one
experiment where we are able to truncate $60\%$ and $80\%$ of the parameters of
a ViT-Tiny model with $~1.3\%$ and $~4\%$ accuracy drop in CIFAR-10 performance
respectively. The efficacy of Q3R is confirmed on Transformers across both
image and language tasks, including for low-rank fine-tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决马尔可夫过程中未知转移核的快速变化检测问题，特别是在高维数据场景下避免显式似然评估的困难。

Method: 直接从样本对学习条件分数∇_y log p(y|x)，基于此开发基于分数的CUSUM程序，使用条件Hyvarinen分数差异检测核变化，并提出截断版本确保有界增量。

Result: 证明了在均匀遍历马尔可夫过程中误报平均时间的指数下界，以及检测延迟的渐近上界。

Conclusion: 该方法为高维马尔可夫模型中的基于分数检测提供了理论保证和实际可行性。

Abstract: We address the problem of quickest change detection in Markov processes with
unknown transition kernels. The key idea is to learn the conditional score
$\nabla_{\mathbf{y}} \log p(\mathbf{y}|\mathbf{x})$ directly from sample pairs
$( \mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})$, where both $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ are
high-dimensional data generated by the same transition kernel. In this way, we
avoid explicit likelihood evaluation and provide a practical way to learn the
transition dynamics. Based on this estimation, we develop a score-based CUSUM
procedure that uses conditional Hyvarinen score differences to detect changes
in the kernel. To ensure bounded increments, we propose a truncated version of
the statistic. With Hoeffding's inequality for uniformly ergodic Markov
processes, we prove exponential lower bounds on the mean time to false alarm.
We also prove asymptotic upper bounds on detection delay. These results give
both theoretical guarantees and practical feasibility for score-based detection
in high-dimensional Markov models.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于强化学习的Koopman代理模型训练方法，用于非线性模型预测控制应用，并在大规模空气分离装置案例中验证了其可扩展性和性能优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的系统辨识方法在Koopman eNMPC中虽然能产生小的经济效益，但经常违反约束条件，需要一种更有效的方法来平衡经济性能和约束满足。

Method: 使用基于强化学习的方法训练Koopman代理模型，专门针对特定经济非线性模型预测控制应用进行优化，仅假设少数可实际测量的工厂变量可观测。

Result: 在大规模空气分离装置的需求响应案例中，该方法相比纯系统辨识的Koopman eNMPC，在保持相似经济性能的同时避免了约束违反。

Conclusion: 所提出的基于强化学习的Koopman代理模型训练方法具有良好的可扩展性，能够在大规模工业应用中实现经济性能与约束满足的良好平衡。

Abstract: With our recently proposed method based on reinforcement learning (Mayfrank
et al. (2024), Comput. Chem. Eng. 190), Koopman surrogate models can be trained
for optimal performance in specific (economic) nonlinear model predictive
control ((e)NMPC) applications. So far, our method has exclusively been
demonstrated on a small-scale case study. Herein, we show that our method
scales well to a more challenging demand response case study built on a
large-scale model of a single-product (nitrogen) air separation unit. Across
all numerical experiments, we assume observability of only a few realistically
measurable plant variables. Compared to a purely system identification-based
Koopman eNMPC, which generates small economic savings but frequently violates
constraints, our method delivers similar economic performance while avoiding
constraint violations.

Motivation: 随着用户对"被遗忘权"的重视，认知诊断模型需要能够删除特定学生数据，但现有模型缺乏有效的遗忘机制，通用遗忘算法难以平衡遗忘完整性、模型效用和效率。

Method: 提出分层重要性引导遗忘算法(HIF)，利用认知诊断模型参数重要性的分层特性，通过创新的平滑机制结合个体和层级重要性，精确识别与待遗忘数据相关的参数。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上的实验表明，HIF在关键指标上显著优于基线方法，提供了首个有效的认知诊断模型数据遗忘解决方案。

Conclusion: HIF为认知诊断模型响应用户数据删除请求提供了首个有效方案，支持部署高性能、保护隐私的AI系统。

Abstract: The need to remove specific student data from cognitive diagnosis (CD) models
has become a pressing requirement, driven by users' growing assertion of their
"right to be forgotten". However, existing CD models are largely designed
without privacy considerations and lack effective data unlearning mechanisms.
Directly applying general purpose unlearning algorithms is suboptimal, as they
struggle to balance unlearning completeness, model utility, and efficiency when
confronted with the unique heterogeneous structure of CD models. To address
this, our paper presents the first systematic study of the data unlearning
problem for CD models, proposing a novel and efficient algorithm: hierarchical
importanceguided forgetting (HIF). Our key insight is that parameter importance
in CD models exhibits distinct layer wise characteristics. HIF leverages this
via an innovative smoothing mechanism that combines individual and layer, level
importance, enabling a more precise distinction of parameters associated with
the data to be unlearned. Experiments on three real world datasets show that
HIF significantly outperforms baselines on key metrics, offering the first
effective solution for CD models to respond to user data removal requests and
for deploying high-performance, privacy preserving AI systems

TL;DR: PETRA是一种基于进化轨迹而非原始RNA序列的预训练变换器方法，通过系统发育树有效减轻测序噪声并捕捉病毒进化的层次结构，在预测SARS-CoV-2未来突变方面表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SARS-CoV-2具有快速且不可预测的进化轨迹，不断出现免疫逃逸变种，对公共卫生和疫苗开发构成持续挑战。现有大规模生成预训练变换器直接应用于嘈杂的病毒基因组序列存在局限性。

Method: 提出PETRA方法，基于系统发育树推导的进化轨迹而非原始RNA序列，采用加权训练框架解决全球序列数据中显著的地理和时间不平衡问题。

Result: PETRA在预测SARS-CoV-2未来突变方面表现卓越，核苷酸突变的加权recall@1达到9.45%，刺突蛋白氨基酸突变为17.10%，而最佳基线方法分别为0.49%和6.64%。该方法还能实时预测主要支系如24F(XEC)和25A(LP.8.1)的突变。

Conclusion: PETRA通过基于进化轨迹的变换器方法有效解决了病毒基因组序列中的噪声问题，在预测SARS-CoV-2突变方面显著优于现有方法，为实时监测病毒进化提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Since its emergence, SARS-CoV-2 has demonstrated a rapid and unpredictable
evolutionary trajectory, characterized by the continual emergence of
immune-evasive variants. This poses persistent challenges to public health and
vaccine development.
  While large-scale generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs) have
revolutionized the modeling of sequential data, their direct applications to
noisy viral genomic sequences are limited. In this paper, we introduce
PETRA(Pretrained Evolutionary TRAnsformer), a novel transformer approach based
on evolutionary trajectories derived from phylogenetic trees rather than raw
RNA sequences. This method effectively mitigates sequencing noise and captures
the hierarchical structure of viral evolution.
  With a weighted training framework to address substantial geographical and
temporal imbalances in global sequence data, PETRA excels in predicting future
SARS-CoV-2 mutations, achieving a weighted recall@1 of 9.45% for nucleotide
mutations and 17.10\% for spike amino-acid mutations, compared to 0.49% and
6.64% respectively for the best baseline. PETRA also demonstrates its ability
to aid in the real-time mutation prediction of major clades like 24F(XEC) and
25A(LP.8.1). The code is open sourced on https://github.com/xz-keg/PETra

Abstract: This paper proposes a composable fine-tuning method that integrates graph
structural priors with modular adapters to address the high computational cost
and structural instability faced by large-scale pre-trained models in
multi-task adaptation. The method introduces a relation matrix to model
dependencies among tasks, explicitly encoding correlations between nodes and
paths into graph structural priors, which provide unified structural
constraints for adapter weight allocation and path selection. Modular adapters
are embedded into different layers through low-rank mapping and a pluggable
mechanism, enabling efficient cross-task composition and reuse under prior
guidance. This mechanism not only improves parameter efficiency and training
stability but also alleviates path conflicts and redundant computation in
multi-task scenarios. Furthermore, experiments on hyperparameter sensitivity,
environmental sensitivity, and data sensitivity are conducted to systematically
analyze key factors such as routing temperature, gating thresholds, and
relation matrix regularization strength, verifying the consistency and superior
performance of the method under structural constraints. The results demonstrate
that the proposed framework significantly enhances task prediction accuracy,
adapter weight allocation precision, and overall computational efficiency while
maintaining model lightweight design, highlighting the synergistic advantages
of graph priors and modular mechanisms in composable fine-tuning.

Abstract: The classification of diabetes and prediabetes by static glucose thresholds
obscures the pathophysiological dysglycemia heterogeneity, primarily driven by
insulin resistance (IR), beta-cell dysfunction, and incretin deficiency. This
review demonstrates that continuous glucose monitoring and wearable
technologies enable a paradigm shift towards non-invasive, dynamic metabolic
phenotyping. We show evidence that machine learning models can leverage
high-resolution glucose data from at-home, CGM-enabled oral glucose tolerance
tests to accurately predict gold-standard measures of muscle IR and beta-cell
function. This personalized characterization extends to real-world nutrition,
where an individual's unique postprandial glycemic response (PPGR) to
standardized meals, such as the relative glucose spike to potatoes versus
grapes, could serve as a biomarker for their metabolic subtype. Moreover,
integrating wearable data reveals that habitual diet, sleep, and physical
activity patterns, particularly their timing, are uniquely associated with
specific metabolic dysfunctions, informing precision lifestyle interventions.
The efficacy of dietary mitigators in attenuating PPGR is also shown to be
phenotype-dependent. Collectively, this evidence demonstrates that CGM can
deconstruct the complexity of early dysglycemia into distinct, actionable
subphenotypes. This approach moves beyond simple glycemic control, paving the
way for targeted nutritional, behavioral, and pharmacological strategies
tailored to an individual's core metabolic defects, thereby paving the way for
a new era of precision diabetes prevention.

Abstract: Network anomaly detection systems encounter several challenges with
traditional detectors trained offline. They become susceptible to concept drift
and new threats such as zero-day or polymorphic attacks. To address this
limitation, we propose a Ca$^{2+}$-modulated learning framework that draws
inspiration from astrocytic Ca$^{2+}$ signaling in the brain, where rapid,
context-sensitive adaptation enables robust information processing. Our
approach couples a multicellular astrocyte dynamics simulator with a deep
neural network (DNN). The simulator models astrocytic Ca$^{2+}$ dynamics
through three key mechanisms: IP$_3$-mediated Ca$^{2+}$ release, SERCA pump
uptake, and conductance-aware diffusion through gap junctions between cells.
Evaluation of our proposed network on CTU-13 (Neris) network traffic data
demonstrates the effectiveness of our biologically plausible approach. The
Ca$^{2+}$-gated model outperforms a matched baseline DNN, achieving up to
$\sim$98\% accuracy with reduced false positives and negatives across multiple
train/test splits. Importantly, this improved performance comes with negligible
runtime overhead once Ca$^{2+}$ trajectories are precomputed. While
demonstrated here for cybersecurity applications, this Ca$^{2+}$-modulated
learning framework offers a generic solution for streaming detection tasks that
require rapid, biologically grounded adaptation to evolving data patterns.

Conclusion: 该框架为边缘设备上的LLM部署提供了有效的解决方案，平衡了性能、内存和通信需求。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved near-human performance across
diverse reasoning tasks, yet their deployment on resource-constrained
Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices remains impractical due to massive parameter
footprints and memory-intensive autoregressive decoding. While split computing
offers a promising solution by partitioning model execution between edge
devices and cloud servers, existing approaches fail to address the unique
challenges of autoregressive inference, particularly the iterative token
generation process and expanding key-value (KV) cache requirements. This work
introduces the first autoregressive-aware split computing framework designed
explicitly for LLM deployment on edge devices. Our approach makes three key
contributions. First, we develop one-point split compression (OPSC), a
mixed-precision quantization scheme that prevents out-of-memory failures by
strategically partitioning models into front-end and back-end segments with
different precision levels. Second, we propose a two-stage intermediate
compression pipeline that combines threshold splitting (TS) and token-wise
adaptive bit quantization (TAB-Q) to preserve accuracy-critical activations
while dramatically reducing communication overhead. Third, we formulate a
unified optimization framework that jointly selects optimal split points,
quantization settings, and sequence lengths to satisfy strict memory and
latency constraints. Extensive evaluations across diverse LLMs and hardware
platforms demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art
quantization methods, including SmoothQuant, OmniQuant, and Atom. The framework
achieves a 1.49 inference speedup and significant communication overhead
reduction while maintaining or improving model accuracy.

Conclusion: DSRPGO通过动态选择和重构预训练机制有效解决了多模态蛋白质功能预测的挑战，为蛋白质功能分析提供了有力工具

Abstract: Multimodal protein features play a crucial role in protein function
prediction. However, these features encompass a wide range of information,
ranging from structural data and sequence features to protein attributes and
interaction networks, making it challenging to decipher their complex
interconnections. In this work, we propose a multimodal protein function
prediction method (DSRPGO) by utilizing dynamic selection and reconstructive
pre-training mechanisms. To acquire complex protein information, we introduce
reconstructive pre-training to mine more fine-grained information with low
semantic levels. Moreover, we put forward the Bidirectional Interaction Module
(BInM) to facilitate interactive learning among multimodal features.
Additionally, to address the difficulty of hierarchical multi-label
classification in this task, a Dynamic Selection Module (DSM) is designed to
select the feature representation that is most conducive to current protein
function prediction. Our proposed DSRPGO model improves significantly in BPO,
MFO, and CCO on human datasets, thereby outperforming other benchmark models.

Conclusion: DartQuant使大语言模型量化在资源受限环境中变得可行，为大规模模型部署提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Quantization plays a crucial role in accelerating the inference of
large-scale models, and rotational matrices have been shown to effectively
improve quantization performance by smoothing outliers. However, end-to-end
fine-tuning of rotational optimization algorithms incurs high computational
costs and is prone to overfitting. To address this challenge, we propose an
efficient distribution-aware rotational calibration method, DartQuant, which
reduces the complexity of rotational optimization by constraining the
distribution of the activations after rotation. This approach also effectively
reduces reliance on task-specific losses, thereby mitigating the risk of
overfitting. Additionally, we introduce the QR-Orth optimization scheme, which
replaces expensive alternating optimization with a more efficient solution. In
a variety of model quantization experiments, DartQuant demonstrates superior
performance. Compared to existing methods, it achieves 47$\times$ acceleration
and 10$\times$ memory savings for rotational optimization on a 70B model.
Furthermore, it is the first to successfully complete rotational calibration
for a 70B model on a single 3090 GPU, making quantization of large language
models feasible in resource-constrained environments. Code is available at

Abstract: Pediatric appendicitis remains one of the most common causes of acute
abdominal pain in children, and its diagnosis continues to challenge clinicians
due to overlapping symptoms and variable imaging quality. This study aims to
develop and evaluate a deep learning model based on a pretrained ResNet
architecture for automated detection of appendicitis from ultrasound images. We
used the Regensburg Pediatric Appendicitis Dataset, which includes ultrasound
scans, laboratory data, and clinical scores from pediatric patients admitted
with abdominal pain to Children Hospital. Hedwig in Regensburg, Germany. Each
subject had 1 to 15 ultrasound views covering the right lower quadrant,
appendix, lymph nodes, and related structures. For the image based
classification task, ResNet was fine tuned to distinguish appendicitis from
non-appendicitis cases. Images were preprocessed by normalization, resizing,
and augmentation to enhance generalization. The proposed ResNet model achieved
an overall accuracy of 93.44, precision of 91.53, and recall of 89.8,
demonstrating strong performance in identifying appendicitis across
heterogeneous ultrasound views. The model effectively learned discriminative
spatial features, overcoming challenges posed by low contrast, speckle noise,
and anatomical variability in pediatric imaging.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of the left atrium (LA) from cardiac MRI is critical
for guiding atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation and constructing biophysical
cardiac models. Manual delineation is time-consuming, observer-dependent, and
impractical for large-scale or time-sensitive clinical workflows. Deep learning
methods, particularly convolutional architectures, have recently demonstrated
superior performance in medical image segmentation tasks. In this study, we
applied the nnU-Net framework, an automated, self-configuring deep learning
segmentation architecture, to the Left Atrial Segmentation Challenge 2013
dataset. The dataset consists of thirty MRI scans with corresponding
expert-annotated masks. The nnU-Net model automatically adapted its
preprocessing, network configuration, and training pipeline to the
characteristics of the MRI data. Model performance was quantitatively evaluated
using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), and qualitative results were
compared against expert segmentations. The proposed nnU?Net model achieved a
mean Dice score of 93.5, demonstrating high overlap with expert annotations and
outperforming several traditional segmentation approaches reported in previous
studies. The network exhibited robust generalization across variations in left
atrial shape, contrast, and image quality, accurately delineating both the
atrial body and proximal pulmonary veins.

TL;DR: 提出了一种学习最优权衡向量距离和过滤器匹配的方法，替代固定惩罚机制，通过约束线性优化学习权重，显著提升过滤近似最近邻搜索的准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于图的方法使用固定、数据无关的惩罚机制，无法在具有不同标签和向量分布的数据集上泛化

Method: 将问题建模为约束线性优化问题，直接从数据中学习向量距离和过滤器匹配之间的最优权衡权重，这些权重指导搜索过程和索引构建

Result: 实验表明，与固定惩罚方法相比，该方法将准确率提高了5-10%

Conclusion: 通过适应数据学习距离函数，为过滤ANN搜索问题提供了更灵活和可泛化的框架

Abstract: Filtered Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search retrieves the closest
vectors for a query vector from a dataset. It enforces that a specified set of
discrete labels $S$ for the query must be included in the labels of each
retrieved vector. Existing graph-based methods typically incorporate filter
awareness by assigning fixed penalties or prioritizing nodes based on filter
satisfaction. However, since these methods use fixed, data in- dependent
penalties, they often fail to generalize across datasets with diverse label and
vector distributions. In this work, we propose a principled alternative that
learns the optimal trade-off between vector distance and filter match directly
from the data, rather than relying on fixed penalties. We formulate this as a
constrained linear optimization problem, deriving weights that better reflect
the underlying filter distribution and more effectively address the filtered
ANN search problem. These learned weights guide both the search process and
index construction, leading to graph structures that more effectively capture
the underlying filter distribution and filter semantics. Our experiments
demonstrate that adapting the distance function to the data significantly im-
proves accuracy by 5-10% over fixed-penalty methods, providing a more flexible
and generalizable framework for the filtered ANN search problem.

*Qingfeng Chen,Haojin Zeng,Jingyi Jie,Shichao Zhang,Debo Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DeNoise是一个针对训练数据被污染的图级异常检测框架，通过对抗性目标联合优化图编码器、属性解码器和结构解码器，学习抗噪声嵌入，并在真实数据集上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图神经网络方法通常假设训练集是干净的，只包含正常图，但实际中训练数据往往会被异常图污染，这会扭曲学习到的表示并严重降低性能。

Method: 提出DeNoise框架：1）联合优化图级编码器、属性解码器和结构解码器；2）引入编码器锚点对齐去噪机制，将正常图的高信息节点嵌入融合到所有图嵌入中；3）使用对比学习组件在潜在空间中压缩正常图嵌入并排斥异常图嵌入。

Result: 在8个真实世界数据集上的广泛实验表明，DeNoise在不同噪声强度下都能学习到可靠的图级表示，并显著优于最先进的UGAD基线方法。

Conclusion: DeNoise能够有效处理训练数据被污染的情况，为图级异常检测提供了一种鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: With the rapid growth of graph-structured data in critical domains,
unsupervised graph-level anomaly detection (UGAD) has become a pivotal task.
UGAD seeks to identify entire graphs that deviate from normal behavioral
patterns. However, most Graph Neural Network (GNN) approaches implicitly assume
that the training set is clean, containing only normal graphs, which is rarely
true in practice. Even modest contamination by anomalous graphs can distort
learned representations and sharply degrade performance. To address this
challenge, we propose DeNoise, a robust UGAD framework explicitly designed for
contaminated training data. It jointly optimizes a graph-level encoder, an
attribute decoder, and a structure decoder via an adversarial objective to
learn noise-resistant embeddings. Further, DeNoise introduces an encoder
anchor-alignment denoising mechanism that fuses high-information node
embeddings from normal graphs into all graph embeddings, improving
representation quality while suppressing anomaly interference. A contrastive
learning component then compacts normal graph embeddings and repels anomalous
ones in the latent space. Extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets
demonstrate that DeNoise consistently learns reliable graph-level
representations under varying noise intensities and significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art UGAD baselines.

Motivation: 为韩国企业避税研究提供标准化的长期面板数据，既能与国际文献保持一致，又能反映韩国特有的制度特征，如股权集中、外资持股高、流动性比率高等。

Method: 构建包含12,653个企业年度观测值的平衡面板数据集，使用现金有效税率(CETR)、GAAP有效税率(GETR)和账面税差异(TSTA、TSDA)等互补指标衡量避税，并与盈余管理、盈利能力、稳定性、增长性和公司治理等多个领域变量关联。

Conclusion: KoTaP是一个重要的开放资源，支持计量经济学和深度学习模型基准测试、外部有效性检验、可解释AI分析，以及政策评估、审计规划和投资分析等应用。

Abstract: This study introduces the Korean Tax Avoidance Panel (KoTaP), a long-term
panel dataset of non-financial firms listed on KOSPI and KOSDAQ between 2011
and 2024. After excluding financial firms, firms with non-December fiscal year
ends, capital impairment, and negative pre-tax income, the final dataset
consists of 12,653 firm-year observations from 1,754 firms. KoTaP is designed
to treat corporate tax avoidance as a predictor variable and link it to
multiple domains, including earnings management (accrual- and activity-based),
profitability (ROA, ROE, CFO, LOSS), stability (LEV, CUR, SIZE, PPE, AGE,
INVREC), growth (GRW, MB, TQ), and governance (BIG4, FORN, OWN). Tax avoidance
itself is measured using complementary indicators cash effective tax rate
(CETR), GAAP effective tax rate (GETR), and book-tax difference measures (TSTA,
TSDA) with adjustments to ensure interpretability. A key strength of KoTaP is
its balanced panel structure with standardized variables and its consistency
with international literature on the distribution and correlation of core
indicators. At the same time, it reflects distinctive institutional features of
Korean firms, such as concentrated ownership, high foreign shareholding, and
elevated liquidity ratios, providing both international comparability and
contextual uniqueness. KoTaP enables applications in benchmarking econometric
and deep learning models, external validity checks, and explainable AI
analyses. It further supports policy evaluation, audit planning, and investment
analysis, making it a critical open resource for accounting, finance, and
interdisciplinary research.

Conclusion: 该方法能有效生成可解释的多元数学表达式，在保持准确性的同时更好地发现数据背后的控制方程。

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) models complex systems by discovering mathematical
expressions that capture underlying relationships in observed data. However,
most SR methods prioritize minimizing prediction error over identifying the
governing equations, often producing overly complex or inaccurate expressions.
To address this, we present a decomposable SR method that generates
interpretable multivariate expressions leveraging transformer models, genetic
algorithms (GAs), and genetic programming (GP). In particular, our explainable
SR method distills a trained ``opaque'' regression model into mathematical
expressions that serve as explanations of its computed function. Our method
employs a Multi-Set Transformer to generate multiple univariate symbolic
skeletons that characterize how each variable influences the opaque model's
response. We then evaluate the generated skeletons' performance using a
GA-based approach to select a subset of high-quality candidates before
incrementally merging them via a GP-based cascade procedure that preserves
their original skeleton structure. The final multivariate skeletons undergo
coefficient optimization via a GA. We evaluated our method on problems with
controlled and varying degrees of noise, demonstrating lower or comparable
interpolation and extrapolation errors compared to two GP-based methods, three
neural SR methods, and a hybrid approach. Unlike them, our approach
consistently learned expressions that matched the original mathematical
structure.

Motivation: LLM技术在各领域展现优势，但作为端到端编译器的潜力尚未充分探索。编译器作为关键系统软件，研究LLM作为编译器的可行性具有重要意义。

Method: 设计CompilerEval数据集和框架，评估主流LLM在源代码理解和汇编代码生成方面的能力，分析各类错误，探索多种改进方法并评估跨平台编译能力。

Result: LLMs展现出作为编译器的基本能力，但当前编译成功率较低。通过提示优化、模型扩展和推理方法，可显著提升生成的汇编代码质量。

Conclusion: 对LaaC持乐观态度，提出实用架构设计和未来研究方向。通过针对性训练、知识丰富的提示和专用基础设施，LaaC有望生成高质量汇编代码并推动编译领域范式转变。

Abstract: In recent years, end-to-end Large Language Model (LLM) technology has shown
substantial advantages across various domains. As critical system software and
infrastructure, compilers are responsible for transforming source code into
target code. While LLMs have been leveraged to assist in compiler development
and maintenance, their potential as an end-to-end compiler remains largely
unexplored. This paper explores the feasibility of LLM as a Compiler (LaaC) and
its future directions. We designed the CompilerEval dataset and framework
specifically to evaluate the capabilities of mainstream LLMs in source code
comprehension and assembly code generation. In the evaluation, we analyzed
various errors, explored multiple methods to improve LLM-generated code, and
evaluated cross-platform compilation capabilities. Experimental results
demonstrate that LLMs exhibit basic capabilities as compilers but currently
achieve low compilation success rates. By optimizing prompts, scaling up the
model, and incorporating reasoning methods, the quality of assembly code
generated by LLMs can be significantly enhanced. Based on these findings, we
maintain an optimistic outlook for LaaC and propose practical architectural
designs and future research directions. We believe that with targeted training,
knowledge-rich prompts, and specialized infrastructure, LaaC has the potential
to generate high-quality assembly code and drive a paradigm shift in the field
of compilation.

Motivation: 实际应用中安全强化学习常涉及无限数量约束（半无限安全RL），如需要在连续参数空间上强制执行安全条件（如确保每个空间位置的资源分配充足），现有方法难以处理此类问题。

Method: EPO通过迭代求解有限约束集的安全RL子问题，采用约束扩展和删除机制自适应调整活动集：违反预定义容差的约束被添加以细化策略，拉格朗日乘子为零的约束在策略更新后被移除。

Result: 理论分析表明，在温和假设下，通过EPO训练的策略实现了与最优解相当的性能，且全局约束违反严格保持在预定界限内。

Conclusion: EPO框架有效解决了半无限安全RL问题，通过可控的工作集增长和有效的策略训练，实现了最优性能和有界安全约束。

Abstract: Safe reinforcement learning (safe RL) aims to respect safety requirements
while optimizing long-term performance. In many practical applications,
however, the problem involves an infinite number of constraints, known as
semi-infinite safe RL (SI-safe RL). Such constraints typically appear when
safety conditions must be enforced across an entire continuous parameter space,
such as ensuring adequate resource distribution at every spatial location. In
this paper, we propose exchange policy optimization (EPO), an algorithmic
framework that achieves optimal policy performance and deterministic bounded
safety. EPO works by iteratively solving safe RL subproblems with finite
constraint sets and adaptively adjusting the active set through constraint
expansion and deletion. At each iteration, constraints with violations
exceeding the predefined tolerance are added to refine the policy, while those
with zero Lagrange multipliers are removed after the policy update. This
exchange rule prevents uncontrolled growth of the working set and supports
effective policy training. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that, under
mild assumptions, strategies trained via EPO achieve performance comparable to
optimal solutions with global constraint violations strictly remaining within a
prescribed bound.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多二级和区域机场面临严重的数据稀缺问题，这限制了机器学习方法的应用和大规模模拟分析能力，需要解决数据稀缺环境下的轨迹生成问题。

Method: 采用最先进的扩散模型和流匹配架构，先在苏黎世机场进行预训练，然后在都柏林机场使用不同比例数据（0%-100%）进行微调，评估模型在机场间的可迁移性。

Result: 扩散模型仅需5%都柏林数据即可达到竞争性能，20%达到基准水平，始终优于从头训练的模型；潜流匹配和潜扩散模型也从预训练中受益，但流匹配模型泛化能力较弱。

Conclusion: 迁移学习能显著降低ATM中轨迹生成的数据需求，即使在历史记录有限的环境中也能实现现实的合成数据生成。

Abstract: Access to trajectory data is a key requirement for developing and validating
Air Traffic Management (ATM) solutions, yet many secondary and regional
airports face severe data scarcity. This limits the applicability of machine
learning methods and the ability to perform large-scale simulations or
"what-if" analyses. In this paper, we investigate whether generative models
trained on data-rich airports can be efficiently adapted to data-scarce
airports using transfer learning. We adapt state-of-the-art diffusion- and
flow-matching-based architectures to the aviation domain and evaluate their
transferability between Zurich (source) and Dublin (target) landing trajectory
datasets. Models are pretrained on Zurich and fine-tuned on Dublin with varying
amounts of local data, ranging from 0% to 100%. Results show that
diffusion-based models achieve competitive performance with as little as 5% of
the Dublin data and reach baseline-level performance around 20%, consistently
outperforming models trained from scratch across metrics and visual
inspections. Latent flow matching and latent diffusion models also benefit from
pretraining, though with more variable gains, while flow matching models show
weaker generalization. Despite challenges in capturing rare trajectory
patterns, these findings demonstrate the potential of transfer learning to
substantially reduce data requirements for trajectory generation in ATM,
enabling realistic synthetic data generation even in environments with limited
historical records.

Abstract: This study proposes a Transformer-based longitudinal modeling method to
address challenges in clinical risk classification with heterogeneous
Electronic Health Record (EHR) data, including irregular temporal patterns,
large modality differences, and complex semantic structures. The method takes
multi-source medical features as input and employs a feature embedding layer to
achieve a unified representation of structured and unstructured data. A
learnable temporal encoding mechanism is introduced to capture dynamic
evolution under uneven sampling intervals. The core model adopts a multi-head
self-attention structure to perform global dependency modeling on longitudinal
sequences, enabling the aggregation of long-term trends and short-term
fluctuations across different temporal scales. To enhance semantic
representation, a semantic-weighted pooling module is designed to assign
adaptive importance to key medical events, improving the discriminative ability
of risk-related features. Finally, a linear mapping layer generates
individual-level risk scores. Experimental results show that the proposed model
outperforms traditional machine learning and temporal deep learning models in
accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-Score, achieving stable and precise risk
identification in multi-source heterogeneous EHR environments and providing an
efficient and reliable framework for clinical intelligent decision-making.

Abstract: Deep ensembles are a powerful tool in machine learning, improving both model
performance and uncertainty calibration. While ensembles are typically formed
by training and tuning models individually, evidence suggests that jointly
tuning the ensemble can lead to better performance. This paper investigates the
impact of jointly tuning weight decay, temperature scaling, and early stopping
on both predictive performance and uncertainty quantification. Additionally, we
propose a partially overlapping holdout strategy as a practical compromise
between enabling joint evaluation and maximizing the use of data for training.
Our results demonstrate that jointly tuning the ensemble generally matches or
improves performance, with significant variation in effect size across
different tasks and metrics. We highlight the trade-offs between individual and
joint optimization in deep ensemble training, with the overlapping holdout
strategy offering an attractive practical solution. We believe our findings
provide valuable insights and guidance for practitioners looking to optimize
deep ensemble models. Code is available at:

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) form the cornerstone of modern AI services,
supporting a wide range of applications, including autonomous driving,
chatbots, and recommendation systems. As models increase in size and
complexity, DNN workloads like training and inference tasks impose
unprecedented demands on distributed computing resources, making the accurate
prediction of runtime essential for optimizing development and resource
allocation. Traditional methods rely on additive computational unit models,
limiting their accuracy and generalizability. In contrast, graph-enhanced
modeling improves performance but significantly increases data collection
costs. Therefore, there is a critical need for a method that strikes a balance
between accuracy, generalizability, and the costs of data collection. To
address these challenges, we propose ScaleDL, a novel runtime prediction
framework that combines nonlinear layer-wise modeling with graph neural network
(GNN)-based cross-layer interaction mechanism, enabling accurate DNN runtime
prediction and hierarchical generalizability across different network
architectures. Additionally, we employ the D-optimal method to reduce data
collection costs. Experiments on the workloads of five popular DNN models prove
that ScaleDL enhances runtime prediction accuracy and generalizability,
achieving 6$\times$ lower MRE and 5$\times$ lower RMSE compared to baseline
models.

While most existing methods are designed for INT4 formats, the emergence of
MXFP4 -- a new FP4 format with various hardware support (NVIDIA, AMD, Intel)--
raises questions about the applicability of current techniques. In this work,
we establish a comprehensive benchmark of PTQ methods under the MXFP4 format.
Through systematic evaluation, we find that methods like GPTQ consistently
deliver strong performance, whereas rotation-based approaches, which are almost
used by all state-of-the-art approaches, suffer from severe incompatibility
with MXFP4. We further provide the first in-depth analysis of this conflict,
tracing its root to a fundamental mismatch between MXFP4's PoT (power-of-two)
block scaling and the redistribution of outlier energy via global rotation.
Building on this insight, we propose a simple yet effective block rotation
strategy that adapts rotation-based methods to MXFP4, leading to substantial
accuracy improvements across diverse LLMs. Our findings not only offer clear
guidance for practitioners but also set a foundation for advancing PTQ research
under emerging low-precision formats.

TL;DR: 本文证明了强彩票票假设在多头注意力机制和Transformer架构中的存在性，通过理论分析表明在随机初始化的网络中隐藏着高性能子网络。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前强彩票票假设的理论研究尚未涵盖Transformer架构中的多头注意力机制，这是Transformer的核心组件，因此需要填补这一理论空白。

Method: 通过理论分析证明，在随机初始化的多头注意力网络中，当键和值的隐藏维度为O(dlog(Hd^{3/2}))时，存在能够近似任意目标多头注意力的强彩票票。

Result: 理论证明和实验验证表明，通过增加源模型的隐藏维度，源模型中的强彩票票与目标对应物之间的近似误差呈指数级下降。

Conclusion: 研究成功将强彩票票假设扩展到多头注意力机制和无归一化层的Transformer架构，为Transformer网络的理论理解提供了重要支撑。

Abstract: The strong lottery ticket hypothesis (SLTH) conjectures that high-performing
subnetworks, called strong lottery tickets (SLTs), are hidden in randomly
initialized neural networks. Although recent theoretical studies have
established the SLTH across various neural architectures, the SLTH for
transformer architectures still lacks theoretical understanding. In particular,
the current theory of the SLTH does not yet account for the multi-head
attention (MHA) mechanism, a core component of transformers. To address this
gap, we introduce a theoretical analysis of the existence of SLTs within MHAs.
We prove that, if a randomly initialized MHA of $H$ heads and input dimension
$d$ has the hidden dimension $O(d\log(Hd^{3/2}))$ for the key and value, it
contains an SLT that approximates an arbitrary MHA with the same input
dimension with high probability. Furthermore, by leveraging this theory for
MHAs, we extend the SLTH to transformers without normalization layers. We
empirically validate our theoretical findings, demonstrating that the
approximation error between the SLT within a source model (MHA and transformer)
and an approximate target counterpart decreases exponentially by increasing the
hidden dimension of the source model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的生物序列设计方法缺乏统一的评估指标软件库，需要开发一个模块化、可扩展的工具来标准化评估过程。

Method: 开发seqme库，包含序列基础、嵌入基础和属性基础三类模型无关的评估指标，提供嵌入模型、属性模型以及诊断和可视化功能。

Result: 成功创建了seqme库，支持多种生物序列类型（小分子、DNA、ncRNA、mRNA、肽和蛋白质），能够评估一次性设计和迭代设计方法。

Conclusion: seqme填补了生物序列设计评估工具的空缺，为研究人员提供了标准化、可扩展的评估框架。

Abstract: Recent advances in computational methods for designing biological sequences
have sparked the development of metrics to evaluate these methods performance
in terms of the fidelity of the designed sequences to a target distribution and
their attainment of desired properties. However, a single software library
implementing these metrics was lacking. In this work we introduce seqme, a
modular and highly extendable open-source Python library, containing
model-agnostic metrics for evaluating computational methods for biological
sequence design. seqme considers three groups of metrics: sequence-based,
embedding-based, and property-based, and is applicable to a wide range of
biological sequences: small molecules, DNA, ncRNA, mRNA, peptides and proteins.
The library offers a number of embedding and property models for biological
sequences, as well as diagnostics and visualization functions to inspect the
results. seqme can be used to evaluate both one-shot and iterative
computational design methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列分类在安全关键应用中很重要，但通常使用黑盒深度学习方法，难以理解其输出原理。需要一种既能准确分类又能提供可解释性的方法。

Method: 提出STELLE框架，引入STL启发的核函数将原始时间序列映射到与预定义STL公式的对齐程度。模型联合优化准确性和可解释性，每个预测都伴随最相关的逻辑概念。

Result: 实验表明STELLE在多样化真实世界基准测试中实现了有竞争力的准确率，同时提供逻辑可信的解释。

Conclusion: STELLE成功地将分类和解释统一在神经符号框架中，为时间序列分类提供了既准确又可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Time series classification is a task of paramount importance, as this kind of
data often arises in safety-critical applications. However, it is typically
tackled with black-box deep learning methods, making it hard for humans to
understand the rationale behind their output. To take on this challenge, we
propose a novel approach, STELLE (Signal Temporal logic Embedding for
Logically-grounded Learning and Explanation), a neuro-symbolic framework that
unifies classification and explanation through direct embedding of trajectories
into a space of temporal logic concepts. By introducing a novel STL-inspired
kernel that maps raw time series to their alignment with predefined STL
formulae, our model jointly optimises accuracy and interpretability, as each
prediction is accompanied by the most relevant logical concepts that
characterise it. This yields (i) local explanations as human-readable STL
conditions justifying individual predictions, and (ii) global explanations as
class-characterising formulae. Experiments demonstrate that STELLE achieves
competitive accuracy while providing logically faithful explanations, validated
on diverse real-world benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从人类偏好中学习是使机器学习模型与主观人类判断对齐的关键，但收集偏好数据成本高昂且耗时，需要更高效的学习范式。

Method: 在RLHF流程中集成主动查询模块，结合RLHF的可扩展性和PBO的样本效率优势。

Result: 在高维偏好优化和LLM微调两个代表性领域的实验结果显示，该方法在样本效率和整体性能上均获得一致提升。

Conclusion: 所提出的混合框架成功统一了RLHF的可扩展性和PBO的查询效率，为高效偏好学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Learning from human preferences is a cornerstone of aligning machine learning
models with subjective human judgments. Yet, collecting such preference data is
often costly and time-consuming, motivating the need for more efficient
learning paradigms. Two established approaches offer complementary advantages:
RLHF scales effectively to high-dimensional tasks such as LLM fine-tuning,
while PBO achieves greater sample efficiency through active querying. We
propose a hybrid framework that unifies RLHF's scalability with PBO's query
efficiency by integrating an acquisition-driven module into the RLHF pipeline,
thereby enabling active and sample-efficient preference gathering. We validate
the proposed approach on two representative domains: (i) high-dimensional
preference optimization and (ii) LLM fine-tuning. Experimental results
demonstrate consistent improvements in both sample efficiency and overall
performance across these tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的差分隐私上下文学习方法忽略了现代大语言模型流程中的关键组件——用于检索相关上下文数据的相似性搜索，这带来了隐私风险。

Method: 采用最近邻检索从上下文数据库中获取相关数据，结合隐私过滤器跟踪选定样本的累积隐私成本，确保符合中心差分隐私预算。

Result: 在所有评估基准测试中，该方法都显著优于现有基线，实现了更好的隐私-效用权衡。

Conclusion: 提出的差分隐私上下文学习框架通过集成隐私感知的最近邻搜索，有效解决了现有方法忽略相似性搜索隐私风险的问题，在多个任务上表现出色。

Abstract: Differentially private in-context learning (DP-ICL) has recently become an
active research topic due to the inherent privacy risks of in-context learning.
However, existing approaches overlook a critical component of modern large
language model (LLM) pipelines: the similarity search used to retrieve relevant
context data. In this work, we introduce a DP framework for in-context learning
that integrates nearest neighbor search of relevant examples in a privacy-aware
manner. Our method outperforms existing baselines by a substantial margin
across all evaluated benchmarks, achieving more favorable privacy-utility
trade-offs. To achieve this, we employ nearest neighbor retrieval from a
database of context data, combined with a privacy filter that tracks the
cumulative privacy cost of selected samples to ensure adherence to a central
differential privacy budget. Experimental results on text classification and
document question answering show a clear advantage of the proposed method over
existing baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有处理临床纵向数据缺失值的方法主要来自静态贝叶斯网络，未能充分考虑数据的时间特性，限制了时间维度不确定性的量化能力，这在重症监护等需要理解时间动态的临床环境中尤为重要。

Method: 使用吉布斯采样方法学习动态贝叶斯网络，将每个缺失值视为服从高斯分布的未知参数，在每次迭代中从未观测值的完全条件分布中采样，实现有原则的插补和不确定性估计。

Result: 在模拟数据集和真实重症监护患者数据上的评估表明，相比MICE等标准模型无关技术，该贝叶斯方法展现出更优的重建精度和收敛特性。

Conclusion: 该方法强调了在时间模型中整合完全贝叶斯推断的临床相关性，提供更可靠的插补结果和更深入理解模型行为，支持在缺失数据频繁且影响重大的临床环境中进行更安全、更明智的决策。

Abstract: Dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) are increasingly used in healthcare due to
their ability to model complex temporal relationships in patient data while
maintaining interpretability, an essential feature for clinical
decision-making. However, existing approaches to handling missing data in
longitudinal clinical datasets are largely derived from static Bayesian
networks literature, failing to properly account for the temporal nature of the
data. This gap limits the ability to quantify uncertainty over time, which is
particularly critical in settings such as intensive care, where understanding
the temporal dynamics is fundamental for model trustworthiness and
applicability across diverse patient groups. Despite the potential of DBNs, a
full Bayesian framework that integrates missing data handling remains
underdeveloped. In this work, we propose a novel Gibbs sampling-based method
for learning DBNs from incomplete data. Our method treats each missing value as
an unknown parameter following a Gaussian distribution. At each iteration, the
unobserved values are sampled from their full conditional distributions,
allowing for principled imputation and uncertainty estimation. We evaluate our
method on both simulated datasets and real-world intensive care data from
critically ill patients. Compared to standard model-agnostic techniques such as
MICE, our Bayesian approach demonstrates superior reconstruction accuracy and
convergence properties. These results highlight the clinical relevance of
incorporating full Bayesian inference in temporal models, providing more
reliable imputations and offering deeper insight into model behavior. Our
approach supports safer and more informed clinical decision-making,
particularly in settings where missing data are frequent and potentially
impactful.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型容易依赖虚假相关性，在分布偏移特别是子群体偏移场景下表现不佳，现有方法缺乏连接嵌入空间表示与最差群体误差的理论框架

Method: SCER方法直接在嵌入层面对特征表示进行正则化，通过识别跨域和跨类别的群体均值嵌入差异来区分核心特征和虚假特征方向，施加理论约束使模型关注核心特征

Result: 在多个视觉和语言任务上的系统评估表明，SCER在最差群体准确率上优于现有最先进方法

Conclusion: SCER提供了一种理论驱动的嵌入正则化方法，能有效提升模型在最差群体上的鲁棒性，减少对虚假相关性的依赖

Abstract: Deep learning models achieve strong performance across various domains but
often rely on spurious correlations, making them vulnerable to distribution
shifts. This issue is particularly severe in subpopulation shift scenarios,
where models struggle in underrepresented groups. While existing methods have
made progress in mitigating this issue, their performance gains are still
constrained. They lack a rigorous theoretical framework connecting the
embedding space representations with worst-group error. To address this
limitation, we propose Spurious Correlation-Aware Embedding Regularization for
Worst-Group Robustness (SCER), a novel approach that directly regularizes
feature representations to suppress spurious cues. We show theoretically that
worst-group error is influenced by how strongly the classifier relies on
spurious versus core directions, identified from differences in group-wise mean
embeddings across domains and classes. By imposing theoretical constraints at
the embedding level, SCER encourages models to focus on core features while
reducing sensitivity to spurious patterns. Through systematic evaluation on
multiple vision and language, we show that SCER outperforms prior
state-of-the-art studies in worst-group accuracy. Our code is available at

Motivation: 现实语言具有内在歧义性，但现有UQ方法通常在无歧义任务上进行基准测试，无法反映真实部署场景中的不确定性量化需求。

Method: 引入MAQA*和AmbigQA*数据集，配备基于事实共现估计的真实答案分布；评估了三种不确定性估计范式：预测分布、内部表示和模型集成。

Result: 发现所有不确定性估计方法在歧义数据上性能都显著下降至接近随机水平，且这种现象可以通过理论解释。

Conclusion: 预测分布和集成基估计器在歧义情况下存在根本性限制，需要重新思考当前建模范式。

Abstract: Accurate uncertainty quantification (UQ) in Large Language Models (LLMs) is
critical for trustworthy deployment. While real-world language is inherently
ambiguous, reflecting aleatoric uncertainty, existing UQ methods are typically
benchmarked against tasks with no ambiguity. In this work, we demonstrate that
while current uncertainty estimators perform well under the restrictive
assumption of no ambiguity, they degrade to close-to-random performance on
ambiguous data. To this end, we introduce MAQA* and AmbigQA*, the first
ambiguous question-answering (QA) datasets equipped with ground-truth answer
distributions estimated from factual co-occurrence. We find this performance
deterioration to be consistent across different estimation paradigms: using the
predictive distribution itself, internal representations throughout the model,
and an ensemble of models. We show that this phenomenon can be theoretically
explained, revealing that predictive-distribution and ensemble-based estimators
are fundamentally limited under ambiguity. Overall, our study reveals a key
shortcoming of current UQ methods for LLMs and motivates a rethinking of
current modeling paradigms.

Motivation: 回归与分类之间的形式化联系一直很薄弱，即使支持向量回归中使用了边界最大化项，其合理性最多被解释为正则化。本文旨在建立两者之间的严格等价关系。

Method: 通过证明回归问题与分类问题的等价性，将M个样本的回归任务映射为2M个样本的线性可分分类任务，并基于边界最大化推导出新的回归公式。

Result: 提出了"可回归性"度量方法，可以在不先学习模型的情况下估计数据集的回归难度；还训练神经网络学习线性化映射，将输入变量转换到线性回归器足够适用的空间。

Conclusion: 建立了回归与分类之间的形式化等价关系，为回归问题提供了新的理论基础和实用工具，包括可回归性度量和线性化映射方法。

Abstract: A formal link between regression and classification has been tenuous. Even
though the margin maximization term $\|w\|$ is used in support vector
regression, it has at best been justified as a regularizer. We show that a
regression problem with $M$ samples lying on a hyperplane has a one-to-one
equivalence with a linearly separable classification task with $2M$ samples. We
show that margin maximization on the equivalent classification task leads to a
different regression formulation than traditionally used. Using the
equivalence, we demonstrate a ``regressability'' measure, that can be used to
estimate the difficulty of regressing a dataset, without needing to first learn
a model for it. We use the equivalence to train neural networks to learn a
linearizing map, that transforms input variables into a space where a linear
regressor is adequate.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在短期预测中表现不佳，且通常忽略分类特征，需要一种更通用的时间序列预测方法。

Method: 使用三个集成模块：分解模块提取季节性和趋势成分；模型选择模块根据预测跨度选择最优神经网络配置；对抗训练模块通过条件生成对抗网络增强预测鲁棒性。

Result: 在11个基准多元时间序列数据集上验证，ForecastGAN在短期预测中持续优于最先进的transformer模型，在长期预测中保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 该研究建立了一种更通用的时间序列预测方法，能够适应特定场景，在不同数据特征下保持强性能，无需大量超参数调优。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is essential across domains from finance to supply
chain management. This paper introduces ForecastGAN, a novel decomposition
based adversarial framework addressing limitations in existing approaches for
multi-horizon predictions. Although transformer models excel in long-term
forecasting, they often underperform in short-term scenarios and typically
ignore categorical features. ForecastGAN operates through three integrated
modules: a Decomposition Module that extracts seasonality and trend components;
a Model Selection Module that identifies optimal neural network configurations
based on forecasting horizon; and an Adversarial Training Module that enhances
prediction robustness through Conditional Generative Adversarial Network
training. Unlike conventional approaches, ForecastGAN effectively integrates
both numerical and categorical features. We validate our framework on eleven
benchmark multivariate time series datasets that span various forecasting
horizons. The results show that ForecastGAN consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art transformer models for short-term forecasting while remaining
competitive for long-term horizons. This research establishes a more
generalizable approach to time series forecasting that adapts to specific
contexts while maintaining strong performance across diverse data
characteristics without extensive hyperparameter tuning.

Result: 理论上证明了两种算法都能达到$O({1}/{(TNp)^{rac{s-1}{2s}}})$的收敛速率。实验进一步验证了算法的有效性。

Conclusion: 据我们所知，这些是首个在重尾噪声下具有严格理论保证的联邦极小极大优化算法。

Abstract: Heavy-tailed noise has attracted growing attention in nonconvex stochastic
optimization, as numerous empirical studies suggest it offers a more realistic
assumption than standard bounded variance assumption. In this work, we
investigate nonconvex-PL minimax optimization under heavy-tailed gradient noise
in federated learning. We propose two novel algorithms: Fed-NSGDA-M, which
integrates normalized gradients, and FedMuon-DA, which leverages the Muon
optimizer for local updates. Both algorithms are designed to effectively
address heavy-tailed noise in federated minimax optimization, under a milder
condition. We theoretically establish that both algorithms achieve a
convergence rate of $O({1}/{(TNp)^{\frac{s-1}{2s}}})$. To the best of our
knowledge, these are the first federated minimax optimization algorithms with
rigorous theoretical guarantees under heavy-tailed noise. Extensive experiments
further validate their effectiveness.

Abstract: Retrieval of information from graph-structured knowledge bases represents a
promising direction for improving the factuality of LLMs. While various

lack of challenging QA datasets with ground-truth targets for graph retrieval.
We present SynthKGQA, a framework for generating high-quality synthetic
Knowledge Graph Question Answering datasets from any Knowledge Graph, providing
the full set of ground-truth facts in the KG to reason over each question. We
show how, in addition to enabling more informative benchmarking of KG
retrievers, the data produced with SynthKGQA also allows us to train better
models. We apply SynthKGQA to Wikidata to generate GTSQA, a new dataset
designed to test zero-shot generalization abilities of KG retrievers with

Abstract: Market generators using deep generative models have shown promise for
synthetic financial data generation, but existing approaches lack causal
reasoning capabilities essential for counterfactual analysis and risk
assessment. We propose a Time-series Neural Causal Model VAE (TNCM-VAE) that
combines variational autoencoders with structural causal models to generate
counterfactual financial time series while preserving both temporal
dependencies and causal relationships. Our approach enforces causal constraints
through directed acyclic graphs in the decoder architecture and employs the
causal Wasserstein distance for training. We validate our method on synthetic
autoregressive models inspired by the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, demonstrating
superior performance in counterfactual probability estimation with L1 distances
as low as 0.03-0.10 compared to ground truth. The model enables financial
stress testing, scenario analysis, and enhanced backtesting by generating
plausible counterfactual market trajectories that respect underlying causal
mechanisms.

Motivation: 算法公平性研究快速发展，但在刑事司法等关键领域，核心概念仍存在争议，特别是不同公平性概念之间的冲突问题需要解决。

Method: 开发了一种标准群体公平性的简单修改方法：不要求受保护群体间的完全平等，而是在小容忍度内保持假阴性率差异的同时最小化加权错误损失。

Result: 该方法使解决方案更容易找到，可以提高预测准确性，并突显错误成本选择的伦理考量。

Conclusion: 提出了基于三个支柱的实用部署框架：基于需求的决策、透明度和问责制、以及精确定义和解决方案，将技术设计与合法性联系起来，为使用风险评估工具的机构提供可操作指导。

Abstract: Algorithmic fairness has grown rapidly as a research area, yet key concepts
remain unsettled, especially in criminal justice. We review group, individual,
and process fairness and map the conditions under which they conflict. We then
develop a simple modification to standard group fairness. Rather than exact
parity across protected groups, we minimize a weighted error loss while keeping
differences in false negative rates within a small tolerance. This makes
solutions easier to find, can raise predictive accuracy, and surfaces the
ethical choice of error costs. We situate this proposal within three classes of
critique: biased and incomplete data, latent affirmative action, and the
explosion of subgroup constraints. Finally, we offer a practical framework for
deployment in public decision systems built on three pillars: need-based
decisions, Transparency and accountability, and narrowly tailored definitions
and solutions. Together, these elements link technical design to legitimacy and
provide actionable guidance for agencies that use risk assessment and related
tools.

Conclusion: RGP为关系深度学习提供了一个通用且可扩展的解决方案，支持多样化的预测任务。

Abstract: In domains such as healthcare, finance, and e-commerce, the temporal dynamics
of relational data emerge from complex interactions-such as those between
patients and providers, or users and products across diverse categories. To be
broadly useful, models operating on these data must integrate long-range
spatial and temporal dependencies across diverse types of entities, while also
supporting multiple predictive tasks. However, existing graph models for
relational data primarily focus on spatial structure, treating temporal
information merely as a filtering constraint to exclude future events rather
than a modeling signal, and are typically designed for single-task prediction.
To address these gaps, we introduce a temporal subgraph sampler that enhances
global context by retrieving nodes beyond the immediate neighborhood to capture
temporally relevant relationships. In addition, we propose the Relational Graph
Perceiver (RGP), a graph transformer architecture for relational deep learning
that leverages a cross-attention-based latent bottleneck to efficiently
integrate information from both structural and temporal contexts. This latent
bottleneck integrates signals from different node and edge types into a common
latent space, enabling the model to build global context across the entire
relational system. RGP also incorporates a flexible cross-attention decoder
that supports joint learning across tasks with disjoint label spaces within a
single model. Experiments on RelBench, SALT, and CTU show that RGP delivers
state-of-the-art performance, offering a general and scalable solution for
relational deep learning with support for diverse predictive tasks.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于数据信息的神经网络压缩方法，通过最小化函数空间误差而非传统的权重空间误差，使用协方差矩阵优化张量分解，无需微调即可达到竞争性精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络压缩通常需要大量计算资源，传统方法在权重空间寻找低秩近似，但这种方法忽略了数据分布对压缩效果的影响。

Method: 使用数据信息范数最小化层输出分布的变化，提出新的交替最小二乘算法用于Tucker-2和CPD张量分解，直接优化基于协方差的范数。

Result: 在多个CNN架构和数据集上的实验表明，该方法无需微调即可达到竞争性精度，且协方差范数可在数据集间迁移。

Conclusion: 数据信息的压缩方法优于传统权重空间方法，能够有效压缩神经网络而保持精度，且具有数据集迁移能力。

Abstract: Neural networks are widely used for image-related tasks but typically demand
considerable computing power. Once a network has been trained, however, its
memory- and compute-footprint can be reduced by compression. In this work, we
focus on compression through tensorization and low-rank representations.
Whereas classical approaches search for a low-rank approximation by minimizing
an isotropic norm such as the Frobenius norm in weight-space, we use
data-informed norms that measure the error in function space. Concretely, we
minimize the change in the layer's output distribution, which can be expressed
as $\lVert (W - \widetilde{W}) \Sigma^{1/2}\rVert_F$ where $\Sigma^{1/2}$ is
the square root of the covariance matrix of the layer's input and $W$,
$\widetilde{W}$ are the original and compressed weights. We propose new
alternating least square algorithms for the two most common tensor
decompositions (Tucker-2 and CPD) that directly optimize the new norm. Unlike
conventional compression pipelines, which almost always require
post-compression fine-tuning, our data-informed approach often achieves
competitive accuracy without any fine-tuning. We further show that the same
covariance-based norm can be transferred from one dataset to another with only
a minor accuracy drop, enabling compression even when the original training
dataset is unavailable. Experiments on several CNN architectures (ResNet-18/50,
and GoogLeNet) and datasets (ImageNet, FGVC-Aircraft, Cifar10, and Cifar100)
confirm the advantages of the proposed method.

Motivation: 研究动机是验证因果干预是否会导致模型内部表示偏离自然分布，以及这种偏离是否影响解释的忠实性。

Method: 首先实证验证常见因果干预技术确实会导致分布偏移，然后理论分析无害和有害两种分歧类型，最后改进CL损失函数来正则化干预。

Result: 实证结果表明常见因果干预确实会偏离自然分布；理论分析区分了权重零空间内的无害分歧和激活隐藏网络通路的有害分歧；改进的CL损失能有效减轻有害分歧。

Conclusion: 研究结果为开发更可靠的可解释性方法指明了方向，通过正则化干预来减少有害分歧，同时保持干预的解释能力。

Abstract: A common approach to mechanistic interpretability is to causally manipulate
model representations via targeted interventions in order to understand what
those representations encode. Here we ask whether such interventions create
out-of-distribution (divergent) representations, and whether this raises
concerns about how faithful their resulting explanations are to the target
model in its natural state. First, we demonstrate empirically that common
causal intervention techniques often do shift internal representations away
from the natural distribution of the target model. Then, we provide a
theoretical analysis of two classes of such divergences: `harmless' divergences
that occur in the null-space of the weights and from covariance within
behavioral decision boundaries, and `pernicious' divergences that activate
hidden network pathways and cause dormant behavioral changes. Finally, in an
effort to mitigate the pernicious cases, we modify the Counterfactual Latent
(CL) loss from Grant (2025) that regularizes interventions to remain closer to
the natural distributions, reducing the likelihood of harmful divergences while
preserving the interpretive power of interventions. Together, these results
highlight a path towards more reliable interpretability methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LMC在数据偏移情况下的表现，理解数据偏移如何影响模型收敛到相同局部最小值或不同区域，以及这些区域在平滑性和泛化能力方面的差异。

Method: 将数据偏移解释为随机梯度噪声的额外来源，通过调整学习率和批量大小来减轻其影响，实验研究LMC在不同数据条件下的表现。

Result: 小学习率和大批量大小可以减少数据偏移的影响，使模型更可能收敛到相同局部最小值；通过LMC采样的模型倾向于产生更相似的错误，但LMC在训练效率和多样化集成之间提供了平衡。

Conclusion: LMC在数据偏移下仍然有效，通过适当的超参数设置可以减轻数据偏移的影响，LMC有助于在保持训练效率的同时获得多样化的模型集成。

Abstract: The phenomenon of linear mode connectivity (LMC) links several aspects of
deep learning, including training stability under noisy stochastic gradients,
the smoothness and generalization of local minima (basins), the similarity and
functional diversity of sampled models, and architectural effects on data
processing. In this work, we experimentally study LMC under data shifts and
identify conditions that mitigate their impact. We interpret data shifts as an
additional source of stochastic gradient noise, which can be reduced through
small learning rates and large batch sizes. These parameters influence whether
models converge to the same local minimum or to regions of the loss landscape
with varying smoothness and generalization. Although models sampled via LMC
tend to make similar errors more frequently than those converging to different
basins, the benefit of LMC lies in balancing training efficiency against the
gains achieved from larger, more diverse ensembles. Code and supplementary
materials will be made publicly available at https://github.com/DLR-KI/LMC in
due course.

Motivation: 开发更精确的数值方法来求解二维波动方程，特别是比较新型的基于特征变种的B-EPGP方法与传统的CN-FEM方法。

Method: B-EPGP利用从特征变种导出的指数多项式基来精确执行PDE和边界条件，并使用惩罚最小二乘法估计系数；CN-FEM采用经典有限元法结合Crank-Nicolson时间步进；引入自由度匹配协议确保公平比较。

Result: 在匹配自由度条件下，B-EPGP始终获得比CN-FEM更低的时空L^2误差和最大时间空间L^2误差，精度提高约两个数量级。

Conclusion: B-EPGP方法在求解二维波动方程时显著优于传统的CN-FEM方法，特别是在精度方面表现出明显优势。

Abstract: We present a new benchmarking study comparing a boundary-constrained
Ehrenpreis--Palamodov Gaussian Process (B-EPGP) surrogate with a classical
finite element method combined with Crank--Nicolson time stepping (CN-FEM) for
solving the two-dimensional wave equation with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary
conditions. The B-EPGP construction leverages exponential-polynomial bases
derived from the characteristic variety to enforce the PDE and boundary
conditions exactly and employs penalized least squares to estimate the
coefficients. To ensure fairness across paradigms, we introduce a
degrees-of-freedom (DoF) matching protocol. Under matched DoF, B-EPGP
consistently attains lower space-time $L^2$-error and maximum-in-time
$L^{2}$-error in space than CN-FEM, improving accuracy by roughly two orders of
magnitude.

Abstract: Reduced-order models (ROMs) can efficiently simulate high-dimensional
physical systems, but lack robust uncertainty quantification methods. Existing
approaches are frequently architecture- or training-specific, which limits
flexibility and generalization. We introduce a post hoc, model-agnostic
framework for predictive uncertainty quantification in latent space ROMs that
requires no modification to the underlying architecture or training procedure.
Using conformal prediction, our approach estimates statistical prediction
intervals for multiple components of the ROM pipeline: latent dynamics,
reconstruction, and end-to-end predictions. We demonstrate the method on a
latent space dynamical model for cloud microphysics, where it accurately
predicts the evolution of droplet-size distributions and quantifies uncertainty
across the ROM pipeline.

Conclusion: ARETE能快速获取未开发的物种出现数据，改变需要此类数据的项目工作流程，让研究人员能更好地分配资源，在项目规划中预测可用文献数据。

Abstract: 1. A hard stop for the implementation of rigorous conservation initiatives is
our lack of key species data, especially occurrence data. Furthermore,
researchers have to contend with an accelerated speed at which new information
must be collected and processed due to anthropogenic activity. Publications
ranging from scientific papers to gray literature contain this crucial
information but their data are often not machine-readable, requiring extensive
human work to be retrieved. 2. We present the ARETE R package, an open-source
software aiming to automate data extraction of species occurrences powered by
large language models, namely using the chatGPT Application Programming
Interface. This R package integrates all steps of the data extraction and
validation process, from Optical Character Recognition to detection of outliers
and output in tabular format. Furthermore, we validate ARETE through systematic
comparison between what is modelled and the work of human annotators. 3. We
demonstrate the usefulness of the approach by comparing range maps produced
using GBIF data and with those automatically extracted for 100 species of
spiders. Newly extracted data allowed to expand the known Extent of Occurrence
by a mean three orders of magnitude, revealing new areas where the species were
found in the past, which mayhave important implications for spatial
conservation planning and extinction risk assessments. 4. ARETE allows faster
access to hitherto untapped occurrence data, a potential game changer in
projects requiring such data. Researchers will be able to better prioritize
resources, manually verifying selected species while maintaining automated
extraction for the majority. This workflow also allows predicting available
bibliographic data during project planning.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We introduce Complexity as Advantage (CAA), a framework that defines the
complexity of a system relative to a family of observers. Instead of measuring
complexity as an intrinsic property, we evaluate how much predictive regret a
system induces for different observers attempting to model it. A system is
complex when it is easy for some observers and hard for others, creating an
information advantage. We show that this formulation unifies several notions of
emergent behavior, including multiscale entropy, predictive information, and
observer-dependent structure. The framework suggests that "interesting" systems
are those positioned to create differentiated regret across observers,
providing a quantitative grounding for why complexity can be functionally
valuable. We demonstrate the idea through simple dynamical models and discuss
implications for learning, evolution, and artificial agents.

Conclusion: 这些见解阐明了去中心化控制的学习复杂性，可为多智能体系统中高效学习算法的设计提供指导。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) are central to applications such as swarm robotics
and traffic routing, where agents must coordinate in a decentralized manner to
achieve a common objective. Stochastic Shortest Path (SSP) problems provide a
natural framework for modeling decentralized control in such settings. While
the problem of learning in SSP has been extensively studied in single-agent
settings, the decentralized multi-agent variant remains largely unexplored. In
this work, we take a step towards addressing that gap. We study decentralized
multi-agent SSPs (Dec-MASSPs) under linear function approximation, where the
transition dynamics and costs are represented using linear models. Applying
novel symmetry-based arguments, we identify the structure of optimal policies.
Our main contribution is the first regret lower bound for this setting based on
the construction of hard-to-learn instances for any number of agents, $n$. Our
regret lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{K})$, over $K$ episodes, highlights the
inherent learning difficulty in Dec-MASSPs. These insights clarify the learning
complexity of decentralized control and can further guide the design of
efficient learning algorithms in multi-agent systems.

Result: 智能体在平均目标成功率方面有所提升并趋于稳定，但单个目标的性能存在不稳定性。训练后的智能体能够被指示寻找环境中的任何观察结果。

Conclusion: 该方法能够实现通用智能体的预训练，为特定用例提供基础，支持智能体自主学习和任务解决。

Abstract: In this paper we study how transforming regular reinforcement learning
environments into goal-conditioned environments can let agents learn to solve
tasks autonomously and reward-free. We show that an agent can learn to solve
tasks by selecting its own goals in an environment-agnostic way, at training
times comparable to externally guided reinforcement learning. Our method is
independent of the underlying off-policy learning algorithm. Since our method
is environment-agnostic, the agent does not value any goals higher than others,
leading to instability in performance for individual goals. However, in our
experiments, we show that the average goal success rate improves and
stabilizes. An agent trained with this method can be instructed to seek any
observations made in the environment, enabling generic training of agents prior
to specific use cases.

progressive distillation, adversarial diffusion distillation, Wasserstein GANs

Motivation: 标准自回归大语言模型的推理过程本质上是顺序的，导致推理时间长且成本高。扩散语言模型（如MDM）能够并行采样，但缺乏对其并行采样能力如何影响采样性能的严格理解。

Method: 通过建立与单变量函数逼近理论的优雅联系，精确刻画了任何分布和任何解掩码调度下真实分布与采样分布之间的期望差异。利用信息论性质（总相关性和双总相关性）推导新的上下界和采样调度。

Result: 发现没有强先验知识通常无法达到最优解掩码调度，但基于总相关性和双总相关性的新上界表明，在某些自然设置下，可以在O(log n)步内采样而不会出现明显性能损失。

Conclusion: 扩散语言模型在特定条件下可以实现高效的并行采样，为加速大语言模型推理提供了理论基础和实用方法。

Abstract: A major bottleneck of standard auto-regressive large language models is that
their inference process is inherently sequential, resulting in very long and
costly inference times. To circumvent this, practitioners proposed a class of
language models called diffusion language models, of which the masked diffusion
model (MDM) is the most successful. The MDM is able to sample tokens
out-of-order and, ostensibly, many tokens at once and in parallel. However,
there is very limited rigorous understanding of how much parallel sampling
these models can perform without noticeable degradation in their sampling
performance. Prior work of Li and Cai obtained some preliminary bounds, but
these are not tight for many natural classes of distributions. In this work, we
give a new, exact characterization of the expected divergence between the true
distribution and the sampled distribution, for any distribution and any
unmasking schedule for the sampler, showing an elegant connection to the theory
of univariate function approximation.
  By leveraging this connection, we then attain a number of novel lower and
upper bounds for this problem. While the connection to function approximation
in principle gives the optimal unmasking schedule for any distribution, we show
that it is in general impossible to compete with it without strong a priori
knowledge of the distribution, even in seemingly benign settings. However, we
also demonstrate new upper bounds and new sampling schedules in terms of
well-studied information-theoretic properties of the base distribution, namely,
its total correlation and dual total correlation, which show that in some
natural settings, one can sample in $O(log n)$ steps without any visible loss
in performance, where $n$ is the total sequence length.

Conclusion: 自适应模型剪枝能有效解决无线联邦学习中的通信开销问题，在保证性能的同时显著降低通信成本。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) offers new opportunities in machine learning,
particularly in addressing data privacy concerns. In contrast to conventional
event-based federated learning, time-triggered federated learning (TT-Fed), as
a general form of both asynchronous and synchronous FL, clusters users into
different tiers based on fixed time intervals. However, the FL network consists
of a growing number of user devices with limited wireless bandwidth,
consequently magnifying issues such as stragglers and communication overhead.
In this paper, we introduce adaptive model pruning to wireless TT-Fed systems
and study the problem of jointly optimizing the pruning ratio and bandwidth
allocation to minimize the training loss while ensuring minimal learning
latency. To answer this question, we perform convergence analysis on the
gradient l_2 norm of the TT-Fed model based on model pruning. Based on the
obtained convergence upper bound, a joint optimization problem of pruning ratio
and wireless bandwidth is formulated to minimize the model training loss under
a given delay threshold. Then, we derive closed-form solutions for wireless
bandwidth and pruning ratio using Karush-Kuhn-Tucker(KKT) conditions. The
simulation results show that model pruning could reduce the communication cost
by 40% while maintaining the model performance at the same level.

Conclusion: 通过恢复具有物理一致性的完整3D动力学，为极端降水的熟练可靠临近预报提供了可扩展且稳健的途径。

Abstract: Extreme precipitation nowcasting demands high spatiotemporal fidelity and
extended lead times, yet existing approaches remain limited. Numerical Weather
Prediction (NWP) and its deep-learning emulations are too slow and coarse for
rapidly evolving convection, while extrapolation and purely data-driven models
suffer from error accumulation and excessive smoothing. Hybrid 2D radar-based
methods discard crucial vertical information, preventing accurate
reconstruction of height-dependent dynamics. We introduce a gray-box, fully
three-dimensional nowcasting framework that directly processes volumetric radar
reflectivity and couples physically constrained neural operators with
datadriven learning. The model learns vertically varying 3D advection fields
under a conservative advection operator, parameterizes spatially varying
diffusion, and introduces a Brownian-motion--inspired stochastic term to
represent unresolved motions. A residual branch captures small-scale convective
initiation and microphysical variability, while a diffusion-based stochastic
module estimates uncertainty. The framework achieves more accurate forecasts up
to three-hour lead time across precipitation regimes and ranked first in 57\%
of cases in a blind evaluation by 160 meteorologists. By restoring full 3D
dynamics with physical consistency, it offers a scalable and robust pathway for
skillful and reliable nowcasting of extreme precipitation.

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in developing general learning algorithms is their
tendency to forget past knowledge when adapting to new data. Addressing this
problem requires a principled understanding of forgetting; yet, despite decades
of study, no unified definition has emerged that provides insights into the
underlying dynamics of learning. We propose an algorithm- and task-agnostic
theory that characterises forgetting as a lack of self-consistency in a
learner's predictive distribution over future experiences, manifesting as a
loss of predictive information. Our theory naturally yields a general measure
of an algorithm's propensity to forget. To validate the theory, we design a
comprehensive set of experiments that span classification, regression,
generative modelling, and reinforcement learning. We empirically demonstrate
how forgetting is present across all learning settings and plays a significant
role in determining learning efficiency. Together, these results establish a
principled understanding of forgetting and lay the foundation for analysing and
improving the information retention capabilities of general learning
algorithms.

Abstract: This study evaluates a 40-item mathematics placement examination administered
to 198 students using a multi-method framework combining Classical Test Theory,
machine learning, and unsupervised clustering. Classical Test Theory analysis
reveals that 55\% of items achieve excellent discrimination ($D \geq 0.40$)
while 30\% demonstrate poor discrimination ($D < 0.20$) requiring replacement.
Question 6 (Graph Interpretation) emerges as the examination's most powerful
discriminator, achieving perfect discrimination ($D = 1.000$), highest ANOVA
F-statistic ($F = 4609.1$), and maximum Random Forest feature importance
(0.206), accounting for 20.6\% of predictive power. Machine learning algorithms
demonstrate exceptional performance, with Random Forest and Gradient Boosting
achieving 97.5\% and 96.0\% cross-validation accuracy. K-means clustering
identifies a natural binary competency structure with a boundary at 42.5\%,
diverging from the institutional threshold of 55\% and suggesting potential
overclassification into remedial categories. The two-cluster solution exhibits
exceptional stability (bootstrap ARI = 0.855) with perfect lower-cluster
purity. Convergent evidence across methods supports specific refinements:
replace poorly discriminating items, implement a two-stage assessment, and
integrate Random Forest predictions with transparency mechanisms. These
findings demonstrate that multi-method integration provides a robust empirical
foundation for evidence-based mathematics placement optimization.
