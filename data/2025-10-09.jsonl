This transparency also opens a promising\ndirection: multiple reasoners can directly collaborate on each other's thinking\nwithin a shared trajectory, yielding better inference efficiency and\nexploration. A key prerequisite, however, is the ability to assess the\nusefulness and build on another model's partial thinking -- we call this\noff-trajectory reasoning. Our paper investigates a critical question: can\nstandard solo-reasoning training pipelines deliver desired off-trajectory\nbehaviors? We propose twin tests that capture the two extremes of the\noff-trajectory spectrum, namely Recoverability, which tests whether LLMs can\nbacktrack from \"distractions\" induced by misleading reasoning traces, and\nGuidability, which tests their ability to build upon correct reasoning from\nstronger collaborators. Our study evaluates 15 open-weight LLMs (1.5B-32B) and\nreveals a counterintuitive finding -- \"stronger\" LLMs on benchmarks are often\nmore fragile under distraction. Moreover, all models tested fail to effectively\nleverage guiding steps from collaborators on problems beyond their inherent\ncapabilities with solve rates remaining under 9.2%. Finally, we conduct control\nstudies to isolate the effects of three factors in post-training on these\nbehaviors: the choice of distillation teacher, the use of RL, and data\nselection strategy. Our results provide actionable insights for training\nnatively strong reasoning collaborators; e.g., we find that suboptimal\nrecoverability behaviors of teacher models are transferred to distilled\nstudents even if the distillation trajectories are correct.

We further demonstrate that in the\nunderparameterized regime, representations learned with noisy labels are more\ninformative than those learned with clean labels, while in the\noverparameterized regime, these representations are equally informative. Our\nresults indicate that the representations of overparameterized networks are\nrobust to label noise.

While many studies have demonstrated\nperformance benefits of combining multiple model predictions, existing\nstrategies using linear pooling methods (ranging from simple averaging to\ndynamic weight updates) face a key limitation.

While many studies have demonstrated\nperformance benefits of combining multiple model predictions, existing\nstrategies using linear pooling methods (ranging from simple averaging to\ndynamic weight updates) face a key limitation. Dynamic prediction combinations\nthat rely on historical performance to update weights are necessarily reactive.\nDue to the need to average over a reasonable number of epochs (with moving\naverages or exponential weighting), they tend to be slow to adjust to changing\ncircumstances (phase or regime changes). In this work, we develop a model that\nuses machine learning to forecast the performance of predictions by models at\neach epoch in a time series. This enables `context-awareness' by assigning\nhigher weight to models that are likely to be more accurate at a given time. We\nshow that adding a performance forecasting worker in a decentralized learning\nnetwork, following a design similar to the Allora network, can improve the\naccuracy of network inferences. Specifically, we find forecasting models that\npredict regret (performance relative to the network inference) or regret\nz-score (performance relative to other workers) show greater improvement than\nmodels predicting losses, which often do not outperform the naive network\ninference (historically weighted average of all inferences). Through a series\nof optimization tests, we show that the performance of the forecasting model\ncan be sensitive to choices in the feature set and number of training epochs.\nThese properties may depend on the exact problem and should be tailored to each\ndomain.

Zaremba\net al.

However, this benefit of test compute fades when attackers are\ngiven access to gradients or multimodal inputs. We address this gap, clarifying\nthat inference-compute offers benefits even in such cases. Our approach argues\nthat compositional generalization, through which OOD data is understandable via\nits in-distribution (ID) components, enables adherence to defensive\nspecifications on adversarially OOD inputs. Namely, we posit the Robustness\nfrom Inference Compute Hypothesis (RICH): inference-compute defenses profit as\nthe model's training data better reflects the attacked data's components. We\nempirically support this hypothesis across vision language model and attack\ntypes, finding robustness gains from test-time compute if specification\nfollowing on OOD data is unlocked by compositional generalization, while RL\nfinetuning and protracted reasoning are not critical. For example, increasing\nemphasis on defensive specifications via prompting lowers the success rate of\ngradient-based multimodal attacks on VLMs robustified by adversarial\npretraining, but this same intervention provides no such benefit to\nnot-robustified models. This correlation of inference-compute's robustness\nbenefit with base model robustness is the rich-get-richer dynamic of the RICH:\nattacked data components are more ID for robustified models, aiding\ncompositional generalization to OOD data.

We\ncomprehensively evaluate both zero-shot sub-resolution and super-resolution\n(i.e., multi-resolution) inference in MLOs. We decouple multi-resolution\ninference into two key behaviors: 1) extrapolation to varying frequency\ninformation; and 2) interpolating across varying resolutions. We empirically\ndemonstrate that MLOs fail to do both of these tasks in a zero-shot manner.\nConsequently, we find MLOs are not able to perform accurate inference at\nresolutions different from those on which they were trained, and instead they\nare brittle and susceptible to aliasing.

In the first stage, asymmetric weight perturbations from\nrandom initialization sustain non-degenerate gradient dynamics in parameter\nmatrices, facilitating systematic escape from small initialization regimes.\nSubsequently, these matrices undergo condensation, progressively aligning\ntoward the target orientation. In the second stage, the previously static\nkey-query matrices actively participate in training, driving the normalized\nmatrices toward asymptotic rank collapse. This two-stage framework generalizes\nclassical directional convergence results."}

In this paper we show that the core insight to address this\nquestion stems from recasting Thompson Sampling as an online optimization\nalgorithm. To distill this, a key conceptual tool is introduced, which we refer\nto as \"faithful\" stationarization of the regret formulation. Essentially, the\nfinite horizon dynamic optimization problem is converted into a stationary\ncounterpart which \"closely resembles\" the original objective (in contrast, the\nclassical infinite horizon discounted formulation, that leads to the Gittins\nindex, alters the problem and objective in too significant a manner).

Yet, unlike learning, where generalization and out of\ndistribution (OoD) evaluation concepts are well formalized, there is no clear,\nconsistent definition or metric for reasoning ability. We propose Complexity\nOut of Distribution (Complexity OoD) generalization as a framework and problem\nsetting to define and measure reasoning. A model exhibits Complexity OoD\ngeneralization when it maintains performance on test instances whose minimal\nrequired solution complexity, either representational (richer solution\nstructure) or computational (more reasoning steps/program length), exceeds that\nof all training examples. We formalize complexity via solution description\nKolmogorov complexity and operational proxies (e.g., object/relation counts;\nreasoning step counts), clarifying how Complexity OoD differs from length and\ncompositional OoD. This lens unifies learning and reasoning: many cases\nsolvable with System1 like processing at low complexity become System2 like\nunder complexity pressure, while System2 can be viewed as generalization over\nsolution structures. We translate this perspective into practice with\nrecommendations for operationalizing Complexity OoD across the stack:\nincorporating complexity into benchmark and evaluation metric design,\nrethinking supervision to target solution traces, seeking and designing\ninductive biases for Complexity OoD generalization, addressing learning to\nreason spillovers such as spurious shortcuts, semantic robustness, catastrophic\nforgetting, and step wise calibration. Because Complexity OoD cannot be solved\nby scaling data alone, progress toward robust reasoning will require\narchitectures and training regimes that explicitly model and allocate\ncomputation with respect to complexity."}

To solve novel problems, agents should acquire skills for\nexploring and learning through experience. Finding a scalable learning\nmechanism for developing agents that learn through interaction remains a major\nopen problem. In this work, we introduce BuilderBench, a benchmark to\naccelerate research into agent pre-training that centers open-ended\nexploration. BuilderBench requires agents to learn how to build any structure\nusing blocks. BuilderBench is equipped with $(1)$ a hardware accelerated\nsimulator of a robotic agent interacting with various physical blocks, and\n$(2)$ a task-suite with over 42 diverse target structures that are carefully\ncurated to test an understanding of physics, mathematics, and long-horizon\nplanning. During training, agents have to explore and learn general principles\nabout the environment without any external supervision. During evaluation,\nagents have to build the unseen target structures from the task suite. Solving\nthese tasks requires a sort of \\emph{embodied reasoning} that is not reflected\nin words but rather in actions, experimenting with different strategies and\npiecing them together. Our experiments show that many of these tasks challenge\nthe current iteration of algorithms. Hence, we also provide a ``training\nwheels'' protocol, in which agents are trained and evaluated to build a single\ntarget structure from the task suite. Finally, we provide single-file\nimplementations of six different algorithms as a reference point for\nresearchers."}

This paradigm introduces\nunique challenges for LLMs' reasoning and agentic capabilities when interacting\nwith retrieval systems and the broader web. In this paper, we propose a\nreasoning-driven LLM-based pipeline to study effective reasoning behavior\npatterns in agentic search. Using this pipeline, we analyze successful agentic\nsearch trajectories and identify four beneficial reasoning behaviors:\nInformation Verification, Authority Evaluation, Adaptive Search, and Error\nRecovery. Based on these findings, we propose a technique called Behavior\nPriming to train more effective agentic search models. It synthesizes agentic\nsearch trajectories that exhibit these four behaviors and integrates them into\nthe agentic search model through supervised fine-tuning (SFT), followed by\nstandard reinforcement learning (RL). Experiments on three benchmarks (GAIA,\nWebWalker, and HLE) demonstrate that behavior priming yields over 35% gains in\nLlama3.2-3B and Qwen3-1.7B compared to directly training agentic search models\nwith RL. Crucially, we demonstrate that the desired reasoning behaviors in the\nSFT data, rather than the correctness of the final answer, is the critical\nfactor for achieving strong final performance after RL: fine-tuning on\ntrajectories with desirable reasoning behaviors but incorrect answers leads to\nbetter performance than fine-tuning on trajectories with correct answers. Our\nanalysis further reveals the underlying mechanism: the introduced reasoning\nbehaviors endow models with more effective exploration (higher pass@k and\nentropy) and test-time scaling (longer trajectories) capabilities, providing a\nstrong foundation for RL. Our code will be released as open source."}

APE\nincorporates a confidence-based ensemble mechanism to decide when to adopt the\njudgments from additional evaluation dimensions through a novel confidence\nestimation approach called Collective Confidence. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that APE improves the reliability of LLM Judge across diverse\nstandard benchmarks.

In\nthis paper, we examine three key challenges in a common class of meta-agents.\nFirst, we investigate how a meta-agent learns across iterations and find that\nsimply expanding the context with all previous agents, as proposed by previous\nworks, performs worse than ignoring prior designs entirely. We show that the\nperformance improves with an evolutionary approach. Second, although the\nmeta-agent designs multiple agents during training, it typically commits to a\nsingle agent at test time. We find that the designed agents have low behavioral\ndiversity, limiting the potential for their complementary use. Third, we assess\nwhen automated design is economically viable. We find that only in a few\ncases--specifically, two datasets--the overall cost of designing and deploying\nthe agents is lower than that of human-designed agents when deployed on over\n15,000 examples. In contrast, the performance gains for other datasets do not\njustify the design cost, regardless of scale."}

Meanwhile, biological\norganisms survive, thrive, and care for each other in an open-ended physical\nworld with relative ease and efficiency. Understanding the role of the\nconditions of life in this disparity can aid in developing more robust,\nadaptive, and caring artificial agents. Here we define two minimal conditions\nfor physical embodiment inspired by the existentialist phenomenology of Martin\nHeidegger: being-in-the-world (the agent is a part of the environment) and\nbeing-towards-death (unless counteracted, the agent drifts toward terminal\nstates due to the second law of thermodynamics). We propose that from these\nconditions we can obtain both a homeostatic drive - aimed at maintaining\nintegrity and avoiding death by expending energy to learn and act - and an\nintrinsic drive to continue to do so in as many ways as possible. Drawing\ninspiration from Friedrich Nietzsche's existentialist concept of will-to-power,\nwe examine how intrinsic drives to maximize control over future states, e.g.,\nempowerment, allow agents to increase the probability that they will be able to\nmeet their future homeostatic needs, thereby enhancing their capacity to\nmaintain physical integrity. We formalize these concepts within a reinforcement\nlearning framework, which enables us to examine how intrinsically driven\nembodied agents learning in open-ended multi-agent environments may cultivate\nthe capacities for open-endedness and care.ov"}
