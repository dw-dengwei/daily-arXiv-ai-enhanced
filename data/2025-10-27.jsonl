The\nworkflow leverages multimodal large language models (MLLMs) within a\nmulti-agent framework, combining perceptual extraction, human feedback, schema\nvalidation, and automated BIM scripting. Initially, sketches are iteratively\nrefined into a structured JSON layout of walls, doors, and windows. Later,\nthese layouts are transformed into executable scripts that generate 3D BIM\nmodels. Experiments on ten diverse floor plans demonstrate strong convergence:\nopenings (doors, windows) are captured with high reliability in the initial\npass, while wall detection begins around 83% and achieves near-perfect\nalignment after a few feedback iterations. Across all categories, precision,\nrecall, and F1 scores remain above 0.83, and geometric errors (RMSE, MAE)\nprogressively decrease to zero through feedback corrections.

To address these limitations, we propose EPFL-an Ensembled Penalized\nFederated Learning framework that integrates continual learning, personalized\nmodeling, and a novel Specialized Weighted Aggregation (SWA) strategy. EPFL\nleverages wearable sensor data to capture sequential motion patterns while\npreserving user privacy through homomorphic encryption and federated training.\nUnlike existing federated models, EPFL incorporates both penalized local\ntraining and ensemble-based inference to improve inter-client consistency and\nadaptability to behavioral differences.

While linear-quadratic models such as Holmstr\"om-Milgrom admit\nclosed-form solutions, realistic environments with nonlinear utilities,\nstochastic dynamics, or high-dimensional actions generally do not.\n  We introduce a generic algorithmic framework that removes this reliance on\nclosed forms. Our method adapts modern machine learning techniques for bilevel\noptimization -- using implicit differentiation with conjugate gradients (CG) --\nto compute hypergradients efficiently through Hessian-vector products, without\never forming or inverting Hessians. In benchmark CARA-Normal (Constant Absolute\nRisk Aversion with Gaussian distribution of uncertainty) environments, the\napproach recovers known analytical optima and converges reliably from random\ninitialization. More broadly, because it is matrix-free, variance-reduced, and\nproblem-agnostic, the framework extends naturally to complex nonlinear\ncontracts where closed-form solutions are unavailable, such as sigmoidal wage\nschedules (logistic pay), relative-performance/tournament compensation with\ncommon shocks, multi-task contracts with vector actions and heterogeneous\nnoise, and CARA-Poisson count models with $\\mathbb{E}[X\\mid a]=e^{a}$. This\nprovides a new computational tool for contract design, enabling systematic\nstudy of models that have remained analytically intractable."}

To address this, we propose a compositional bias,\na modular inductive bias decoupled from both objectives and architectures. Our\nkey insight is that different factors obey distinct recombination rules in the\ndata distribution: global attributes are mutually exclusive, e.g., a face has\none nose, while objects share a common support (any subset of objects can\nco-exist). We therefore randomly remix latents according to factor-specific\nrules, i.e., a mixing strategy, and force the encoder to discover whichever\nfactor structure the mixing strategy reflects through two complementary\nobjectives: (i) a prior loss that ensures every remix decodes into a realistic\nimage, and (ii) the compositional consistency loss introduced by Wiedemer et\nal.

For these problems, equivariant networks can help improve modeling\nacross undersampled parts of the input space, and uncertainty estimation can\nguard against overconfidence. However, until now, the relationships between\nequivariance and model confidence, and more generally equivariance and model\ncalibration, has yet to be studied. Since traditional classification and\nregression error terms show up in the definitions of calibration error, it is\nnatural to suspect that previous work can be used to help understand the\nrelationship between equivariance and calibration error. In this work, we\npresent a theory relating equivariance to uncertainty estimation. By proving\nlower and upper bounds on uncertainty calibration errors (ECE and ENCE) under\nvarious equivariance conditions, we elucidate the generalization limits of\nequivariant models and illustrate how symmetry mismatch can result in\nmiscalibration in both classification and regression. We complement our\ntheoretical framework with numerical experiments that clarify the relationship\nbetween equivariance and uncertainty using a variety of real and simulated\ndatasets, and we comment on trends with symmetry mismatch, group size, and\naleatoric and epistemic uncertainties."}

To overcome this limitation, we\npropose a framework that enables unified solvers to perceive the\nshared-component nature across VRP variants by proactively reusing basis\nsolvers, while mitigating the exponential growth of trained neural solvers.\nSpecifically, we introduce a State-Decomposable MDP (SDMDP) that reformulates\nVRPs by expressing the state space as the Cartesian product of basis state\nspaces associated with basis VRP variants.

Under mild assumptions, this extension\nprovably recovers the optimal unified policy of SDMDP through the mixture\nfunction that computes the state embedding as a mapping from the basis state\nembeddings generated by optimal basis policies. For practical implementation,\nwe introduce the Mixture-of-Specialized-Experts Solver (MoSES), which realizes\nbasis policies through specialized Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) experts, and\nimplements the mixture function via an adaptive gating mechanism.
